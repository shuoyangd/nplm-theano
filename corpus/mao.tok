LETTER TO TOTEH MIYA.ZAKI March 1917
&#91; Text &#93; Dear Mr Shiranami Toten : We have long admired your fame from afar , but have not had the occasion to meet you .
Hearing about you far avray , one cannot but be inspired .
You were most kind to Mr Huang .
During his lifetime , you rendered him moral support .
Now that he is dead , you mourn him with tears .
For his coming funeral , you have travelled 10,000 li to attend the burial .
Your friendship reaches to the sun and the moon ; your sincerity moves the gods .
What you do is rare in the world and unheralded at all times .
We are students of Hunan .
We have studied poetry and the classics , and we hold ambitions in our heart .
We wish to meet you and hear your instructions .
We hope you will grant us the opportunity .

STUDY OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION 1 April 1917
&#91; Text &#93; The national strength is weak ; the martial arts are not flourishing .
The physical quality of the nation becomes ever more debilitated .
This is a distressing situation .
As those advocating physical education do not reach the source , their effort has produced no result over a long period of time .
Not only has there been no improvement , but the weakness worsens .
Hitting the mark and reaching far are external matters , the results .
Fullness in physical strength is internal , the cause .
When the body is not firm , one is afraid of arms .
How can one hit the mark ?
And how can one reach far ?
Firmness comes from tempering ; tempering comes from awareness .
It isn &apos;t that today &apos;s physical education advocates do not think of all kinds of means , yet they produce no result .
It is because the external force cannot stimulate the mind .
They do not know the true meaning of physical education .
When it comes to the value of physical education , its effect , or where to start , they are in a fog .
No wonder they produce no result .
To make physical education effective , we must promote subjective awareness .
Once there is awareness , the particulars of physical education will become clear without need of explanation , and the effect of hitting the mark and reaching far will appear without seeking .
I deeply feel the importance of physical education , but regret the improper approach of the advocates .
I know that there are many who feel like I do .
Setting aside my diffidence , I would like to present my views for discussion .
What I say is not all practical , and maybe much is mere empty words and ideals .
I do not wish to deceive you .
Should you favor me with your thoughts and instructions , I shall be humbly grateful .
Explanation of Physical Education
Ever since the beginning of mankind , be they wise or obtuse , there has been no one who does not protect his own life .
Therefore , the ferns of the western hills were eaten when hungry ; the plums on top of the well were swallowed .
Using timber for shelter and pelts for clothesit was instinctive , without knowing the reasons .
But it was not refined .
The sages appeared .
Then , there were rites , and there was order in daily living .
In his private life , Confucius was serene and at peace .
He ate no spoilt
meat .
When he went shooting in the garden , spectators lined up like a wall .
The structure of the human body is no different from the animals , and yet the animals do not .live as long as man .
It is because the animals do not have order in their lives .
Man regulates his life , becoming ever more so with time .
Therefore , there is physcial education .
Physical education is the way to foster life .
Different people follow different ways .
Chuang @-@ tzu learned from the cook ; Confucius pursued archery and charioteering .
In today &apos;s civilized nations , Germany is the most advanced .
The popularity of fencing spreads in the entire country .
Japan has its samurai and recently , influenced hy China , judo .
They are most impressive .
However , when we study their contents , they are all based on physiology , the structure of the human , body , the movement of the vessels and energy , the parts which develop the earliest , and the parts which are deficient .
Their physical education follows such order , checking the excessive and remedying the deficient .
In conclusion , it is for the balanced development of the body .
Therefore , physical education is the way of mankind to foster life , enabling the body to develop in a balanced manner and according to order .
The Position of Physical Education
Physical education supplements ethical and academic education .
Yet , virtue and wisdom both rely on the body .
Without the body , there can be neither virtue nor wisdom .
But there are few who are aware of it .
Some stress wisdom ; others say virtue is the most important .
Knowledge is truly valuable .
That is where man is different from animals .
Yet what is the vessel of knowledge ?
Virtue is truly valuable .
It is order and equity among men .
Yet what is the lodge of virtue ?
The body is the vessel of knowledge and the lodge of virtue .
Like a cart , it carries knowledge ; like a house , it shelters virtue .
The body is the cart to carry knowledge and the house to shelter virtue .
Children , upon reaching the proper age , enter elementary schoool .
During elementary school , the development of the body should be specially stressed , while the improvement of knowledge and the building of virtue are secondary .
Fostering and caring are major matters , while teaching and training are supplementary .
Today , many people are ignorant of this principle .
Therefore , there have been children who became sick or died as a result of studying .
In middle school and above , the three kinds of education should be equally stressed .
Today , most people incline to stress the academic .
In middle school years , the body is not fully developed , yet today there are less people who build it and more who destroy it .
Will it not suspend development ?
Under the education system of China today , the subjects are so numerous that even adults with a strong body cannot handle them , let alone the young and the weak .
It seems that the educators purposely set up such a tedius and heavy curriculum to harass the students in order to trample their body and sabotage their life .
Those refusing to accept it are punished ; those with superior ability are assigned additional books , induced by sweet words and tempted by large rewards .
Alas , the students seem to hate their own life and wish to destroy and sacrifice it !
How muddled can they be ?
Man &apos;s only worry is not to have a body ; there is no other worry .
Once the body is sound , everything else follows .
There
is nothing better than physical education to improve the body .
Physical education should be of primary importance .
Once the body is strong , one can advance vigorously and effectively in the academic and the ethical aspects .
Physical education should be considered an important part of our study .
There must be the primary and the secondary , and the beginning and the end .
Such is the way .

The Defects.of Physical Education in the Past and What Should Be Done
The three kinds of education should be equally stressed .
Yet scholars of the old days stressed the moral and the academic while ignoring the physical .
The results were slight body and bowed head , and fragile white hands ; short of breath when climbing a mountain and cramped legs when crossing a water .
Yen @-@ tzu and Chia @-@ sheng were short @-@ lived ; Wang Po and Lu Chao @-@ ling either died young or became crippled .
They were all superior in virtue and wisdom .
Yet one day when the body no longer existed , , their virtue and wisdom perished also .
That the North was powerful was because there were many able @-@ bodied men .
The patriots and warriors mostly came from Liang @-@ chou .
In the beginning of the Ch &apos;ing Dynasty , Yen Hsi @-@ chai and Li Kang @-@ chu were scholars and warriors simultaneously .
Yen Hsi @-@ chai travelled 1,000 li to learn the skill of fencing and beat the warriors in a match .
Therefore he said that one must master both knowledge and martial arts .
Ku Yen @-@ nan was a Southerner , but he preferred to live in the North and liked horses more than boats .
These ancients are worthy of our emulation .
With the establishment of schools , the ways of other nations have been adopted , and there has been some change in the customs .
Yet the educators * as a result of what they learned before , cannot free themselves from the old ways .
They seek external display only , ignoring the fundamental while pursuing the details .
Therefore , I feel that today &apos;s physical education has the form but not the substance .
There exist the physical education course and the physical education teacher , but few benefits and there is more harm than good .
The teacher gives the orders , and the students force themselves to obey .
The body follows but the mind refuses , and there is immeasurable mental agony .
Mental agony brings physical agony .
At the end of a physical education session , everyone is exhausted in body and spirit .
When the food and drink are not clean , inorganic matter and germs enter the body and cause disease .
Improper lighting damages the eyesight .
Improper heights of the tables and chairs damage the body .
Such instances are too many to be enumerated .
Then what should our students do ?
The school equipment and the teachers &apos; teaching are external objective matters , while we still have our internal subjective matters .
The mind determines all , and the body follows the order of the mind .
The good or the bad all depends on ourselves .
We get what we want .
This applies to physical education .
If we do not arouse ourselves , even if the external objective matters are perfect , we will not benefit from them .
Therefore , we must begin with our own initiative in physical education .
The Effect of Physical Education
As man is an animal , he acts .
As he is a rational animal , he always acts with a reason .
Why is man &apos;s action valuable ?
Why is man &apos;s rational action valuable ?
In a narrow sense , action is to make a living .
In a broad sense , it is to defend the nation .
Neither constitutes the principal significance .
Action is to foster our life and please our mind .
Chu @-@ tzu advocated respect ; Lu @-@ tzu urged tranquillity .
Tranquillity is inaction .
Neither is respect ; it is also inaction .
Lao @-@ tzu said that inaction was great ; Shih @-@ shih sought quietude .
Mediation was followed by the disciples of Chu and Lu .
Recently someone by the name of Yin @-@ shih @-@ tzu promoted mediation , bragging about its Ingenuity and scorning action for being self @-@ destruetive .
That may be one way , but I cannot subscribe to it .
According to my opinion , action is the only thing in the world .
The action of man , when regulated , is physical education .
As stated before , the effect of physical education is the strengthening of tendons and bones .
I once heard that manTs structure and blood vessels were determined at a given age and could not be changed .
Usually after age 25 there was no further change .
Now I know it is not so .
Man &apos;s body changes every day .
Metabolism goes on continuously in the tissues .
Eyesight and hearing can be improved .
Even those 60 or 70 years old can change their physical structure .
I also heard that it was difficult for the weak to become strong .
Now I have also found out that it is not 30 .
For those who are born strong , if they abuse themselves , indulging in addictions and relying on their natural strength , they will become weak .
As for the weak , as they are aware of the imperfections of their body and fearful of dying young , they are careful with themselves .
In the negative aspect , they strictly abstain from addictions , afraid to do damage .
In the positive aspect , they diligently temper themselves ^ remedying their deficiencies , and they become strong after a prolonged effort .
Therefore , those who are born strong have no need to congratulate themselves , and those born weak have no need to feel sorry for themselves .
I was born weak , but maybe Heaven wants to induce me to become strong .
Famous athletes in the West , such as AmericaTs Roosevelt , German &apos;s ( Sun @-@ t &apos;ang ) , and Japan &apos;s Kano , all attained the greatest of strength from the weakest of bodies .
I also heard that the mental and the physical could not be both perfect , and that those using their mind were often deficient in body , and vice versa .
Such theory is also fallacious .
It only applies to those who have no determination ; it does not cover everyone .
Confucious died at age 72 , and one has never heard of him suffering from ill health .
Buddha travelled incessantly to spread the doctrines , and he also died at an old age .
Jesus unfortunately met with an unjust death .
Mohammad , with the Koran in his left hand and a sword in his right , conquered the world .
They were all sages of ancient times and the greatest thinkers .
Today &apos;s Mr Wu Chih @-@ yung is in his 70 &apos;s , and he thinks he will live to 100 .
He also is a man using his mind .
Wang Hsiang @-@ ch &apos;i died when he was in his 70 &apos;s .
He was healthy and alert up until then .
How can all such instances
be explained by the above fallacy ?
In sum , physical education strengthens the tendons and bones ; when the tendons and bones are strengthened , the quality of the body will change .
The weak will become strong , and the body and the mind will both become perfect .
It is not destiny , but man &apos;s effort .
Not just strengthening the tendons and bones , but physical education will also increase knowledge .
There is a recent saying : Civilize the spirit ; barbarize the body .
It is an apt statement .
To civilize the spirit , the body must first be barbarized .
Once the body is barbarized , civilized spirit follows .
Knowledge is to understand the things in the world and render judgment .
This requires physical effort .
Direct observation depends on the ears and eyes ; thinking depends on the brain .
The ears and eyes and the brain are parts of the body .
Only when the body is sound will knowledge become perfect .
Therefore , one can say that knowledge is acquired indirectly through physical education .
There are hundreds of fields of study today .
Whether to study in school or by oneself , those who can handle the task are strong in body , and those who cannot are weak .
The realms of the strong and the weak are different .
Not just increasing knowledge , but physical education will also harmonize the emotions .
Emotions are very powerful in man .
The ancients controlled them with reason .
Thus , it was said that the master was always alert .
It was also said that reason controlled the mind .
Nevertheless , reason comes from the mind , and the mind exists in the body .
The weak are often enslaved by their emotions and cannot extricate themselves .
The crippled are often unbalanced In their emotions and cannot be saved by their reason .
Only when the body is sound will the emotions be harmonized .
It is an immutable principle .
Take the following instance : When we encounter an unpleasantness and become excited , our mind is disturbed and we cannot control ourselves , but .if we engage in vigorous exercises , we can immediately cleanse ourselves of the old concept and clarify our mind .
An instant effect is produced .
Not just harmonizing the emotions , but physical education will strengthen our determination .
This is where the major effect of physical education lies The essential point of physical education is courage , and the goal of courage , such as bravery , fearlessnes , intrepidity , and perseverance , belongs to the realm of determination .
Take the following instance : Cold water baths will train one to be brave and fearless , as well as Intrepid .
In any kind of exercise , one must persist steadily , leading toward perseverance .
Long @-@ distance running , for example , is most apparent in perseverance .
The strength to extract the mountain and the bearing to conquer the world were nothing but bravery .
The determination not to return home before killing Lou @-@ lan was nothing but fearlessness .
Converting the family into the country was nothing but intrepidity .
Passing by the door of his home three times without entering after an absence of 8 year.s was nothing but perseverance .
All these qualities can be attributed to constant physical education .
Determination is the harbinger of one &apos;s career .
Those slight of limb are flighty in behavior ; those slack of muscle are soft and slow in mind .
Thus the body influences the mind .
Physical education strengthens the tendons and bones , thereby increasing knowledge , thereby harmonizing the emotions , and thereby reinforcing determination , The tendons and bones are our body , while knowledge , emotions , and determination constitute our mind .
When the body and the mind are both sound , there is excellence .
Therefore , physical education is the only thing to foster our body and please our mind .
Reasons for Aversion To Exercise
Exercise is the most important part of physical education .
Most of today &apos;s scholars dislike exercise .
There are four reasons : One is the lack of awareness .
For something to materialize in one &apos;s action , there must first be an inclination toward it .
But even more than inclination , one must first have the intelligence to gain a detailed understanding of it .
Understanding is awareness .
Most people do not know the relationship between exercise and themselves .
Or , they may have a rough idea , but have no detailed knowledge .
Therefore , their intelligence is not activated , and their senses not stimulated .
That some people can study science diligently is because of its close relationship with themselves .
If they do not study it today , they will not have the means to make a living in the future .
But when it comes to exercise , they do not have such awareness .
This is partly because they do not ponder profoundly , and partly because the teachers do not know how to enlighten them .
Another reason is that old habits are difficult to change .
In China , we have always stressed the academic .
&quot; Good men do not serve as soldiers . &quot; Though we know that exercise is proper and that the nations have become strong due to exercise , the force of the old concepts remains strong .
Exercise , which is a new concept , is only half accepted .
Therefore , it is not surprising .that many people do not like exercise .
The third reason is the lack of promotion .
This point can be further subdivided into two factors .
First , the so @-@ called educators today mostly do not understand physical education .
Hearing about it but not knowing what it is , they also engage in physical education .
Therefore , they have neither the sincerity nor the method .
As a result , they only discourage students from studying it .
When a profligate talks about independence , or a drunk discusses abstinence , naturally no one will believe them .
Second , the physical education teachers are mostly uneducated .
Their language is so coarse that the listeners have to cover their ears .
They only know one skill , and not necessarily expert at it .
Day in and day out , they perform the mechanical movements .
Anything in form only , without substance , cannot exist .
Such is today &apos;s physical education .
The fourth reason is that the students think of exercise as something shameful .
I personally feel that this is the major reason for disliking , exercise .
As society prefers a well @-@ dressed man with gentlemanly manners , it makes people feel ashamed to expose their arms and legs and wave them around .
Therefore , there are those who know the importance of exercise and wish to exercise , but cannot do so .
Others can exercise in a group but not by themselves .
Still others will exercise
in private but not in public .
In a word , it is due to bashfulness .
The foregoing are the four reasons for aversion to exercise .
The first and fourth are subjective , and it is up to the individual .
The second and third are objective , and it is up to others .
A gentleman relies on himself .
He must disregard what is up to others .
Fewer Methods of Exercise Preferred
Being weak , I wanted to study the means to improve my health .
The ancients discussed the subject extensively .
Now the schools have gymnasiums and books .
After much studying , I was not benefited .
The reason is that practice , rather than words , is important .
If one can practice , learning a little bit is enough .
Tseng Wen @-@ cheng was greatly benefited by washing his feet before retiring and walking 1,000 steps after a meal .
One old man was very healthy even at 80 years of age .
When asked , he said : &quot; I do not eat my fill . &quot; Today , there are hundreds of exercises .
A bird needs only one branch in the forest to build a nest ; a field mouse needs only a stomachful out of a river .
We have only this one body , only so many bones and vessels .
All the 100 methods of exercise are only for the purpose of blood circulation .
One method will serve the purpose .
Thus , 99 out of the 100 methods can be discarded .
The eyes can see clearly if they do not see two things at a time , and the ears can hear clearly if they do not hear two things at a time .
To temper the tendons and bones with 100 methods only serve to disturb them , and the desired result may not follow .
What is suitable for different purposes is not the same as tempering one &apos;s own body .
There are the swinging.bridge for the sailor , pole carrying for the pole @-@ vaulter , games for the elementary school , and military maneuvering for the middle school and above .
They are for different purposes .
Exercising the tendons and bones will help blood circulation .
It is for tempering one &apos;s own body .
There should be more methods when there are different purposes , but less for tempering one &apos;s own body .
Today &apos;s scholars often do not realize its resulting in two defects .
Those who like to exercise think the more the better.-To do 100 things with one body , one may not benefit at all .
In regard to those who do not like to exercise , when they see others possessing so many skills , they feel so inadequate that they may give up altogether .
More is not necessarily good , and less not necessarily bad .
Even the bending and stretching of one arm or one leg , if done regularly , it will produce a benefit .
Only when this is understood will there be improvement in physical education .
Important Points in Exercising
Constancy is required in all undertakings , and this applies to exercise .
Of two men exercising , one of them does it sporadically , while the other perseveres diligently .
The results will be different .
First , constancy in exercising will produce an interest .
The static cannot move by itself .
There must be something to make it move .
To move is due to interest .
All &apos; sciences produce interests in many aspects , and this applies to exercise also .
It is restful to be quiet but tiring to move .
Man usually prefers
leisure to effort .
If there Is nothing to make him move , then his status and preference cannot be changed .
Interest comes from daily exercise .
It is best to exercise upon rising and before retiring .
It is preferable to be naked .
Or , wear very thin clothes , because too many clothes are clumsy.-Doing it daily will produce the concept of exercise , continuous and uninterrupted .
Today &apos;s exercise is a continuation of yesterday &apos;s and the forerunner of tomorrow &apos;s .
It does not have to be long .
Some 30 minutes will be enough .
By so doing , a sort of interest will naturally follow .
Secondly , constancy in exercising will bring happiness .
After exercising over a long period , the result will become apparent , and one will feel a respect for oneself .
One will become efficient in studying and JUnbuilding one &apos;s ethics .
One will feel an unlimited happiness .
All these come from constancy .
Happiness must be distinguished from interest .
Interest is -the beginning of exercising , and happiness its end .
Interest comes from doing while happiness comes from the result .
Bie two are different .
Constancy without attention will not produce results .
Like viewing flowers while riding a fast horse , even if one views the flowers every day , it is equivalent to not viewing .
Thus , full attention is required when exercising .
One must brush aside all idle thoughts and irrelevant worries , and concentrate on the circulation of blood , tensing and relaxing of the muscles , bending of the joints , and breathing .
The movements must follow a rhythm , bending and stretching , advancing and retreating , all done conscientiously .
According to Chu @-@ tzu , one must concentrate on eating when eating , and on putting on clothes when dressing .
The same principle applies to exercising .
A gentleman is civilized and docile , but this does not apply to exercising .
One must be barbarous and solid .
Only then will one build up one &apos;s strength and the tendons and bones .
The method of exercising should be solid .
Being solid will make it substantial and easy to practice .
It is most important , especially for those who are beginners .
The three important points in exercising are constancy , concentration , and being barbarous and solid .
There are many other points of attention , but these are the important ones .
What I Have Gained Through Exercise
I dabbled in all kinds of exercises , but it was all external tempering , without something which could be considered my own .
Thus , I extracted the good points of the various exercises and created a new one .
I have greatly benefited from it .
It consists of six sections : Arms , legs , body , head , hitting , and harmonizing .
The sections are further divided into 27 steps .
It is called the six @-@ section exercise , which is described below .
I hope my readers will correct me .
Arm exercise , sitting position
( 1 ) Form fists ; stretch and retract in a forward movement , left and right alternating , three times .
Left and right alternating means when the left is in motion the right rests , and vice versa .
( 2 ) Form fists ; bend elbows ; make semi @-@ circular motions by moving forward , sideways , and backward , left and right alternating , three times .
( 3 ) Form fists ; stretch and retract in a downward motion , left and right together , three times .
Left and right together means both sides moving together , not alternating .
( 4 ) Palms up ; stretch forward , left and right alternating , three times .
( 5 ) Palms down ; stretch forward , left and right alternating , three times .
( 6 ) Stretch fingers ; bend elbows ; thrust forward , left and right alternating , three times ,
Leg exercise , sitting position
( 1 ) Hands form fists hanging downward .
Legs remain at original position ; bend forward and stretch sideways , left and right alternating , three times .
( 2 ) Hands form fists level in front .
Legs stretch sideways ; then bend forward .
Position may change when stretching ; use toes when tending ; touch heels with buttocks ; left and right alternating , three times .

INAUGURAL STATEMENT OF &apos; HSIANG @-@ CHIANG P &apos;lNG @-@ LUN1 14 July 1919
&#91; Text &#93; With the rising roar of the &quot; world revolution &quot; and the striking progress of the &quot; emancipation of mankind &quot; movement , we must change our old concepts of the issues which we have never doubted before , the methods which we have never adopted before , and the words which we have always been afraid to utter .
We doubt what we have never before doubted .
We adopt what we have never before adopted .
We are no longer afraid .
Such trend cannot be blocked by any force , and it cannot but influence people , regardless of who they are .
What is the biggest issue in the world ?
The issue of food is the biggest .
What force is the strongest ?
The force of mass unity is the strongest .
What should not be feared ?
Fear neither Heaven , nor ghosts , nor the dead , nor the bureaucrats , nor the warlords , nor the capitalists .
With the Renaissance and the emancipation of thinking , &quot; how man should live &quot; became a big issue .
When this issue was studied , the conclusion that &quot; this is the way to live &quot; and &quot; that is not the way to live &quot; was reached .
With the scholars taking the lead and the majority of the people echoing them , many reforms were accomplished , or almost accomplished .
In religion , the Reformation resulted in freedom of religion .
In literature , the literature of the aristocrats , the classic literature , and the dead literature became the literature of the people , modern literature , and living literature .
In politics , tyranny became parliamentarism , and restricted election became unrestricted .
In society , the dark society under the tyranny of the minority class became a bright society of the free development of all people .
In education , there was the principle of popular education .
In economics , there was the principle of to each according to his labor .
In thinking , there was experimentalism .
Internationally , there was the international alliance .
In a word , all the reforms are the results of &quot; freedom from might . &quot; The fundamental ideology of the many forces opposing might is &quot; popular @-@ ism &quot;
( democracy , also known as democratic theory , people @-@ ism , or plebeian @-@ ism ) .
The might of religion , of literature , of politics , of society , of education , of economics , and of thinking , and international might have not any room for existence .
They must all be overthrown by the loud appeal of popular @-@ ism .
As for the means of overthrowing them , there are two theories : One is violent and the other moderate .
We must make our choice between the two .
( 1 ) We recognize that all those exercising might are human beings , and our fellow creatures .
Abusing power is their unconscious error and their misfortune , resulting from contamination and harm by the old society and old thinking .
( 2 ) The result of overthrowing might by force is still might .
Not only is it contradictory , but also ineffective .
The European war between the &quot; Allies &quot; and the &quot; Central Powers &quot; and China &apos;s civil war between the North and the South were all instances of such .
Therefore , according to our view , we advocate thorough study in the academic aspect , untrammeled by legends and superstitions , and we must spread the truth .
In regard to the human element , we advocate mass unity , continuing our &quot; counseling movement &quot; toward those in power , and practicing &quot; revolution by appeals &quot; appeal for bread , appeal for freedom , and appeal for equality , or , &quot; bloodless revolution . &quot; It will not lead to any major chaos or the ineffective &quot; revolution by bombs &quot; and &quot; bloody revolution . &quot;
International might pressing in on us is Japan .
The various movements , such as student strikes , market strikes , work strikes , and boycotting are the effective means to handle the mighty Japan directly or indirectly .
Hsiang @-@ chiang is a river in the east of the Eastern hemisphere on the globe .
Its water is clear and its flow long .
The people living on its shores and in its vicinity are ignorant and uninformed .
They know little of the affairs of the world .
They do not have an organized society .
Everyone for himself and scattered , they only have the narrowest self and the shortest time , They have never dreamed of the common life or the long @-@ range concept .
In politics , they have not reached a thorough solution .
They only know private struggles .
Engulfed by the tidal waves of the external world , they have also undertaken some education , but without much effect .
The bureaucratic educators , inflexible and stereotyped , consider the school a jail and the students prisoners .
They have not developed their industry .
The few useful talents among them acquired learning and art by studying abroad or in outside areas , but there is no room for them to make use of their talents .
The confining Tung @-@ tTing Lake blocks them gently .
Entrenched in tribal thinking , the practice the principle of Hunan &apos;s rice for Hunan &apos;s people .
Those in education and industry cannot tolerate those differing from them .
Their mind is Impoverished and decadent and needs improvement , yet there is no one to undertake the task .
They have many young men in school , full of potential , yet there is no one to enlighten them with new knowledge and new art by an effective means .
Alas !
Hsiang @-@ chiang , Hsiang @-@ chiang !
Like a pillar you exist on this Earth !
The opportunity has arrived !
The great tide of the world surges forward !
The locks of Tung @-@ t &apos;ing Lake are moving , and opening !
The powerful new trend is roaring along the shores of Hsiang @-@ chiang !
Those following it will live ; those resisting it will die .
How to receive it ?
How to spread it ?
How to study it ?
How to promulgate it ?
These constitute the most intimate and most important great issues of all the people of Hunan as well as &quot; Hsiang @-@ chiang &quot; upon its birth .

A HSIANG @-@ CHIANG P &apos;lNG @-@ LUN , Inaugural Issue , 14 July 1919
GREAT UNION OF THE PEOPLE 21 , 28 July , 4 August 1919 &#91; Text &#93; ( 1 )
The state is at its worse ; the misery of man is at its extreme ; society is at its darkest .
The means of remedy , of reform ?
While education , industry , effort , progress , destruction , and construction are all correct , the fundamental means is the great union of the people .
When we look back at history , no movement vas not the result of the union of certain people .
The bigger movements required bigger unions ; the biggest movements required the biggest unions .
Such union was most apparent at the time of reform or resistance .
Always , the reform or resistance of religion , of the arts , of politics , and of society resulted from bigger unions .
The outcome of victory or defeat depended on the strength or weakness of the union and on whether the principle of the union was new or old , true or false .
The measure of uniting was always the same .
Most of the ancient unions were those of the powerful , of the aristocrats , and of the capitalists .
The many kinds of &quot; alliance &quot; agreements in diplomacy , for instance , were the union of international powers .
China &apos;s &quot; Pei @-@ yang Faction &quot; and &quot; Southwest Faction , &quot; and Japan &apos;s &quot; Satsuma clan and Choshu clan , &quot; for instance , were the unions of domestic power holders ; the political parties and parliaments of the various nations were the unions of aristocrats and capitalists , ( While the upper house , being the house of the elders , was the den where the aristocrats converged , the lower house , with its voting rights restricted by property , was mostly monopolized by the capitalists ) .
As for the trusts ( iron and steel trust , petroleum trust ... ) and corporations ( the Japan Steamship Corporation , Manchurian Iron Corporation ... ) , they were purely unions of capitalists .
By the present time , the unions of the powerful , the aristocrats , and the capitalist have reached the limit ; therefore , the state is at its worst , the misery of man is at its extremej and society is at its darkest , resulting in reform , in resistance , and in the great union of the people .
Since the victory of the &quot; political reform &quot; in France as a result of the great union of the people against that of the royalists , the various nations followed suit and produced many &quot; political reforms . &quot; Since the victory of the &quot; social reform &quot; in Russia last year as a result of the great union of the people against that of the aristocrats and capitalists , the various nations , such as Hungary , Austria , Czechoslovakia , and Germany , followed suit and produced many social reforms .
Though the victory is not yet complete , that it will inevitably become complete and spread worldwide can be imagined .
Why is the great union of the people so powerful ?
Because the people of a nation are always greater in number than the aristocrats , capitalists , and other power holders .
Since the number of aristocrats , capitalists , and other power holders is small , what they rely on to defend their own special interests and exploit the public interest of the people are knowledge , money , and force .
Education in the old days was the special privilege of the aristocrats and capitalists , which the ordinary people had no opportunity to enjoy .
Since , knowledge was monopolized , the intelligent and uninformed classes were created .
Money is the medium of living , and everyone should be able to get it .
Yet the knowledgeable aristocrats and capitalists , fay such means as &quot; capital concentration , &quot; gradually directed it into the hands of the landowners and plant bosses .
While they made land , machinery , and houses their own and called them &quot; fixed property , &quot; they gathered money , the so @-@ called movable property , into their _ treasury ( banks ) , The millions of common people working for them were given francs and pennies .
Since those who work had no money , the rich and poor classes were created .
With knowledge and money , the aristocrats and capitalists set up camps to train soldiers and plants to make guns .
Under the excuse of &quot; foreign aggression , &quot; tens of divisions and hundreds of battalions were recruited .
Imitating conscription , they invented the &quot; selective service system . &quot; Thus , the vigorous sons of the people became soldiers .
When a problem was encountered , they brought out the machine guns to attack their incapable and weak old men .
When the Southern army was defeated in Hunan , didn &apos;t they kill many of their old men ?
The aristocrats and capitalists utilized @-@ such ingenious methods , and the ordinary people were afraid to express themselves .
Thus were created the strong and weak classes .
Luckily the ordinary people surreptitiously studied some of their &quot; secret &quot; textbooks , and gradually acquired knowledge .
Envying the comfort of the capitalists , the ordinary people eyed the farmland and plants where money came from .
As for the soldiers in the camps , they were their sons , brothers , or husbands .
When the soldiers aimed the machine guns at them , they shouted in a loud voice .
Such shouts turned the bullets into mud .
Unconsciously , they returned home together hand in hand , changing together into staunch warriors against the aristocrats and capitalists .
We only have to look at the hundreds of thousands of troops of Russia which suddenly substituted the red flag for the vulture flag to understand the profound reason therein .
The ordinary people saw through the three methods of the aristocrats and capitalists and realized that they practice them by means of union .
They
also saw that they were few and we were many , and so they resorted to the great union .
In regard to the actions after union , one faction was very violent , &quot; used their own medicine , &quot; and waged a death struggle against them .
The leader of this faction was a man born in Germany named Marx .
The other faction was more moderate , did not seek instant results , but began ty working toward the awareness of the ordinary people .
Everyone must possess the virtues of mutual aid and voluntary work .
As long as they would repent and were able to work , and would help , rather than hurt , others , it was not necessary to kill the aristocrats and capitalists .
The intent of those of this faction was more extensive and profound .
They wished to unite the entire earth into one nation and all mankind into one family .
With harmony and friendshipnot Japan &apos;s friendship , together they would strive for prosperity in the world .
The leader of this faction was a man born in Russian by the name of Kropotkin .
We must know that anything in the world is easy to do to start with .
What is not easy is due to the influence of historyhabit .
If we can shout in unison , we will break down the influence of history .
We must unite even more extensively and , when we encounter what we feel is wrong , we must form our ranks and loudly , shout at the opposing side .
We have already had the experience : Lu Jung @-@ tfing &apos;s &#91; 7120 2837 1694 &#93; shells would never hit the villains like Ts &apos;ao Ju @-@ lin &#91; 2580 3067 7207 &#93; , But when we rose up and shouted , the villians stood up and trembled ; they fled for their lives .
We must know that our brothers of other nations constantly resort to this means to seek their interest .
We must emulate them .
We must form our great union !
( II ) Small Unions as the Foundation
In a previous issue of this newspaper , the possibility and necessity of the &quot; great union of the people &quot; were covered .
Today , the means of the great union will be discussed .
It is the &quot; small unions of the people . &quot;
What we want is a sort of great union , in order to resist those holding power and injuring others and attain our own interest .
Then , we must have all kinds of small unions to serve as its foundation .
Man has the instinctive talent for union .
It is the talent to form groups , the talent to organize society .
&quot; Group &quot; and &quot; society &quot; are what I refer to as &quot; union . &quot; There are large groups and small groups , large societies and small societies , and large unions and small unions , the same thing in different names .
That we must have a group , a society , and a union is because we want to seek our common interest .
Due to the differences in our circumstances and occupations , the sphere of our common interest also varies .
As there are large and small common interests , the means to attain common interest ( union ) also differs in size .
Gentlemen !
We are peasants .
We must form a union of those of our kind in order to seek the various interests of the peasants .
The interests of the peasants must be sought by the peasants themselves .
As those not engaged
in farming do .
not have the same interests , they will not help us .
Farming gentlemen !
How do the landlords treat us ?
Are the rents heavy or light ?
Is our housing adequate ?
Are our stomachs full ?
Is the farmland too little ?
Are there people in the village without farms ?
We must constantly seek the answers to these questions .
We must form a union with those of our own kind , and concretely .and openly seek the answers .
Gentlemen !
We are workers .
We must form a union with those of our own kind in order to seek the interests of the workers .
The various problems connected with our labor , such as the amount of wages , the hours , whether there is equal distribution of profit , whether there is improvement in recreation ... , all require answers .
We must form a union with those of our own kind , and concretely and openly seek the answers *
Gentlemen !
We are students .
We have a hard time .
Those teaching us treat us as enemies , trample us as slaves , and confine us as prisoners .
The windows of our classrooms are so small that the light cannot reach the blackboard , making us nearsighted .
The tables are unsuitable , and we suffer from &quot; spinal curvature &quot; after sitting over them too long .
The teachers only want us to read more books .
We read many books , but we cannot understand them , merely wasting the effort of memorizing .
Our eyes are blurred , our brains confused , our blood deficient , and our complexion pale .
We suffer from anemia and neurasthenia .
Why are we so stiff ?
So dull ?
So wasted ?
They are all because the teachers force us to stay still and keep quiet .
We are stiff like corpses .
Physical pain is still secondary .
Gentlemen !
Please take a look at our laboratories !
They are so cramped and so poorly equippeda few pieces of broken instruments .
It is impossible for us to do any experiment .
Our Chinese language teachers are so cantankerous .
Quoting the classics endlessly , they do not understand the meaning .
Unaware that it is not the 20th century , they continue to force us to perform the &quot; ancient rites &quot; and follow the &quot; ancient laws &quot; and stuff the classical dead literature into our mind .
Our library is empty ; our recreation field dirty .
The nation is perishing , yet they still post announcements prohibiting us from being patriotic .
Take the save @-@ the @-@ nation movement this time : We received must of their generosity !
Alas !
Who are destroying our body and spirit and making us miserable ?
If we do not unite now and pursue our &quot; self @-@ education , &quot; when will we do it ?
Sunk into an ocean of misery , we must save ourselves .
The &quot; self @-@ education &quot; invented by Rousseau is most appropriate .
We must line @-@ up our comrades wherever possible and study by ourselves .
We must not rely on the vicious teachers .
Whenever anything happens , such as the outrageous conduct of Japan &apos;s and our domestic power holders , we will form ranks and shout at them loudly .
Ladies !
We are women .
We have sunk even deeper into the ocean of misery !
Since we are also human beings , why are we not permitted to take part in politics ?
Since we are also human being , why are we not permitted to have social contact ?
We gather in holes and cannot step out of the front door .
The shameless men and the hoodlums consider us as playthings , force us into
long @-@ term prostitution , and destroy the freedom to love !
&quot; Chastity &quot; is limited to women !
There are many shrines for chaste women , but where are the temples for chaste men ?
Some of us gather in women &apos;s schools , but those teaching us are the shameless men and hoodlums .
All day long they discuss &quot; virtuous wife and good mother . &quot; It is for no other purpose than to teach us to specialize in long @-@ term prostitution .
They are afraid that we will not accept control .
What misery !
God of Freedom , where are you ?
Please rescue us !
We have awakened !
The women must unite and sweep aside all the evil ghosts violating us and destroying our physical and spiritual freedom !
Gentlemen !
We are elementary school teachers .
All day long we teach class and are very busy .
All day long we inhale chalk dust , and there is nowhere for us to relax .
Elementary school teachers in such a big city must number in the hundreds , in the thousands , yet there is no recreation facility for our use .
When we teach , we must constantly improve our learning , yet there is no research organ established for us .
The inflexible classroom hours are many , and there is no spare time , energy , or spirit to study .
Thus , we become phonographs , performing and reciting what our teachers taught us in the old days .
Our stomach is empty .
The monthly wage of 8 or 10 yuan is even discounted .
Some principals follow the method of &quot; reducing military ration &quot; and pocket the money allocated by the government .
Without money , we become.married widowers , living tens or hundreds of li away from our spouses .
We are told that teaching elementary school is a lifetime career .
Does it mean that we should spend our entire life as widowers or widows ?
According to the theory of education , the teachers and their families should live in the school in order to serve as models to the students , but it is impossible now .
As we have no money , we cannot buy books , nor travel and observe .
No need to say more !
Elementary school teachers are only slaves !
If we do not wish to be slaves , the only way is for us to unite with our own kind and form an elementary school teachers &apos; union .
Gentlemen !
We are policemen .
We also wish to unite with our own kind and form a union beneficial to our body and mind .
The Japanese say that the most miserable are beggars , elementary school teachers , and policemen .
We feel more or less the same .
Gentlemen !
We are cart pullers .
Our perspiration falls like rain .
The cart owners charge so much for rent , while the fare we get is so little !
How can we live ?
Is there also a method of union for us ?
The above are the wails of the peasants , workers , students , women , elementary school teachers , and cart pullers .
Unable to endure the misery any longer , they wish to form all kinds of small unions in their own interests .
Among the small unions discussed above , the union of workers is a very large and general term .
To put it in greater details , the following are of the lowest level in the workers1 unions : Unions of railway workers , of mining
Therefore , we must begin with the small unions when we want a large union .
We must emulate our fellow beings of other nations , and form many small unions .
( Ill ) The Situation of China &apos;s &quot; Great Union of the People &quot;
In the two previous installments we have discussed : ( 1 ) the possibility and necessity of a great union of the people and ( 2 ) the fact that the great union of the people is founded on the small unions .
Now , in regard to China &apos;s great union of the people , do we have the awareness ?
Do we have the motivation ?
Do we have the ability ?
Can we succeed ?
( 1 ) In regard to China &apos;s great union of the people , do we have the awareness ?
The revolution of 1911 appeared to be a union of the people , but it was actually not so .
The 1911 revolution was instigated by students studying abroad , encouraged by the Ko @-@ lao Society and fought by the soldiers of the new army and patrol camps .
It had nothing to do with the majority of the people .
Though we supported their principle , we did not take any active part .
Nor did they need us .
But we gained an awareness .
We found out that the sacred emperor could be overthrown and that the treacherous democracy could be established .
If we had anything to say or anything to do , we could say or do it at any time .
After 1911 , we again overthrew Emperor Hung @-@ hsien in 1916 .
Though it was undertaken by a minority , we realized that the arrogant Emperor Hung @-@ hsien could , also be overthrown .
In recent years , there were the civil war betwen the North and the South and the World War , and things changed even more .
The outcome of the civil war was that we acquired more ironclad evidence to show that the bureaucrats , military men , and politicians injured , poisoned , and exploited us .
The outcome of the World War was that the people of the nations , due to the hardships in their living , suddenly undertook many actions .
Russia overthrew the aristocrats and expelled the rich .
The workers and peasants jointly formed a provisional government .
The Red Flag Army fought everywhere and swept aside many enemies .
The alliance changed its form as a result , and the whole world was shaken .
Hungary rose , and a brand @-@ new worker @-@ peasant government appeared in Budapest .
The Germans , Austrians , and Czechoslovakians
responded and waged a death struggle against their domestic enemies .
The angry tide surged West and then shifted to the East .
After the many general strikes in England , France , Italy , and America , large scale uprisings broke out in India and Korea .
Then , there was the 4 May Movement in China between the Great Wall and Po @-@ hai .
Shifting the standards and banners toward the south , themovement crossed the Yellow River to the Yangtze , from Huang @-@ p &apos;u to Hankow , all the way to Tung @-@ t &apos;ing Lake and the Min River , the tide rising ever higher .
Heaven and Earth rose out of hibernation ; the treacherous and the evil fled .
Alas !
We understood !
We awakened !
The world is ours ; the nation is ours ; society is ours .
If we do not say it , who will ?
If we do not do it , who will ?
We must actively proceed with the urgent great union of the people !
( 2 ) Is there the motivation for China &apos;s great union of the people ?
In regard to this question , I will directly answer yes .
If you do not believe me , let me explain .
The origin of China &apos;s union of the people must be traced back to the establishment of the Provincial Bureau at the end of the Ch &apos;ing Dynasty and the formation of the revolutionary partythe Revolutionary Alliance .
With the Provincial Bureau , there was the joint petition of the provincial bureaus in the provinces for an early parliament .
With the revolutionary party , there was the appeal to those in China and abroad to launch an uprising and expel the .
Manchus .
The 1911 revolution was a joint venture by the Provincial Bureau and the revolutionary party .
Subsequently , the revolutionary party became the Kuomintang , and the Provincial Bureau the Progressive Party .
It was the beginning of political parties in China .
Thereafter , the republic was founded .
The central government convened the parliament , and the provinces also held provincial assemblies .
At this time , the provinces formed three kinds of organizations : Provincial education , commercial , and agricultural associations .
( Several provinces had labor associations ; others included the workers in the agricultural associations , such as Hunan ) .
Meanwhile , the counties also established county education , commercial , and agricultural associations .
( Some counties did not do so ) .
These constituted firm and effective unions .
Other types of organizations were also formed according to the conditions and situations , such as , alumni associations of the schools , fellow @-@ provincials1 associations for those away from home , general and branch associations of students returning from abroad , &quot; Shanghai Daily News &quot; Guild , World Chinese Students1 Association , Peking and Shanghai European and American Returning Students1 Associations , and Peking Chinese @-@ French Education Association .
All kinds of academic societies ( such as Ch &apos;iang Society , Kuang Society , Shang @-@ chih Society , China Vocational Education Association , China Science Association , Asian Civilization Association ... ) , all kinds of occupational or professional associations ( the various occupations and professions in industry and commerce , such as banking association , rice association ... ; research associations in the schools , such as the Painting Research and Philosophy Research Associations in Peking ... dozens of them ) , and all kinds of clubs were the products of political liberation and ideological
enlightenment not permissible or possible in the period of government by one man .
The above mentioned associations were all very simplethe &quot; small unions &quot; discussed in the previous installment .
Recently , due to political unrest and foreign pressure , our awareness has been raised and the motivation for large unions has appeared , such as the National United Association of Education Associations , the National United Association of Commercial Associations , the United Association of Canton &apos;s 72 Guilds , the United Association of Shanghai &apos;s 53 Organizations , the United Association of &quot; Shang @-@ hsueh Kung @-@ pao , &quot; the National United Association in the : Field of Newspapers , the National Hope @-@ for @-@ Peace Association , the National United Peace Association , the Peking China @-@ France Association , the People &apos;s Diplomacy Association , the Hunan Reconstruction Association ( in Shanghai ) , the Shantung Association ( in Shanghai ) , the united students1 associations of Peking , Shanghai , the provinces , and the cities , the united associations of all fields , the National United Students1 Association ... , Though many &quot; gentlemen &quot; and &quot; politicians &quot; who are not of the people are inevitably found in the various associations , societies , units , united associations , etc .
( such as the national parliament , provincial assemblies , provincial education associations , provincial agricultural associations , National Hope @-@ for @-@ Peace Association , and National United Peace Association , which are completely gentlemen &apos;s or politicians &apos; associations ) , the occupational or professional associations , academic societies , research associations , etc .
are purely organizations of ordinary people or scholars .
The united students &apos; associations and the united associations of the various fields created recently are a sort of great unions of the people organized purely to deal with foreign and domestic power holders .
I feel that here is the motivation for China &apos;s national great union .
( 3 ) Do we have the ability to undertake China &apos;s &quot; great union of the people ? &quot; Can we succeed ?
When it comes to ability , there are doubts .
The Chinese people only concentrate on maximum , yet futureless private profit .
Those in commerce fail to form corporations ; those working fail to establish labor parties ; those studying only follow the old method of making carts behind closed doors and fail to do joint research .
The Chinese people cannot undertake large scale organized enterprises .
That politics is not properly handled needs no mentioning .
The little achievement in postal and salt administration must be credited to the foreigners .
So long after the seas were opened for trade , we still do not have even a small ship which can travel to Europe .
&quot; Chao @-@ shang Chu &quot; and &quot; Han @-@ Yeh @-@ P &apos;ing , &quot; the only ones in the country , operated at a loss every year .
When they could not stand the loss , they recruited foreign capital .
Railways managed by foreigners are superior in cleanliness , equipment , and personnel .
Any railway managed by the Department of Communications becomes messed up .
All travelers on the Peking @-@ Hankow , Tientsin @-@ P &apos;u @-@ k &apos;ou , and Wuchfang @-@ Chrangsha lines have to cover their nose and grit their teeth !
As for the rest , the schools , self @-@ government , or even a family , an individual , is not properly handled .
&quot; Jackals of the same lair , &quot; that &apos;s what they are !
It is not easy to discuss the great union of the people !
It is not easy to compete against the deeply entrenched power holders !
Even so , it does not mean that we basically do not have the ability .
That we do not have the ability has its reasons .
It is because &quot; we have not practiced . &quot;
For thousands of years , the millions of Chinese people lived the life of slavery , and only the &quot; emperor &quot; was not a slave .
( Some people said that the &quot; emperor &quot; was the slave of &quot; Heaven . &quot; ) When the emperor was in charge , we were not allowed to practice our ability .
Politics , academic learning , and society all prohibited us from thinking , organizing , or practicing .
Today it is different .
All aspects have been liberatedthe liberation of thinking , of politics , of economics , of men and women , and of education .
We all wish to see the blue sky from the depth of hell .
The people of China have great abilities !
The stronger the pressure , the greater the reaction , After a long suppression , the eruption will be quick .
I would like to make a wild statement : The reform of the nation of China in the future will be more thorough than any other nation ; the Chinese society will be brighter than any other ; the great unity of the nation of China will be achieved ahead of any area and any nation .
Gentlemen !
Gentlemen !
We must exert ourselves !
We must strive forward !
Our golden world , our brilliant world , is ahead of us !

BUSINESS REPORT OF WEN @-@ HUA BOOKSTORE ( No 2 )
March 1921
&#91; Text &#93; I
Last year we issued a business report concerning the &quot; initiation &quot; and the condition of the &quot; temporary business period . &quot; Now , &quot; Business Report No 2 &quot; deals with the condition of the &quot; first half @-@ year &quot; from last September , when this bookstore was inaugurated , to the end of March this year .
The bookstore was opened at the beginning of last September ; therefore , it has been 7 months by the end of March this year , which is 1 month over the &quot; reporting every 6 months &quot; provided in the Organization Outline .
This is for the convenience of accounting .
Hereafter , &quot; reporting every 6 months &quot; in the Organization Outline will be observed .
In regard to the purpgse of this report , first , we want to report to our members how those members directly connected with the bookstore and those managing the business market the publications , so that our members will know the actual situation of the bookstore .
Only by so doing will we fulfill our responsibilities .
Second , the Chinese people always follow the policy of secrecy in doing business .
Besides the inner circle , no one knows what they are doing .
Such secret policy is actually a sin .
When one is open and aboveboard , why shouldn &apos;t the situation be made public ?
Wen @-@ hua Bookstore is an organization publicly owned by society ; it is not for private gain .
To avoid the sin of secrecy , we oppose secrecy and adopt complete openness , reporting all conditions of the bookstore to the public besides just the members .
Third , in regard to the missions of our bookstore , we stated in our &quot; Objective &quot; that &quot; ... we wish to introduce all kinds of new Chinese and foreign publications by the fastest and simplest method to serve as the study material of the young people and all the people of Hunan . &quot; In the &quot; Organization Outline , &quot; we also stated that &quot; ... all kinds of useful new publications will spread in the entire province and everyone will have the opportunity to read them . &quot; Such a great mission cannot be accomplished
by our few dozen members alone .
To attain the goal of &quot; everyone having the opportunity to read &quot; the publications , we give serious attention to setting up branches in the counties .
With one branch in each of t &amp; e .
74 counties , and 10 members per branch , we must have 750 members .
Therefore , the only way is to publish the business conditions , so that all those of like mind near and far will understand the benefits of the store , set up branches in all areas , and help us spread our intent by word or deed .
The goal of &quot; spreading in the entire province &quot; may then be reached .
Fourth , what our bookstore has are books and newspapers , but what it lacks is capital .
Why ?
Because books and newspapers come from outside , and we can have all we want , but capital comes from the members , and not all members are rich .
In addition , our members are not involved in just the bookstore alone so there is not that much money available to serve as capital .
Furthermore , this bookstore follows the principle of &quot; public assets , &quot; with no withdrawal or interest , so our poor members cannot produce much money .
Nevertheless , the undertaking of Wen @-@ hua Bookstore is definitely something worthy of attention .
Let us enumerate the @-@ benefits : ( 1 ) Simple operation and ( 2 ) no waste of capital ,
As we all know , the urgent task today is to spread culture , and just the few schools alone are not enough to do so .
Therefore , to expand the business of the bookstore and set up branches in the counties , we hope that our comrades who are able will help us with larger funds .
( We plan to raise 3,000 yuan of public capital within 2 years ) .
We don &apos;t know who are willing to help us .
Naturally , we cannot ask everyone .
Only by making public our business condition will those sympathetic to us step forward voluntarily and render aid .
Fifth , we have , up till now , been selling books only , without doing any publishing .
Now we plan to organize an &quot; editing and translating department &quot; and a &quot; printing press , &quot; coordinated with the bookstore &apos;s &quot; distribution . &quot; Then , our bookstore will have its independent publications .
As the business will be further expanded , we will have to enlist more comrades and raise more funds ( 3,000 yuan for the editing and translating department and 5,000 yuan for the printing press ) .
Therefore , we have to make public tfhe ( business condition of the bookstore in order to win the sympathy and attention of everyone .
The final point concerns the handling of business by our staff members .
This is the sixth point .
To make the business prosperous , the accounts must be clear .
In regard to our accounts , we have daily , monthly , and half @-@ yearly reckonings .
In daily reckoning , the business figures of the day are totaled every evening .
In monthly reckoning , the business figures of the entire month are totaled on the first of the following month .
The results of the previous 6 months are settled in the half @-@ yearly reckoning .
The &quot; business condition &quot; in the report is the result of the &quot; first half @-@ yearly reckoning . &quot; By so doing , the procedure is followed and the concept clear , and it will be easy to correct the errors and formulate new plans .
Ill
What was covered in report No 1 will not be repeated .
Since our meeting on 1 August last year at Ch &apos;u @-@ i Elementary School , our signing of the lease of
a part of the Hsiang @-@ ya Medical School buildings on Ch &apos;ao @-@ tsung Street on 20 August , the start of business on 9 September , and the first council meeting on 22 October , the events of the bookstore worthy of recording are briefly as follows :
Special council meeting , 29 December : The meeting was attended by Ho Shou @-@ ch &apos;ien , Wang Chi @-@ fan , Chou Tun @-@ yuan , Kuo T &apos;ao @-@ seng , P &apos;eng Yin @-@ po , Hsiung Chin @-@ ting , Chao Yun @-@ wen , Liu Yu @-@ chieh , and Mao Jun @-@ chin , and the problems of &quot; finding another location &quot; and &quot; raising additional funds &quot; were discussed .
The problem of location was discussed first .
As the current location was stuck in a corner of Tsrao @-@ chTao @-@ men and the space inadequate , for the purpose of developing business , it was decided that the bookstore must be moved to a more centralized location with more space .
However , caution was required , and we wanted to move once and for all only .
Before finding an appropriate spot and making definite arrangements , we would remain where we were .
As the day before the meeting Ch ? uan @-@ shan Academy promised to loan a part of its buildings to the bookstore , everyone felt it would be a good move .
However , there must be a clear contract , in accordance with the goal of &quot; safe progress . &quot; It was finally decided that the bookstore would negotiate further with Ch &apos;uan @-@ shan .
The next problem was funds .
The first council meeting decided that 1,000 yuan should be raised this year , and we were still 530 yuan short .
Everyone felt that it was not practical to raise money piecemeal .
XXX volunteered to raise the 530 yuan by himself .
The meeting was adjourned .
Contracts with the Commercial .
Press and other bookstores : These happened after January this year .
Prior to that , we had contracted to market publications with out @-@ of @-@ town bookstores such as Chung @-@ nua , Ya @-@ tung , T &apos;ai @-@ tung , New Youth Press , Peking University Publication Department , and the Academic Lecture Association .
By January this year , we entered an agreement with the Shanghai Commercial Press through Yang Tuan @-@ liu to distribute its publications at 10 , 20 , and 30 percent discounts .
In February , we succeeded in our negotiations to market for the Shanghai Evans Publishing House , but it handles mostly Western language books and very few Chinese books .
Hunan did not need much Western language books ; therefore , we could not sell much .
In March , Hsin @-@ chih Bookstore was formed in Peking , which was a new bookstore with roughly the same policy as Wen @-@ hua Bookstore .
It discussed distribution with us , and we promised to do so .
Hua @-@ yang Books and Newspaper Circulation Office asked us to market its remaining stock of books in Szechwan , and the Asia Civilization Association in Peking entrusted us with its &quot; Current Affairs Monthly , &quot; a new publication since its reorganization , and we promised both of them .
In addition , many new magazine publishers negotiated with us to serve as their distributors during this period .
Marketing of publications : We sold over 160 kinds of books , over 40 kinds of magazines , and 3 newspapers .
Since * &apos; the start of business last year to the end of March this year , besides the 1 @-@ month winter vacation , business was good .
The demand always exceeded the supply .
On the one hand ,
as our store was short of capital and could not buy in large quantities from outside areas , the small quantities were exhausted upon their arrival .
On the other hand , it was the sudden , upsurge of demand for new publications by society , resulting from the positive stimulation of the new thinking and the negative stimulation of the old thinking .
A sudden rise of interest made the public buy all they could .
It was an encouraging situation .
While most of the customers belonged to the academic world , many pamphlets of the &quot; labor field &quot; were sold to the laborers .
Age @-@ wise , naturally most of the customers were young people , and the middle @-@ aged adults came next .

INAUGURAL STATEMENT OF TSU @-@ HSIU UNIVERSITY , HUNAN August 1921
&#91; Text &#93; The Hunanese have recently inaugurated Self @-@ Study University whose approach is to assume the form of the seminary of old , but adopt a study program of modern school .
It expects all students to study by themselves and do research together .
In China today when &quot; university mania &quot; seems to be the order of the day , this is probably the most practical educational institution .
It has recently issued a statement setting forth its inaugural purposes :
Man cannot but study .
To study requires a place and an organization .
Formerly , the place for study was the seminary .
When the school is introduced upon the abolition of the seminary , people vie to criticize the latter and praise the former .
In fact , both have merits and demerits .
The demerits of the seminary lie in the emptiness of its program on how to write &quot; eight @-@ legged &quot; literature for acquiring positions in government .
As such literature is a mere passtime , how can it be called real learning ?
From this point of view , we can say the seminary is empty .
But it also ha.s its merits , If we want to find such merits , we must first know the demerits of school .
The school indeed has many virtues , but it also has many weaknesses .
Its first weakness is lack of affection between instructors and students .
The instructor aims at salary and the student aims at a diploma .
After they have made their deal , they return to where they come from .
What they call &quot; teaching &quot; and &quot; learning &quot; are but commercial transactions .
Its second weakness is to waste the student &apos;s precious time by using stereotyped pedagogical and administrative methods , Man1s intelligence , talent and comprehension vary , but the school , neglecting these differences , tries to cram the same material into the student &apos;s mind .
To respect human dignity , nobody should be &quot; administered &quot; by others .
Yet the school , taking advantage of the residual power of the totalitarian emperor , looks down upon the personality of the student and openly &quot; administers &quot; the student .
Since there is the stereotyped professor , the student loses his integral human nature ; since there is the mechanical &quot; administration , &quot; the student loses his integral personality .
This is the biggest defect of the school which should not be neglected by educators .
Its third weakness is heavy curricula
with a great variety of courses .
The student has to attend classes all day long and knows nothing else .
He often becomes puzzled and can hardly use his mind to initiate his own research .
To sum up , although it cannot be said that all schools have these defects , that they cannot be corrected , and that there is no room for future improvement , this picture is generally true .
It cannot be whitewashed if one wants to .
The root cause lies in the passiveness of the student .
His character has been eroded , his wisdom obliterated , and he is to sink or swim cowardly with the rest of the world .
Even the talented will not take the initiative .
Now look at the seminary .
Although it has defects in form , it has none of the aforementioned weaknesses In the first place , there is profound affection between instructors and students ; secondly , there is no &quot; administration &quot; by professors but free research for exchange of ideas ; thirdly ^ the curricula are concise and research thorough and there is plenty of time for acquiring research findings .
From the viewpoint of &quot; research form , &quot; the seminary far excels the school .
But the modern school has one strong point , that is , it either has a &quot; research program &quot; based on science or uses scientific methods to study philosophy or literature .
The seminary lags behind the school in this regard .
The reason the Self @-@ Study University becomes a new institution lies in that it assumes the form of the seminary of old but adopts the program of the modern school and that it is a special organisation that suits the human nature and facilitates research .
The above shows that both the seminary and school have merits and demerits .
The Self @-@ Study University will retain the virtues and reject the weaknesses .
Now let us talk about the exclusive merits of the Self @-@ Study University which happen to be the demerits of the seminary and school : popularism and anti @-@ popularism .
Both literary academy and government university have strict requirements .
Those who are unable to meet these requirements are , of course rejected .
Even those who can normally , meet these requirements but fail to do so in a particular case , that is , those who have the talent but fail to pass the entrance examination are turned down and thus barred from pursuing their advanced studies .
It is a great pity that , at the moment , many promising young people are deprived of the opportunity to attend school .
This is the first point I wish to make .
Both the seminary and government sponsored university treat learning as such a secret that only a few people with special privileges can attend school ; the majority of common people could not share the opportunity .
Thus learning became the monopoly of a few &quot; academic lords &quot; and was kept at a farther and farther distance from the common people .
It was finally turned into a weird instrument for the intelligentsia to control the common people .
The above is the second point I wish to make .
Poor people cannot enter the seminary .
Only rich people can enter the university .
To get a diploma from a government sponsored university requires somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 yuan .
For poor people to enter a government sponsored university is as difficult as it is &quot; for a wildcat to eat swan &apos;s meat . &quot; The above is the third point .
The Self @-@ Study University will correct these defects .
First , except for resident students upon whom certain limitations have to be imposed concerning housing arrangements , others who are interested in learning may be admitted .
Second , it regards learning as something analogous to tea or meals which can be taken whenever people feel thirsty or hungry .
The secrecy of learning is thus torn down .
Learning is now made available to all and everybody can have his share .
Third , although in the present era when &quot; money is life , &quot; the Self @-@ Study University cannot yet provide everybody of the proletariat with an opportunity to pursue advanced studies , it is moving toward the goal that &quot; learning does not necessarily require a great deal of money . &quot; Students of the Self @-@ Study University may study in school , at home , in various shops groups or agencies .
It is more convenient than government sponsored universities and therefore less expensive .
As I have already mentioned , the Self @-@ Study University is a sort of popular university , then what is its program ?
first , the main approach of the students of the Self @-@ Study University is &quot; to study and think by oneself . &quot; The &quot; library &quot; at the university is designed for this purpose .
Second , the students at the university , aside from studying and thinking by themselves , &quot; discuss and do research together . &quot; The organization of various research societies is designed for this purpose .
Third , the Self @-@ Study University does not require instructors to cram everything into the student &apos;s mind as if forcing food down the student &apos;s throat .
However , it needs those who can help guide the students in doing their research .
Fourth , the Self @-@ Study University is based on course study .
The students may take one or more courses .
The time and scope of each course vary with the wish and level of the student .
Fifth , students at the Self @-@ Study University should not only study but also be ambitious .
They are encouraged to cultivate a good personality , discard bad habits and prepare to reform the society .
Finally , we will talk about the necessity of establishing the Self @-@ Study University in Hunan .
Gentlemen !
Isn &apos;t it that as of today there has been no institution of higher learning in Hunan ?
It is well known that there is no possibility for the establishment of a provincial university in the near future .
Even if there is , it will be a government sponsored university .
Then how to demonstrate or disseminate the spiritual urge and cultural impulse of the 30 million Hunanese who live along the valleys of the Hsiang , Yuan Tzu , and Li rivers ?
Although the Hunanese are as active as the rising sun and very promising , what will become of them if their spiritual desires and cultural impulse cannot be satisfied ?
At this point , we feel the Hunanese have a big mission to accomplish .
What is the mission ?
It is to form , develop and mold their individual as well as their group character and personality .
This has been the very raison d &apos;etre for the inception of the Self @-@ Study University .
Although it is , in fact , not possible to link the university to every Hunanese , it should , in spirit , become a public institution of learning for the whole Hunanese society .
Although it is difficult to ensure good results , we are sure that with our unswerving efforts we will some day attain our goals as time rolls by .
The university now has two divisions : letters and laws .
Courses of letters include : Chinese literature , Western literature , English , logic , psychology ,
ethics , education , sociology , history , geography , journalism and philosophy3 etc .
Courses of laws include : laws , politics and economics , etc .
The above are listed in the organic framework of the university .
It is released simultaneously with this statement .

INAUGURAL STATEMENT OF &apos; HSIN @-@ SHIH @-@ TAI &apos; 10 April 1923
&#91; Text &#93; This journal , founded by colleagues of the Hunan Self @-@ Study University . , can be taken as an organ to publish findings of their research .
This journal is different from other school journals which accept all sorts of articles as if they were &quot; groceries of words . &quot; This journal has certain principles and purposes .
We all have an independent and enterprising spirit and unswerving determination .
In view of the bad social system and inadequate educational institutions we pool our efforts to organize and establish this &quot; fugitive state of learning , &quot; to try to acquire practical knowledge , and to prepare to carry out social reforms .
At the initial stage of Self @-@ Study University , the value of our ideals has to be tested and the results are not yet known .
However , we believe our goals are correct .
Based on this spirit and determination , there is ample chance for success .
This journal can be a yardstick for experimentation .
The inception of this journal is of great significance .
It is expected that this journal will make a thorough study and present concrete suggestions to those issues such as how to reform the government , how to clean up political practices , how to topple imperialism , how to overthrow the warlords , how to renovate educational institutions and how to revolutionize and renovate arts , literature and other branches of learning .
It is our sincere and earnest hope that this journal will urge those who have the same ideals to study and implement these social reforms .

PEKING COUP D &apos; ETAT AND MERCHANTS 11 July 1923
&#91; Text &#93; This coup d &apos;etat suddenly aroused the political interest of the merchants who used to be apathetic to politics .
What happy news : The General Federation of Business Circles of All Streets in Shanghai issued a declaration on 14 June urging the convocation of a national assembly to solve national issues .
The General Chamber of Commerce , in accordance with a resolution adopted by a plenary session , made a declaration on 23 June which read in.part :
&quot; It is hereby solemnly declared that from the fourteenth of this month , our nationals will refuse to recognize that the internal and external activities of Tsao K &apos;un &#91; 2580 6924 &#93; , Kao Ling @-@ wei &#91; 7559 0407 5588 &#93; and others who seized government power illegally represent the nation .
Aside from sending telegrams to military and civil leaders in all provinces , urging them to maintain law and order under their jurisdiction to maintain the status quo , it is hereby requested that all matters pertaining to rehabilitation and reconstruction be solved in consultation with the people of the whole nation . &quot;
Meanwhile , the General Chamber of Commerce resolved not to recognize the National Assembly which &quot; cannot represent the people . &quot; It created a Rule @-@ by @-@ People Committee as an organization to actively solve national issues .
This move by the General Federation of Business Circles of All Streets in Shanghai and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce constitutes the first step of merchants to participate in political activities and a manifestation of the potential of merchants as can be explained in a Chinese saying : &quot; their shout , after 3 years of silence , surprises all . &quot;
The current political issue in China is none other than the single question of national revolution : to topple , by our own efforts , the warlords and foreign imperialists which colluded with warlords .
This is the historical mission of the Chinese nationals which should be borne by the whole people : Merchants , workers , peasants , students and faculty and staff should all come forward and share part of the revolutionary work .
Due to historical
inevitability and current circumstances , the role of merchants in national revolution is more urgent and important than that of others .
As we know , semi @-@ colonial China is under the dual political pressure of warlords and foreign imperialists who colluded with each other to suppress the people of the whole nation .
Under such dual pressure , the whole nation has suffered a great deal .
It is , however , the merchants who are most sensitive to such pressure and suffer the most .
It is well known that &quot; likin &quot; and tariffs are two vital items to merchants .
Their urgent requests are to abolish the likin and increase the tariff both of which are closely related to their interests .
But they are difficult to accomplish because abolition of likin impairs the interests of warlords and increase of tariffs impairs the interests of foreign imperialists .
If likin is abolished , warlords will wither while merchants will prosper .
At that time , merchants can overthrow warlords merely by &quot; issuing a call . &quot; This is tantamount to lifting a stone just to hit one &apos;s own feet .
Clever warlords will not do this .
If tariffs on foreign goods are increased , or the tariff agreement is abolished so as to let China work out protective tariffs at will , the shackles on Chinese merchants will be removed .
Then the development of domestic industry and commerce will be accelerated in no time and foreign goods will loose their footholds in China .
Cunning foreign imperialists will not do this .
Therefore , abolition of likin and increase of tariffs are matters of a life @-@ and @-@ death nature to foreign imperialists and omestic warlords .
This cannot be done by a funny directive by Li Yuan @-@ hung &#91; 7812 0337 3163 &#93; at his inauguration .
Take another example .
The textile merchants in Shanghai recently requested the government to issue textile bonds which were undermined by Tsao Jui &#91; 2580 6904 &#93; and Chin Yun @-@ peng &#91; 7246 7189 7720 &#93; , Their request for a government ban on exporting cotton was frustrated by the foreign minister corps .
This further proves that foreign imperialists and warlords cannot coexist with merchants .
These frustrations were personally experienced by such influential merchants as Mu Ou @-@ chai &#91; 4476 5665 7872 &#93; and others who attended the plenary meeting of Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce on the 23rd of last month .
Merchants always &quot; love peace . &quot; They do not realize that political reforms need revolution and that these reforms cannot be accomplished by a few telegrams concerning &quot; disarmament , constitution and financing . &quot; Nor do they realize that the real strength of revolution can be mustered only by personal participation , organizing the whole nation and launching a mass movement .
They even had the thought that political reforms did not need a political party and considered the revolutionary efforts made by the Kuomintang were unnecessary .
If we compare the current situation with their childish and timid mentality in the past , couldn &apos;t we help laughing ?
In the past , some merchants who had blind faith in the United States held that the United States was a good friend of China ; but they did not realize that it was the first @-@ rate executioner .
Let us examine a few examples to show why those who had blind faith in the United States are wrong : The United States secretly helped Tsao Kun , who are opposed by both merchants and the whole nation , to seize political power ; it did its utmost to foil
the cotton export ban requested by merchants .
From the activities taken by Shanghai merchants in the coup we may find that their attitude has changed .
They have made great progress ; abandoning a peaceful approach adopting revolutionary methods and having the courage to participate in national affairs .
As for their hatred for the U.S.
scheme to make inroads in China , the notorious label of &quot; Chinese merchants are xenophiles &quot; can at least be partly erased by the following telegram sent by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and Bankers Federation to the American Chamber of Commerce and the Association of Overseas Americans accusing the latter of &quot; taking advantage of our sruggle for rule @-@ by @-@ people movement to intimate that the best policy is for China to be placed under international control , fraudulously asserting that they have obtained the consent of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and banking circles in making such a proposal to the government . &quot;
The merchants in Shanghai have stood up and taken action .
We hope that merchants elsewhere will also stand up and take action in unison .
It is urgent as fire burning near eyebrows which does not allow us to lie idly on the bed .
Now it is high time to unite the whole nation to carry out revolution and not to allow &quot; merchants to have factions .
It must be made clear that foreign imperialists and warlords are the common enemies of merchants as well as the whole nation , and that the results of a successful revolution will be our common benefits .
It is most necessary to unite and struggle against common enemies and for common benefits .
We hope the merchants in Tientsin and Peking will not be taken in by Tsao Jui and .
other &quot; bureaucratic capitalists , &quot; and the merchants in Hankow will not capitulate to Wu Pei @-@ fu .
They will rise and join the merchants in Shanghai to take joint revolutionary action .
The more the merchants unite , the stronger they will be ; the greater their role in leading the nation , the more chances for the revolution to succeed .
Finally , we must warn the merchants : First , revolution is not an easy task .
It proves more difficult in China which has been under the dual pressure of foreign imperialists and warlords .
The only way for the revolution to succeed is to call upon merchants , workers , peasants , students , faculty and staff and all oppressed people to establish a united front .
Meanwhile , we must implement the declaration of General Chamber of Commerce to solve national issues &quot; in conjunction with the whole nation &quot; and not to fall into the rut of Federation of Teachers and Merchants which rejected the participation of workers .
Second , now that merchants have taken the first step toward revolution , they must take the second step immediately .
They must insist on convening a national assembly for solving national issues .
They must move forward in unison until their goal is attained .
They should not stop whenever there is an obstacle or move along the erroneous road of colluding with foreign imperialists and warlords .
We must have the conviction that national revolution is the only way to save ourselves as well as our nation .
Many instances in history can be our reference or guide .
Our situation urges us to carry out the historical mission .
We should not relax
our efforts &apos; .
We must use revolutionary methods to open up a new era and create a new nation1 .
We should never forget this is the historical mission of the Chinese nation1 .

&#91; Text &#93; &quot; ... Since the outbreak of the West Hunan issue , Chao &apos;s position has become precarious and cannot but use the Sheng Hsien ( Provincial Constitution ) as a shield to protect himself .
Several days ago , he ordered his cohorts Fang Ko @-@ kang &#91; 2455 0344 0474 &#93; and Li Chi @-@ min &#91; 2621 3444 3046 &#93; and others to use cash bribery to buy over civic organizations or to launch a mass campaign , .. attempting to support Chao by means of Provincial Constitution . , ..
A parade has been scheduled at 8 am on the fifth . , , .
Most of their letters were sent to workers organizations .
They assumed that as workers are simple @-@ minded , more than 1,000 would come .
But up to 10 am , not a single workers body showed up .
Highly disturbed , they sent out people all over : to Chinese Workers Union , Care and Relief Association , Buddhist Speakers Group , etc . , which were dominated by the bandits .
Each person was given half a yuan and a snack .
More than 100 were hired .
The parade started at noon .
Before the parade was begun , between 120 and 130 monks and beggars held a meeting in front of the slide showing room of the Association of Education .
( 2 ) The parade immediately followed the meeting .
Two large flags in the frontone bearing the words &quot; The Association to Protect the Provincial Constitution &quot; and the other , &apos; Provincial Citizens Petition Rally , 1
The First DetachmentAbout 20 or 30 people wearing robes and jackets , pretending to be representatives of citizens of the province ;
The Second DetachmentAbout five or six people representing the Chinese Workers Union ;
The Third Detachment--About 40 or 50 people representing the Buddhist Speakers Group with bald heads and wearing Buddhist robes ;
The Fourth Detachment--About 40 people representing the Care and Relief Association ;
We have been opposing the Confederation of Provincial Self @-@ Government because it is not as what the name suggests but a confederation of military governors who desire to control their separate domains in that name .
We have been opposing the phoney Provincial Constitution manipulated by warlords and dirty politicians because it cannot protect the people but serve as a pretext for power struggles among warlords and dirty politicians .
Hunan serves as a good example .
Chao Heng @-@ t &apos;i &#91; 6392 1854 1912 &#93; now unashamedly launched a &quot; crusade to protect Provincial Constitution . &quot; But for the last two yearssince the establishment of Provincial Constitution @-@ he coldbloodedly murdered the workers ( Huang Lung &#91; 7806 1690 &#93; and others ) , clamped down on newspapers ( TA @-@ KUNG @-@ PAO , CHIH @-@ CHIH HSIN @-@ PAO , HSIN @-@ HSIANG @-@ PAO ) , deprived the people of freedom of correspondence ( postal and telegram censorship has never ceased for a single day ) , deprived the people of freedom of assembly and association ( shut down Ricksha Pullers Union , Rice Millers Union , Association To Back Up the Nation &apos;s Foreign Policy , and repeatedly banned students and workers meetings ) , protected the planting and peddling of opium by his troops , bought votes through bribery ( sent subordinates to stuff voting boxes with false ballots in the general ballot on Provincial Constitution and used cash bribery to create the new Provincial Assembly and a provincial governor ) , extorted contributions from the merchants ( president of the Changsha General Chamber of Commerce was forced to flee ) , collected land rentals from the peasants in advance ( some up to 1928 ) , upset the legal budget proportion by reducing the educational portion and increasing the military portion ) , and colluded with Wu Pei @-@ fu and Hsiao Yao @-@ nan &#91; 5618 5609 0589 &#93; .
All these show that Chao , who used Provincial Constitution as a mask , is in fact a public enemy of the people .
The real purpose for him to hold rallies and conduct campaigns this time steins from his fight for the opium tax ( the so @-@ called special tax ) with Tsai Chu @-@ yu &#91; 5591 6880 3731 &#93; .
The Hunanese cannot but feel ashamed to allow such a diabolical criminal as Chao Heng @-@ t &apos;i to harp on &quot; protecting Constitution &quot; under false pretext .

THE BRITISH AND LIANG JU @-@ HAO 29 August 1923
&#91; Text &#93; We are now forced to sign an agreement on the Wei @-@ hai @-@ wei negotiations .
The whole nation , except the people in Shantung , has not raised any protest .
What is the reason ?
Is it that the nation is too preoccupied in the campaign for retroceding Port Arthur and Dairen and forgets the drive for returning Wei @-@ hai @-@ wei ?
Or that the nation knows to hate only Japan but not England , only that Japanese imperialists are making inroads in China but not that the inroads made by British imperialists are far more severe than those made by Japanese imperialists .
The draft agreement concluded by Liang Ju @-@ hao and the British consists of two parts and 23 articles .
On 23 August the National Assembly in Tsinan pointed out its salient terms that impair national interests as follows :
( 1 ) Substitute Leasing for ceding--The draft agreement allows England to continue the lease for 10 years .
It may extend the lease at the end of 10 years .
In addition , the lease adds to the new lease the city of Wei @-@ hai @-@ wei which has never been leased to England and is now designated as a special area .
( 2 ) Impairs territorial land and territorial watersThe draft agreement stipulates : ( a ) The local authority of China should grant original British lease holders licenses of &quot; permanent lease &quot; ; ( b ) no handling fees should be charged in accordance with the common practice by foreigners who hold permanent leases ; and ( c ) China should not use the official land reserved for England ; China should recognize the land leased by England .
This reveals how much territorial rights has been yielded .
The draft agreement further stipulates : ( a ) China may use the anchorage in the Liu @-@ kung @-@ tao waters only when the British navy is not using it ; ( b ) the British navy may send marines to Liu @-@ kung @-@ tao and practice drills and marksmanship ; and ( c ) The British navy may practice drills in the outer harbor of the anchorage of Liu @-@ kung @-@ tao .
According to the provisions , England is to occupy Liu @-@ kung @-@ tao and the adjacent waters and its marine and naval detachments may enter and leave our territorial land and waters at will .
( 3 ) Gives away national sovereigntyThe draft agreement stipulates that the area between Liu @-@ kung @-@ tao and Wei @-@ hai @-@ wei be designated as a specail area .
It should belong to neither Shantung authority nor the Central Government .
Our government may nominally appoint administrative officials , but the police is directed by the British , finance controlled by the Customs Inspectorate ( British ) and the city affairs is jointly conducted by a Sino @-@ British Committee composed of Chinese and Englishmen .
The administrative officials appointed by the Chinese Government are but titular ones and their chief responsibilities are to repay the debts to the Englishmen and raise funds for public expenses .
Wei @-@ hai @-@ wei has thus become Hong Kong II .
Our national sovereignty has completely been undermined .
Compatriots having blind faith in the Washington .Conference : What did the Washington Conference do for us ?
Compatriots believing England is better than Japan : In what way is England better than Japan ?
The return of Wei @-@ hai @-@ wei means only to turn it into Hong Kong II .
England wants to renew the lease of its settlements in Hankow and Tientsin upon the expiration of their present leases ; its request of connecting the Canton @-@ Kowloon Railroad and the Canton @-@ Hankow Railroad is to put the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and southwest provinces under the economic aggression of Hong Kong .
The tariff agreement is limited to discussing the likin issue only ( 26 August London dispatch ) .
They have recently removed their masks to suggest joint administration of the railroads .
Compatriots having blind faith in the Washington Conference and believing England is better than Japan : What did the Washington Conference do for us ?
In what way is England better than .
Japan ?
The nation should rise immediately to oppose the pirate @-@ like British who have exposed their aggressive intention :
The nation should rise immediately to oppose traitor Liang Ju @-@ hao&apos;

CIGARETTE TAX 29 August 1923
&#91; Text &#93; We often say : The Chinese government is the bookkeeper of foreigners .
Some people may doubt it .
Do we often say : Foreigners ( especially the British and Americans ) try to squeeze more Chinese blood in the name of &quot; goodwill &quot; ?
Some people tnay also doubt it .
Since the lifting of the cotton export ban due to objection by foreigners , some people have begun to believe there is some truth in it .
Now that foreigners are pressing the government to abolish the cigarette tax in Chekiang and other provinces , they have begun to believe there is more and more truth in it .
According to a 29 August dispatch from Peking in the SHEN PAD &#91; 3947 1032 &#93; which read : &quot; The Cabinet has , as a result of the protest by British and American ministers , resolved to order all provinces to stop collecting the cigarette tax . &quot; What is the cigarette tax ?
Please read the 30 June telegram sent by the General Chamber of Commerce in Hangchow to the Peking government :
&quot; It is a common practice for governments to levy taxes on luxury items .
In recent years , cigarettes have had a field day .
For Chekiang Province alone , the annual sales volume exceeds 10 million yuan .
The consumption volume is shocking and the poisonous effects are as detrimental as opium .
The authorities have therefore established bureaus to collect the cigarette tax , trying to use revenues from this wasteful item for repairing roads .
It is learned that foreigners , under the pretexts of treaty rights , have made repeated protests with the government against this tax .
It should be pointed out that this special tax , imposed exclusively on the smokers . , has nothing to do with the cigarette merchants .
This is the tax paid exclusively by people in Chekiang , foreigners should not interfere with it .
Moreover , it is purely a domestic matter , and foreigners should not interfere .
The government is urged to present all possible justifications and allow no pretexts so as to protect our sovereign rights . &quot;
It is thus clear that the British and Americans , taking advantage of tariff agreements , are trying to force China not to levy taxes freely on imported luxury items .
They disregard whether it is &quot; the tax purely paid by people in Chekiang &quot; or it is &quot; purely domestic matter . &quot; They insist that no tax should be imposed on imported goods .
Of the cigarettes produced by British and American companies , a small portion is imported from England , the United States and Japan , the greater portion is manufactured in factories in inland China in such cities as Shanghai and &apos;Hankow , using Chinese tobacco leaves and Chinese labor .
After paying a nominal tax in accordance with the terms of the &quot; agreements , &quot; the merchants send the cigarettes in bulk to various provinces , not allowing China to levy taxes &quot; freely . &quot; The annual cigarette sales volume in Chekiang Province alone exceeds 10 million yuan .
Based on this figure , the total annual cigarette sales volume in the whole nation should at least exceed 200 million yuan .
It is really &quot; shocking . &quot; Let the 400 million compatriots think it over : What is the real purpose behind the &quot; goodwill &quot; of foreigners ?
The &quot; Cabinet meeting &quot; of the Chinese government is really quick in yielding .
Even the fart of foreigners can be taken as &quot; fragrance . &quot; The Cabinet meeting lifts the cotton export ban because foreigners want cotton ; it orders &quot; all provinces to stop collecting the cigarette tax &quot; because foreigners want to import cigarettes .
Let the 400 million compatriots again think it over : Isn &apos;t it correct to say that the Chinese government is the bookkeeper of foreigners ?

KUOMINTANG CENTRAL COMMITTEE REFUTES KUOMINTANG MEMBERS FOR CONVENING ILLEGAL MEETING IN PEKING
27 November 1923
&#91; Text &#93; Telegram to Kuomintang Headquarters of All Levels
Members of Kucunintang Headquarters of All Levels : Upon receiving the 16 November telegram from Lin Sen &#91; 2651 2773 &#93; and other members of the Central Executive Committee in Peking urging the convocation of the Fourth CEC Plenary Session at the Western Hills , the Central Executive Committee strongly refuted the move .
From a legal point of view , since the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee resolved that the National Congress and the CEC Plenary Session be convened in Canton , nobody should violate the resolution .
From a practical viewpoint , if the CEC Plenary Session , which is intended to be a public meeting , should be held in Peking , it would be under the pressure of imperialists externally and obstruction of reactionaries through the warlords internally .
This was the reason for the participants in the Third CEC Plenary Session , held in Peking in April , to stop the meeting mid @-@ way and move southward and continue to meet in Canton .
Whenever we plan for the future , this bitter experience should be remembered .
How could the Fourth CEC Plenary Session fall into the same rut and let warlords and reactionaries attain their scheme of undermining the revolution ?
Moreover , the Second National Congress was originally scheduled for 15 August in Canton , it was repeatedly postponed because of strikes in Kwangtung and Hong Kong , transportation difficulties , campaigns against reactionaries in Canton and incessant civil wars .
Now all Kwangtung Province has been unified and Canton is as safe as a rock .
Even if there is still some transportation difficulties , the meeting can be held .
The Central Executive Committee has therefore resolved to call its Fourth Plenary Session on 11 December and the Second National Congress on New Year &apos;s Day of the Fifteenth Year .
It has sent telegrams to Comrade Lin Sen and others , urging them to respect the resolution , take consideration of the circumstances , come to Canton to attend the meeting immediately , not to insist on their deviationist views and stir up trouble .
Aside from sending telegrams to Comrade Hu Han @-@ min &#91; 5170 3352 3046 &#93; who is now in Moscow and Comrades Li Lieh @-@ chun &#91; 2621 3525 6874 &#93; , Po Wen @-@ wei &#91; 2672 2429
5588 &#93; who now serve outside Peking for their concurrence , we wish to express our unanimous support to the resolution adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee and the CEC &apos;s latest stand and will do our utmost to put them into force .
We hereby solemnly make this declaration and solicit your support .

PROPAGANDA OUTLINE FOR KUOMINTANG &apos;S WAR AGAINST FENG @-@ T &apos;IEN 27 November 1925
&#91; Text &#93; In view of the fact that the &apos;war against Feng @-@ t &apos;ien is a momentous matter , that it forms a part of the national revolutionary movement against British and Japanese imperialism , and that party units of all levels in all areas should direct all the comrades to propagandize extensively so that the people of the entire nation will understand the reason and the goal of the war , the Propaganda Department of the Chinese Kuomintang Central Executive Committee has formulated a propaganda outline , analyzing the various aspects of the war , presenting an outline of propaganda , and listing nine slogans .
This outline was submitted by Department Chief Mao Tse @-@ tung , and passed at the meeting of the Central Committee on 27 November .
The full text is as follows :
( A ) Analysis of the War Against Feng @-@ t &apos;ien
( 1 ) In regard to imperialism : The war between Chih @-@ li and Feng @-@ t &apos;ien last year was an attempt of British and American imperialism to support the Chih @-@ li faction to unite China and oust Japanese imperialism .
It was ignited by the Kiangsu @-@ Chekiang war , because American imperialism wished to monopolize Kiangsu &apos;s wireless telegram loan and expel Japan &apos;s loan .
Therefore , at that time , America and the pro @-@ America faction did their utmost to help Ch &apos;i Hsieh @-@ yuan &#91; 7871 3610 0337 &#93; while Japan and the pro @-@ Japan faction supported Lu Yung @-@ hsiang &#91; 4151 3057 4382 &#93; , The war against Feng @-@ t &apos;ien this time is along the same line .
Japanese imperialism stands behind the Feng @-@ t &apos;ien faction while American imperialism backs the Chih @-@ li faction , As for British imperialism , seeing the incompetence of the Chih @-@ li faction in the Feng @-@ t1ien @-@ Chih @-@ li war last year , when the nationwide anti @-@ British 30 May Movement broke out , British imperialism compromised with Japan and induced Chang Tso @-@ lin &#91; 1728 0155 7207 &#93; , by means of generous rewards , to suppress the anti @-@ British movement in Shanghai .
It was subsequently rumored that Britain supplied large sums of money to Feng @-@ t &apos;ien to expand the Feng @-@ t &apos;ien Arsenal in order to enable the Feng @-@ t &apos;ien faction to unite China .
Feeling that Shanghai &apos;s military reinforcement handled by Yang Yu @-@ t &apos;ing
&#91; 2799 1342 7200 &#93; and the customs conference held in Peking were favorable to Chang of Feng @-@ t &apos;ien3 the Chih @-@ li faction started trouble on an early date .
Whether the cunning British imperialism is on the side of Feng @-@ t &apos;ien or Chih @-@ li in the war this time cannot be clarified completely at this time .
Probably Japan , for the purpose of resisting America , would rather associate with Britain and jointly make use of Chang Tso @-@ lin .
However , if Britain should detect any unfavorable situation on the part of Chang Tso @-@ lin and the possibility of victory on the part of its old servant Wu P &apos;ei @-@ fu &#91; 0702 0160 1318 &#93; , it may , for the purpose of consolidating its power sphere along the Yangtze valley , abandon its new love for its old flame .
It is something which will not be surprising .
One can see that British imperialism will back the side which appears to be more certain of victory .
( 2 ) In regard to the warlords : In the confrontation between Chih @-@ li and Feng @-@ t &apos;ien ) the Chih @-@ li faction controls Hunan , Hupeh , Kiangsi , Anhwei , Kiangsu , Chekiang , and Fukien , a total of seven provinces .
Szechwan &apos;s Yuan Tsu @-@ ming &#91; 5913 4371 6900 &#93; and Kweichow , which is under his control , nominally also belong to the Chih @-@ li faction .
However , there are specifi ^ factions inside these several provinces , and Wu P &apos;ei @-@ fu and Sun Ch &apos;uan @-@ fang &#91; 1327 0278 5364 &#93; will inevitably split .
In the critical period of the war against Feng @-@ t &apos;ien , Sun and Wu had to unite and fight .
Now that the war is at a standstill a fissure has appeared .
A split will be inevitable once Chang of Feng @-@ t &apos;ien is defeated .
In the Feng @-@ t &apos;ien faction , there have always been , the old and the young factions .
Since defeating the Chih @-@ li faction last year , their hidden internal struggles have been ever aggravating due to the distribution of rights and privileges .
Their treasury is exhausted , and the Feng @-@ t &apos;ien paper currency has dropped to below 50 percent .
The seizure of Hopeh , Shantung , Kiangsu , and Anhwei was for the purpose of solving the financial problem .
With the loss of Kiangsu and Anhwei , the threat of the Kuorointang army , and the precarious situation of the Peking @-@ Hankow line in Shantung and Hopeh , their financial sources inside Shan @-@ hai @-@ kuan have withered .
When several hundred thousand hungry troops are stationed inside and outside Shan @-@ hai @-@ kuan , the situation requires early war , not perseverance .
Between the Feng @-@ t &apos;ien and Chih @-@ li warlord factions , regardless of which side wins , it will be unfavorable to China , because each has a vicious imperialism backing it .
However , in the nation @-@ wide anti @-@ Feng @-@ t &apos;ien movement , since the Chih @-@ li faction is against the Feng @-@ t &apos;ien faction , it has to be counted as one of us in order to resist the powerful enemy together .
Once Feng @-@ t &apos;ien collapses , it can then be wiped out with the strength of the nation .
This is a necessity in the war strategy .
( 3 ) In regard to political factions : In the war against Feng @-@ t &apos;ien , the noteworthy political factions are the An @-@ fu , Study , Joint Control , and New Diplomacy Factions , and the comprador class in Shanghai and Nan @-@ t &apos;ung .
The military power of the An @-@ fu Faction can be considered as nil at this time .
In regard to its political power , it has long split into the pro @-@ Chih @-@ li and pro @-@ Feng @-@ t &apos;ien factions .
As the pro @-@ Chih @-@ li faction is out of power and the pro @-@ Feng @-@ t &apos;ien faction is in power in Peking , the Peking
government has become something completely representing Chang Tso @-@ lin .
The Study Faction always followed Ts &apos;ao &#91; 2580 &#93; and Wu &#91; 0702 &#93; when they were in power .
Though Ts &apos;ao and Wu have failed , it still remains behind Wu P &apos;ei @-@ fu .
With the triumph of the Chih @-@ li faction , the Study Faction &apos;s Chiang Fang @-@ chen &#91; 5592 2455 7201 &#93; and its members are swarming in Hankow to acquire benefits .
The Joint Control Faction consists of many small political factions . , including the I @-@ yu Society of the Political Studies Faction and the politicians of the so @-@ called Kuomintang Comrades &apos; Club such as Chang Ping @-@ lin &#91; 4545 3521 7792 &#93; , Currently , all its members are gathered under the banner of Wu P &apos;ei @-@ fu and making plans for action .
The Ku Wei @-@ chun &#91; 7357 4850 6874 &#93; faction , which is the so @-@ called New Diplomacy Faction , has always served as the traitorous agent between the Chih @-@ li faction and British and American imperialism * Currently , it is associated with the Study Faction and the comprador class of Shanghai and Nan @-@ t &apos;ung , gathering together under the banner of the Chih @-@ li faction and vigorously pursuing its traitorous activities .
Last year , in the war against Chih @-@ li , the comprador class in Shanghai and Nan @-@ t &apos;ung , under the direction of American imperialism , stood alongside the Chih @-@ li faction .
With the resumption of power by the Chih @-@ li faction , it has immediately followed the intent of its master ( American imperialism ) to serve as a resounding echo of the Chih @-@ li faction and its effective support .
Of the political factions discussed above , besides the An @-@ fu Faction which represents the interests of Japanese imperialism and the bureaucrats and belongs to the Feng @-@ t &apos;ien faction , all the rest , including the Joint Control Faction of the Study Faction representing the interests of the bureaucrats and the landlord class , the New Diplomacy Faction representing the interests of Britain and America , especially America , and the comprador class of Shanghai and Nan @-@ t &apos;ung , stand on the side of the Chih @-@ li faction .
( 4 ) In regard to the National Army : The National Army has no connections with British , American , and Japanese imperialism ; therefore , it is sympathetic to the anti @-@ imperialist movement .
This is its most outstanding characteristic .
Currently , due to the necessity of strategy , it has not split with Chang Tso @-@ lin , Actually , it may even adopt a temporary compromise .
But it is a temporary matter .
If our party wishes to make a long @-@ range substantial progress in the national revolution after the war against Feng @-@ t &apos;ien , the victory of the National Army in the North is one of the important keys .
( 4 ) In regard to the National Government : The foundation of our party in Kwangtung is very stable .
Hsiung K &apos;o @-@ wu &apos;s &#91; 3574 0344 2976 &#93; troops along the Pei River have long been liquidated , and Ch &apos;en Chiung @-@ ming1s &#91; 7115 3518 2494 &#93; troops along the Tung River have been.wiped out .
Forces have been sent after the small contingents sneaking into the Fukien border , eliminating them .
Teng Pen @-@ yin &apos;s &#91; 6772 2609 3009 &#93; men in Nan @-@ lu will soon be eradicated .
The unification of the entire area can be considered completed .
The attempt of British imperialism to destroy our party &apos;s revolutionary force by associating with Ch &apos;en Chiung @-@ ming has failed altogether .
In regard
to the strikes in Canton and Hong Kong , the businessmen and government of Hong Kong know that there is no way to resist and are now doing their best to negotiate .
A successful solution will soon be reached .
The current tasks of our party in Kwangtung are the training and reenforqement of the revolutionary army , the renovation and rectification of civil administration , finance , judicature , and education , and the expansion of the mass movements of workers , peasants , merchants , and students .
In a word , we must actively gather our strength within the shortest possible time , immediately send our troops North when the situation in the North and the South develops to a certain stage , and lead the people of the entire nation for the thorough solution of the affairs of the nation .
In the name of the Central Executive Committee , our party has published a declaration on the current situation and pointed out the goal of war against Feng @-@ t &apos;ien .
We have also , in the name of the National Government Committee , sent telegrams to the top generals of the Chih @-@ li and Feng @-@ t &apos;ien factions , urging them to overthrow Feng @-@ t &apos;ien &apos;s Chang and organize a government and formulate policies compatible with the will of the people , in order to test their reaction to our party &apos;s principle of defending the interests of the people .
( 6 ) In regard to the people : In the understanding of the people , the anti @-@ Feng @-@ t &apos;ien movement this time is a movement against the warlords of the Feng @-@ t &apos;ien faction who support British and Japanese imperialism and suppress the patriotic movement .
Therefore , the main force of the movement against Feng @-@ t &apos;ien should be the revolutionary people of the entire nation .
By initiating the movement , the Chih @-@ li faction only serves as the front @-@ runner , not the main force .
Currently , the wrath of the people against the Feng @-@ t &apos;ien warlords is unprecedented .
Their concept that resisting Feng @-@ t &apos;ien is resisting British and Japanese imperialism and victory over Feng @-@ t &apos;ien is victory over Britain and Japan is the same as that of the people of.Kwangtung that punishing Ch &apos;en Chiung @-@ ming was attacking British imperialism and victory of the eastern expedition was the victory of the strikes .
Therefore , the war against Feng @-@ t &apos;ien , in the understanding of the people , is different from the wars between Hopeh and Anhwei and between Feng @-@ t &apos;ien and Hopeh .
( B ) Our Propaganda and Preparation
The responsible comrades of party units of all levels in all areas must , with organization and .planning , seek all kinds of opportunities to explain to the comrades and propagandize to the people the following points :
( 1 ) They must explain the conspiracies of the imperialists in this war .
( 2 ) They must explain the grave dangers to the people in case of victory of the Feng @-@ t &apos;ien warlords who serve as the running dogs of British and Japanese imperialism .
( 3 ) The people may temporarily utilize the resistance of the Chih @-@ li faction against the Feng @-@ t &apos;ien faction , but they must not permit it to take
the place of the Feng @-@ t &apos;ien faction , because if so , the people will likewise be in grave danger .
The people should not forget the lesson when the Chih @-@ li faction was in power .
Special attention must be given to the propaganda of this point in areas in the Yangtze provinces where Wu P &apos;ei @-@ fu and Sun Ch &apos;uan @-@ fang are popular with the merchant class .
( 4 ) All types of counter @-@ revolutionary factions , such as the An @-@ fu , Study , Joint Control , and New Diplomacy Factions , and the comprador class are absolutely incompatible with the people &apos;s interest .
Their secrets must be exposed and they must all be ousted .
( 5 ) Among the anti @-@ Feng @-@ t &apos;ien forces , the difference between the Feng Yu @-@ hsiang &#91; 7458 3768 4382 &#93; faction and the Wu P &apos;ei @-@ fu and Sun Ch &apos;uan @-@ fang faction is that Feng has no connection with imperialism and he supports the national revolution , while Wu and Sun are under the orders of imperialism and resist the national revolution .
The distinction between friend and foe , as far as the people are concerned , depends on whether there is a relationship with imperialism .
Regardless of who and when , the moment such a relationship arises , the people will not consider him as a friend .
( 6 ) The true leader of the people is the Chinese Nationalist Party ; the true government of the people is the National Government in Canton ; the true army of the people is the National Revolutionary Army in Kwangtung .
The Nationalist Party , the National Government , and the National Revolutionary Army are the vanguard against imperialism , the defenders of the people &apos;s interest , and the comforters of the people in their suffering ( illustrated by Kwangtung &apos;s resistance to British imperialism and its unification and active construction this time ) .
( 7 ) All the oppressed people of China are the ones to decide on all the problems of China .
In the war against Feng @-@ t &apos;ien this time , the people should serve as the commander in chief .
The people must organize and take charge of the great movement against Feng @-@ t &apos;ien .
( 8 ) The four principles in the Nationalist Party &apos;s declaration on the current situation are : 1 .
A united nation @-@ wide national government must be formed .
The national government must , as soon as possible , call a preparatory meeting for a national congress .
The national government must , as soon as possible , call a preparatory meeting for a national congress and find the fundamental solution for the unequal treaties .
The national government must defend the freedom of the people to speak , form associations , and hold meetings .
These four principles are the only way to conclude the war .
If they are not followed , then the situation of joint control by imperialism and the warlords will remain even after the end of the war , and the people will still face the same danger as before .
( 9 ) To implement the principles of the Nationalist Party , a national congress truly representing the people must be prepared as soon as possible .
Among the many kinds of people &apos;s organizations , a renewed and general propaganda of &quot; the necessity of the national congress in solving national affairs &quot; should be promoted as a continuation of last year &apos;s propaganda .
When necessary , the party units of the provinces and special municipalities should , within their jurisdictions , order a general mobilization and vigorously propagandize the national congress , in order to arouse the attention of the people .
( C ) Slogans
( 1 ) Down with Chang Tso @-@ lin and Tuan Ch &apos;i @-@ jui &#91; 3008 4388 3843 &#93; !
( 2 ) Down with British , American , and Japanese imperialism !
( 3 ) Down with all conspiratorial political factions &apos; .
( 4 ) The people must rise and direct the anti @-@ Feng @-@ t1ien movement !
( 5 ) Let the national congress representing the people conclude the war against Feng @-@ t &apos;ienl
( 6 ) Form a united nationwide national government !
( 7 ) Abolish unequal treaties !
( 8 ) Freedom of meeting , association , speech , and strike !
( 9 ) All revolutionary elements must immediately join the Nationalist Party !

REASONS FOR PUBLISHING &apos; CHENG @-@ CHIH CHOU @-@ PAO &apos; 5 December 1925
&#91; Text &#93; Why do we publish &quot; CHENG @-@ CHIH CHOU @-@ PAO &quot; &#91; &quot; Political Weekly &quot; &#93; ?
It is for the revolution .
Why do we want a revolution ?
It is to liberate the nation of China , to realize control by the people , and to gain economic happiness for the people .
For the revolution , we have offended all enemies--imperialism throughout the world , large and small warlords throughout the nation , the comprador class , local tyrants , and evil gentry of all areas , and all the reactionary political factions such as the An @-@ fu , Study , Joint Control , and Nationalist &#91; Kuo @-@ chia Chu @-@ iJ Factions .
These enemies , with the development of our revolutionary force , are reenforcing their oppression and mobilizing all their strength for the purpose of destroying us .
They have foreign and domestic navies , armies and police , large international progaganda machines ( Reuter , etc . ) , national newspapers , and schools .
Though there are frequent conflicts among them due to differences in interest , none of them has a good intent toward us .
After wiping out Yang &#91; 2799 &#93; and Liu &#91; 0491 &#93; and eliminating Cheng &#91; 6774 &#93; and Mo &#91; 5459 &#93; , our work in Kwangtung has reached a new era .
Canton city has realized peace which was unseen in the past 14 years ; the people have truly gained the freedom to hold meetings } form associations , speak , and strike ; there has been no coercive conscription for the eastern expeditionary forces ; gambling has been abolished in Canton &apos;s market ; military affairs and political administration of the entire province have been unified ; financial administration is gradually centralized ; a part of the harsh taxes harassing the people has been abolished , and measures for eliminating the rest have been decided on ; policies of reform have been formulated for the civil affairs , judicial , education , and communication organs ; the counter @-@ revolutionary remnants of Pei River , Tung River , and Nan @-@ lu are gradually eliminated ; strikes and large @-@ scale blockade of Hong Kong are continued to support the patriotic workers &apos; movement .
We do not hide our shortcomings .
We do not claim that Kwangtung has been reformedKwangtung &apos;s reform is just beginning .
There are still many bandits disrupting law and order ; there are
still many local tyrants , evil gentry , and corrupt officials preying on the people ; many behind- the- scene evil practices in the civil affairs , finance , judicial , education , and communication organs have not been eliminated .
We do not say that all the defects no longer exist .
We say that we already have a revolutionary force ; we already have an opportunity to eliminate the bandits ; we already can begin the overhauling of civil affairs , finance , judicial , education , and communications organs .
In sum , we already have a foundation for revolution .
In everything we do , we follow Mr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s strategy , open and clear to the eyes of the public .
Meanwhile , Hong Kong &apos;s British imperialism , the counter @-@ revolutionary remnants such as Ch &apos;en Chiung @-@ mtng &#91; 7115 3518 2494 &#93; and Teng Pen @-@ yin &#91; 6772 2609 3009 &#93; , and the numerous local tyrants , evil gentry , and corrupt officials cannot but tremble .
Angry and indignant , they go to the extreme to curse , slander , and injure us .
The counter @-@ revolutionary propaganda organs in Peking , Tientsin , Shanghai , and Hankow are in ah uproar , and they stop at nothing to curse , slander , and injure us with their evil mouth and poison tongue , The people of the entire nation , especially those in the North and along the Yangtze , are confused by them and completely isolated from the true situation in Kwangtung Suspicions arise even among the comrades .
Even the unsuspicious elements have no factual basis to argue the case .
Such terms as &quot; internal &quot; squabble &quot; and &quot; communism &quot; are spread everywhere , as if Kwangtung had become hell itself .
We can no longer let it go .
We must begin to counter @-@ attack , &quot; Propagandize counter @-@ attack to the counter @-@ revolutionaries in order to break down the counter @-@ revolutionary propaganda . &quot; This is the mission of &quot; Cheng @-@ chih Chou @-@ pao . &quot; . ,
We do not need much argument in our counter @-@ attack of the enemies ; we only need to report truthfully the facts of our revolutionary work .
When the enemies say &quot; Kwangtung has turned communist , &quot; we say &quot; Please look at the facts.11 When they say &quot; Kwangtung is squabbling internally , &quot; we say &quot; Please look at the facts . &quot; When they say &quot; The Canton government associates with Russia , yields power , and disgraces the nation , &quot; we say &quot; Please look at the facts . &quot; When they say &quot; The people under the Canton government live in misery , &quot; we say &quot; Please look at the facts . &quot;
In the structure of &quot; Cheng @-@ chih Chou @-@ pao , &quot; 90 percent are factual reports , and only 10 percent are arguments against the propaganda of the counterrevolutionaries ,
Accept the truthful report of our revolutionary work &apos; .
Arise , revolutionary people of the entire nation 1

THE &apos; THREE @-@ THREE @-@ THREE @-@ ONE SYSTEM &apos; 5 December 1925
&#91; Text &#93; &quot; What is communism ?
Confiscation of property ; no private savings permitted ; the rich and poor are both poor .
A good term is coined .
It is called emphasis on agriculture .
Three @-@ three @-@ three @-@ bne , actually it makes no sense .
Thirty percent to the landlord . , 30 percent confiscated , 30 percent to oneself , and 10 percent for the association . &quot; This is the &quot; anti @-@ communist &quot; announcement in four @-@ word rhymes posted by Yang K &apos;un @-@ ju &#91; 2799 0981 1172 &#93; inside and outside Hui @-@ chou .
A friend of a rather clear mind newly arrived from Peking asked me : &quot; Is there actually such a thing as the &apos; three @-@ three @-@ three @-@ one system &apos; ? &quot; I was surprised .
Before answering him , I thought : &quot; Do you suspect that the Kuomintang is practicing the &apos; three @-@ three @-@ three @-@ one system1 ? &quot; With an ironic expression , I answered : &quot; There is , but not like what Yang K &apos;un @-@ ju described . &quot; He said : &quot; Isn &apos;t the &apos; Hong Kong Morning News &apos; a Kuomintang paper ?
It also published it . &quot; Only then did I learn that the &quot; Hong Kong Morning News &quot; also had such odd ideas .
Before the revolt of Yang and Liu , the paper did have connections with the Kuomintang .
After the revolt of Yang and Liu and the strikes in Canton and Hong Kong , it was bought by Liu Chen @-@ huan &#91; 0491 7201 1403 &#93; to serve as an organ of Hong Kong &apos;s foreign excellencies and the so @-@ called Commander in Chief Ch &apos;en &#91; 7115 &#93; , By talcing advantage of the severance of communication between Canton and Hong Kong , many &quot; facts &quot; have emerged in the pages of the paper on the isolated island of Hong Kong .
&quot; Three @-@ three @-@ three @-@ one &quot; was but one of the many &quot; facts , &quot; yet it was delivered all the way to Peking to feast the eyes of my Peking friend .
I , therefore , thought that , in regard to the things in the world today , whether animate ( such as man ) or inanimate ( such as a newspaper ) , we must not be too rigid in our view , because , as &quot; revolution &quot; and &quot; counter @-@ revolution &quot; had parted company , the animate and inanimate things could belong to one side today and the other side tomorrow .
When the &quot; Hong Kong Morning News &quot; was with the Kuoraintang , it served as the organ paper of the Kuomintang .
When bought by Hong Kong &apos;s foreign excellency Mr Liu Chen @-@ huan and the so @-@ called Commander in Chief Ch &apos;en , it could only become their organ paper .
Precisely like Feng Tzu @-@ yu &#91; 7458 5261 3945 &#93; and Ma Su &#91; 7456 4790 &#93; , when they were with the Kuomintang , they were Kuomintang party members .
Once bought by
Tuan Ch &apos;i @-@ jui &#91; 3008 4388 3843 &#93; , though they still claimed to be members of the Kuomintang and labeled themselves with the &quot; Kuomintang Club , &quot; they were Tuan Ch &apos;i @-@ jui1s men .
I hold no special grudge against the &quot; Hong Kong Horning Newte &quot; or Messrs Feng and Ma ; I only borrow this instance to warn my friends inside and outside the country against being tricked when observing people and things .
As for Yang K &apos;un @-@ ju &apos;s announcement , his composition is fine , except for the phrase &quot; it makes no sense , &quot; which spoiled his pen .
Isn &apos;t it that one pellet of mouse dropping spoils the whole pot of soup ?
But then it was the fault of the secretary .

YANG K &apos;UN @-@ JU &apos;S NOTICE AND LIU CHIH @-@ LU &apos;S CABLE 5 December 1925
&#91; Text &#93; We have already studied Yang K &apos;un @-@ ju &apos;s &#91; 2799 9081 1172 &#93; announcement , but there is Liu Chih @-@ lu &apos;s &#91; 0491 1807 7120 &#93; telegram to &quot; Executive Tuan &#91; 3008 &#93; , Ministers and Vice @-@ Ministers of the Ministries , Commissioner Chang &#91; 1728 &#93; of Feng @-@ t &apos;ien , Governor Chao &#91; 6392 &#93; of Hunan , Commissioner Hsiao &#91; 5618 &#93; of Wu @-@ ch &apos;ang , Superintendent Fang &#91; 2455 &#93; of Kiangsi , Superintendent Chou &#91; 0719 &#93; of Fukien , and Messrs Ts &apos;en Hsi @-@ lin &#91; 1478 6007 2651 &#93; , Wu Tzu @-@ yu &#91; 0702 1311 3768 &#93; , K &apos;ang Nan @-@ hai &#91; 1660 0589 3189 &#93; , and Liang Jen @-@ kung &#91; 2733 0117 0361 &#93; &quot; which is slightly different .
In his &quot; seventh count of the indictment , &quot; he states : &quot; In the society of China , agriculture has always been emphasized .
The interests of the landowner and the tenant are always balanced .
The spirit of mutual help makes them naturally compatible .
Now , the inducement of the land division theory has undermined the mutual benefit . &quot; This statement conflicts with Yang K &apos;un @-@ ju &apos;s announcement .
According to Yang K ! un @-@ ju , &quot; 30 percent to the landlord , 30 percent confiscated , 30 percent to oneself , and 10 percent for the association.11 So everyone gets something , and it can be called &quot; mutual benefit . &quot; Yet Liu Chih @-@ lu says that it is &quot; land division , &quot; indicating that the Canton government tells the peasants to seize the land from the landlords and divide it up , and the landlords will have no rent to collect thereafter .
Therefore , &quot; mutual benefit is undermined . &quot; One says that the landlord still retains 30 percent , while the other says that he will have nothing left .
I wonder whom my friends in Peking and other areas believe .

IF THERE IS COMMON ASPIRATION FOR COMBATING COMMUNISM , THEN MY ENEMY &apos;S ENEMY IS MY GOOD FRIEND

&#91; Text &#93; After enumeration , the eight counts against the National Government , Liu Chih @-@ lu &#91; 0491 1807 7120 &#93; and others , in their telegram , add an &quot; Alasl &quot; paragraph and continue by stating : &quot; In sura , when sending troops to quell rebellions , punish the criminal , and save the people , if there is common aspiration for combating communism , then my enemy &apos;s enemy is my good friend .
An army is strong when its cause is just .
No combat is required to determine the.outcome.

Are they not also comrades with common aspirations to combat communism ?
Yet their titles are not listed .
Furthermore , Governor Chin helped with such large amounts of money and weapons and protected the commanding headquarters set up by Commander in Chief Ch &apos;en &#91; 7115 &#93; in Hong Kong .
His aspirations to combat communism are clear like the sun and the stars , and yet he was left outl One truly cannot understand the intent \ The sentences at the end of the telegram , &quot; an army is strong when its cause is just , &quot; etc . , are even more confusing .
He is actually writing a eulogy to the National Government1 .

ACCLAMATIONS WILL COME FROM ALL NATIONS 5 December 1925
&#91; Text &#93; A Ch &apos;ao @-@ Mei gentry , student , and merchant joint association sent a telegram supporting Liu Chih @-@ lu &#91; 0491 1807 7120 &#93; , stating : &quot; The evil communist party brought calamity to eastern Kwangtung .
Nearby , it can sink China into a hopeless situation ; far away , it can engulf the world and destroy all mankind .
Mr Liu relies on righteousness and steps forward , ahead of the world .
Wherever his banners point , the people will welcome him with broth and food .
Bringing down the rotten and destroying the withered , he will soon establish great merits .
( The reporter finds the word &quot; soon &quot; defective . ) Communization will be eradicated , and the foundation of the nation will be stabilized .
Not only his achievement will rank with the Yunnan Uprising and the Ma @-@ ch &apos;ang Harangue of the Troops , but mankind in the whole world will be safeguarded and the calamity of the entire globe will be averted .
He will be remembered a thousand years ; acclamations will come from all nations . &quot; Everywhere , &quot; the whole world &quot; and &quot; the entire globe &quot; are not forgotten .
How far @-@ reaching is the sight &apos; .
If Liu Chih @-@ lu truly eradicates &quot; communization , &quot; &quot; acclamations &quot; for sure will come .
But whether they will come from all nations is unknown , but at least from the following four : Britain , America , France , and Japan .

COMMUNIST REGULATIONS AND SHAM COMMUNISM 5 December 1925
&#91; Text &#93; The counterrevolutionaries generally call the national revolution a communist revolution , the Kuomintang the communist party , the National Government a communist government , and the National Revolutionary Army a communist army .
They do so for no other purpose than to fabricate a few simple terms and spread them in accordance with the intent of imperialism in order to split the united front created through the cooperation of the various classes in the national revolution .
But such fabrication has to be rather abstract .
It must not be too concrete , because they may expose themselves and lose their credibility .
However , for the purpose of a lucky win by one single throw , Ch &apos;en Chiung @-@ ming &#91; 7115 3518 2494 &#93; , this time in Tung @-@ chiang , exhausted all means .
He actually fabricated the so @-@ called &quot; Communist By @-@ law &quot; to frighten the people .
One of their handbills , entitled &quot; Urging the People of Kwangtung To Help the Kwangtung Army Punish the Red Party , &quot; states : &quot; Alas !
Do our fathers and brothers know about the Communist By @-@ law drafted by Chiang Chung @-@ cheng &#91; Chiang Kai @-@ shek &#93; ?
I fear that the common people , being ignorant , may think that sharing property means sharing the property of the rich and has nothing to do with the poor in general .
They may even think that it will greatly benefit the poor .
Actually , it is completely false .
I inquired into the said by @-@ law and now generalize as follows : The so @-@ called three @-@ three @-@ three @-@ one system deals with farmland .
The so @-@ called four @-@ four @-@ two system deals with houses .
Plants and stores with rather substantial capital are completely confiscated . &quot; Nevertheless , a recent issue of the Hong Kong KUNG @-@ SHANG .JIH @-@ PAO reported : &quot; The Canton merchant representatives came to Hong Kong , and the Hong Kong merchant representatives received them in the Chinese Merchants &apos; Club and asked them to hold a second general meeting to discuss the solution of strikes and resumption of communication ..
Chinese businessmen and merchants and Canton merchant representatives all sat together at a long table .
Canton merchant representative Chien Ch &apos;in @-@ shih &#91; 4675 3830 4258 &#93; rose and made a statement , saying that the Canton government was actually not practicing communism . &quot; If someone should ask Ch &apos;en Chiung @-@ ming &#91; 7115 3518 2494 &#93; about Chien Shih @-@ ch &apos;in &apos;s &#91; 4675 4258 3830 . &#93; &#91; sic &#93; statement , I imagine he will say : &quot; Chien Shih @-@ ch &apos;in told a lie .
When others took away his property to share , he still insisted that it was not taken away . &quot;

&#91; Text &#93; Tsou Lu &#91; 6760 7627 &#93; said : &quot; Our Koumintang comrades must be aware .
You must not obliterate everything just because others say that the old comrades are non @-@ revolutionary .
Had our comrades not persevered after every setback , there would not have been the republic .
Had the campaigns to fight Yuan &#91; 5913 &#93; , defend the law , punish the bandits , and attack the North not been victorious , there would not bave been today &apos;s history .
Even in the burning of the commercial groups , the masterpiece work of the communists , we still had to rely on Yang &#91; 2799 &#93; and Liu &#91; 0491 &#93; , To hit Yang and Liu , we still had to rely on Hsu &#91; 6079 &#93; and Liang &#91; 27332 .
Even the restraining of Hsu and Llang today , it is still the old comrades . &quot; Excellent !
Mr Tsou !
Please go ahead and revolutionize !
Actually no one has the skill to obliterate the revolutionary old comrades !
You must know that &quot; the republic &quot; and &quot; history &quot; alone do not count .
We must prosecute the revolution now ; we must prosecute , the revolution in the future .
As for old comrades Yang and Liu , or old comrades Hsu and Liang , I think it is better not to give so many examples .

TO TURN LEFT OR RIGHT ?
13 December 1925
&#91; Text &#93; In the past 6 months , some people have been advocating a theory : The left is not good , nor is the right .
Another group has proposed an intermediate opinion : They reject the left as well as the right and indicate that they , themselves , take the middle position .
Such things are not often seen in Kwangtung , but quite widespread in Kiangsu and Chekiang .
The reason is that , in Kwangtung , the left is Canton and the right is Hong Kong .
Standing under the banner of Canton , he inevitably opposes Hong Kong , and vice versa .
Ch &apos;en Chiung @-@ ming &#91; 7115 3518 2494 &#93; leads the counterrevolutionary military , politicians , comprador class , local tyrants , and evil gentry and stands under the banner of Hong Kong , while the Kuomintang leftwing leads the workers , peasants , soldiers , students , merchants , and all types of revolutionary masses and stands under the banner of Canton .
Therefore , they mutually attack each other with artillery .
There can be no intermediate in the midst of such mutual attack .
If there is such an intermediate element , he can only cover himself up and hide under the banner of one side , speaking quietly and treading lightly .
If there is someone standing between Canton and Hong Kong , he will have to declare that &quot; Hong Kong is no good and Canton is also no good . &quot; Then , Hong Kong will train its artillery on him , and so will Canton .
Currently , there has not yet been any incident of mutual attack with artillery in in the Kiangsu @-@ Chekiang area , and therefore , the theory of &quot; both sides no good &quot; flourishes .
On 30 May this year , the artillery of side A rumbled in the Nanking area , but luckily side B had no artillery .
Just fists alone could not become &quot; mutual attack , &quot; and no chaos resulted .
( Strikes did not amount to much ) .
The theory of &quot; both sides no good &quot; can still be openly spread , &quot; retaining righteousness between the two and saving freedom between heaven and earth . &quot; However , if we set up a hypothetical situation , if the masses on Nanking Road had generals as well as fists , and were led by Wang Ching @-@ wei &#91; 3076 4737 5898 &#93; and Chiang K4i @-@ shek , then , when the police station was levelled by artillery , they could immediately occupy the Bureau of Works , capture all the turbaned policement , blockade Wu @-@ sung Harbor , mount artillery in Nan @-@ pei @-@ t &apos;ang and Shih @-@ tzu @-@ lin ( similar to Hu @-@ men ) , and hoist the banner against imperialism over the artillery positions .
By then , Shanghai would unfortunately be in a &quot; chaos , &quot; similar to Canton .
A garrison headquarters would be set
up and those like Mr Wang Mao @-@ kung &#91; 3769 2021 0501 &#93; would be asked to serve as the commander who would then ride around in an armored car every day on the streets .
The &quot; Shih @-@ shih Hsin @-@ pao &quot; and its like would be allowed to publish again ( perhaps also the &quot; Hsing @-@ shih Chou @-@ pao &quot; ) .
Only the majority would be permitted to enjoy the freedom of speech , and the freedom of the minority would have to be deprived , exactly the opposite of before .
By then , the intermediate elements , as in Canton , would not be able to spread their theory openly .
What should they do ?
Naturally , there would still be Peking .
But they could not rely on Peking for long .
It would be contingent on the stability of Executive Tuan &#91; 2008 &#93; .
As long as he remained in power , there would be no problem .
Not only could the Kuomintang Comrades1 Club hoist its sign high , but even the Fourth General Central Committee could hold its meeting there .
It would be even more liberal than in Changchiakou .
While we say this , I am still somewhat confused .
How come Changchiakou does not permit the Fourth Central Committee to hold a meeting ?
Isn &apos;t it also under the jurisdiction of the Tuan government ?
If the Executive Tuan is not there @-@ Wait a minute !
Even when Executive Tuan is there , there can be unforeseen incidents .
Did we not hear that two persons were kidnapped and put into an automobile , taken into the city and beaten up , and forced to write statements of repentance ?
Alas !
Such disturbances could happen even under the rule of Executive Tuan !
The affairs of the world are truly difficult to determine !
Even more distressing : According to the telegram of the Peking Executive Department , a revolutionary movement occurred on 28 November and the urban residents laid siege to the Executive Residence , demanding the ouster of Tuan Ch &apos;i @-@ jui &#91; 3008 4388 3843 &#93; .
It also said that the National Congress decided on three items , and the first was to organize a national government .
( Most unfortunate !
Naturally it will be similar to Canton ! ) .
Then , according to Reuter , &quot; there was a demonstration in Peking on the 28th .
The students carried the banner of Canton , the workers displayed red flags , but no national flag was seen .
The demonstrators scattered handbills , demanding to overthrow Tuan Ch &apos;i @-@ jui , punish Chu Shen &#91; 2612 3234 &#93; , execute the traitors , dissolve the customs conference , arm the people , carry out mass revolution , organize a true national congress , etc . &quot; The &quot; Shin @-@ shih Hsin @-@ pao &quot; headlined the telegram &quot; Frightening Demonstration ! &quot; What &apos;s to be done ?
A &quot; frightening demonstration &quot; happened here !
If , in the future , a &quot; national government &quot; is actually organized and the &quot; Canton banner &quot; is hoisted high over the roof of that government , will it not result in a &quot; chaos &quot; similar to Canton ?
Not just this alone , but the &quot; chaos &quot; may spread to the entire country , imitated everywhere .
The majority may rise to gain their &quot; freedom &quot; and arbitrarily deprive the minority of their freedom .
Gentlemen who stand in the middle !
What should you do ?
To the left ?
Or to the right ?

COMMUNIZATION CLARIFIED 13 December 1925
&#91; Text &#93; &quot; Shen Pao &quot; reports that , according to the telegram from Peking of 23 November , &quot; the diplomatic corps received a detailed report from Kwangtung .
Though Chiang Kai @-@ shek is communistic in his principles , he rather cares for the people .
On tKe contrary , the anticommunist troops of Ch &apos;en &#91; 7115 &#93; , Lin &#91; 2651 &#93; , and Hung &#91; 3163 &#93; perform many communist activities wherever they go . &quot; Thus , communization is caring for the people .
Communization wish it would spread throughout China !

WHO KILLED ALL THE INTELLECTUALS ?
13 December 1925
Accordingly , we can see that each knowledgeable person is merely an intellectual .
As an inevitable consequence of modern industrial development , these intellectuals have long lost the dignity and assurance of their so @-@ called occupational freedom , and have been downgraded temporarily from intermediate class to proletariat .
As such , they must devote themselves wholeheartedly to the worker @-@ peasant movement .
If they should forget their own position in the current society and choose to reverse themselves to serve warlords , compradores , and local despots , then , these knowledgeable youths may be regarded as dead .
By whose hands do they perish ?
They are wasted directly by warlords , compradores , and local despots ; and indirectly they are poisoned by imperialism .

PEKING RIGHTIST CONFERENCE .AND IMPERIALISM 20 December 1925
&#91; Text &#93; Imperialists abhor the Canton Central Executive Committee of the leftist Kuomintang which has assumed general command over the nationwide anti @-@ imperialist movement to strike terror among all imperialists .
The Peking rightist conference adopted a resolution to cease the functions of the Canton Central Executive Committee .
Imperialists abhor the Kuomintang Political Committee which can exercise power to direct the Kwangtung and Hong Kong strikes and to eradicate such useful tools to them as Yang Hsi @-@ min &#91; 2799 1585 7063 &#93; , Liu Chen @-@ huan &#91; 0491 7201 1403 &#93; , Liang Hung @-@ kai &#91; 2733 7703 2261 &#93; , Cheng Jun @-@ chi &#91; 6774 3387 3823 &#93; , Mo Hsiung &#91; 5459 7160 &#93; , Wei Pang @-@ ping &#91; 7614 6721 1726 &#93; , Chen Chiung @-@ ming &#91; 7115 3518 2494 &#93; , Lin Hu &#91; 2651 5706 &#93; , Hung Chao @-@ lin &#91; 3163 0340 7792 &#93; , Teng Pen @-@ yin &#91; 6772 2609 3009 &#93; , and Hsiung Ko @-@ wu &#91; 3574 0344 2976 &#93; .
The Peking rightist conference resolved to dismiss the Political Committee .
Imperialists abhor Kuomintang leftist leader Wang Ching @-@ wei &#91; 3076 4737 5898 &#93; who leads the national revolution in an all @-@ out campaign against imperialism ; and the Peking rightist conference resolved to expel Wang Ching @-@ wei from Party membership .
Imperialists abhor Soviet Russian assistance to the Kuomintang and Nationalist Government employment of Russian advisers to enhance their power to attack imperialism ; and the Peking rightist conference resolved to dischange Russian adviser Borodin .
Imperialists abhor Kuomintang acceptance of Communist Party members to acquire a major force opposing imperialism ; and the Peking rightist conference resolved to expel Li Ta @-@ chao &#91; 2621 1129 6856 &#93; , Tan Ping @-@ shan &#91; 6223 1627 1472 &#93; , and others from Party membership .
Observing all this , we can see what the Peking rightist conference has done for imperialism .

LAST TOOL OF IMPERIALISM 20 December 1925
&#91; Text &#93; As described before , the Peking rightist conference has performed various tasks to meet the requirements of imperialism .
It is , however , the final method used by imperialism against the Chinese anti @-@ imperialist movement .
Imperialist tools Yang Hsi @-@ min &#91; 2799 1585 7036 &#93; and Liu Chen @-@ huan &#91; 0419 7201 1403 &#93; were Ineffective in their attempt to overthrow the Canton government on behalf of the current Peking rightist conference .
Imperialist tools Liang Hung @-@ kai &#91; 2733 7703 2261 &#93; , Cheng Jun @-@ chi &#91; 6774 3387 3823 &#93; , Wei Pang @-@ ping &#91; 7614 6721 1726 &#93; , Mo Hsiung &#91; 5459 7160 &#93; , Chu Cho @-@ wen &#91; 2612 0587 2429 &#93; , and others were also ineffective in carrying out the goal of the current Peking rightist conference after the assassination of Liao Chung @-@ kai &#91; 1675 0112 1956 &#93; .
Imperialist tool Hsiung Ko @-@ wu &#91; 3574 0344 2976 &#93; also failed in his attempt to capture Canton from Pei @-@ chiang on behalf of the current Peking rightist conference .
Imperialist tool Tuan Chi @-@ jui &#91; 3008 4388 3842 &#93; likewise did not succeed in his attempt to attack Canton by warships from Hu @-@ meng .
Imperialist tools Chen Chiung @-@ ming &#91; 7115 3518 2494 &#93; and Teng Pen @-@ yin &#91; 6772 2609 3009 &#93; also failed in their attempt to fight into Canton from the east and the south , on behalf of the current Peking rightist conference .
All these imperialist tools were ineffectual in what they did .
The Kuomintang rightists , aroused in indignation , thus called the Peking conference .
From &quot; Attack by guns , &quot; they changed to the &quot; Resolutions &quot; method .
What is the effect of this method ?
It is difficult to say .
The various resolutions of the rightist conference , to be sure , are only childish resolutions .
This method of &quot; opposition within the next &quot; is truly a progression from &quot; opposition outside the next . &quot; After it has exhausted all tools , imperialism has found this last tool to gain a small consolation in their failure .
Although a few among the rightists may talk about opposing imperialism , although they may serve imperialism without sincerity , and although they
may deny that they have become imperialist tooks , nevertheless , they are in fact effectively helping imperialism .
In reality , they have become imperialist tools , because their work meets the requirements of imperialism .

THE MOST THE RIGHTISTS CAN DO 20 December 1925
&#91; Text &#93; The 3 December editorial of the rightist Shanghai MIN @-@ KUO JIH @-@ PAO stated : &quot; There are only warlords who fear the revolutionary party , but not a revolutionary party which fears warlords . &quot; With this as the rationale , the editorial opposed the following passage in the telegram sent by Wang Ching @-@ wei &#91; 3076 4737 5895 &#93; and others : &quot; A plenary session of the Central Committee is open by nature .
Should it meet in Peking , there would be pressure from warlords from without , and reactionaries from within using warlords to create problems . &quot; MIN @-@ KUO JIH @-@ PAO thus alleged that it would be a show of courage and of disregard of warlords for the plenary session of the Central Committee to meet in Peking .
What is the mistake of MIN @-@ KUO JIH @-@ PAO ?
The mistake lies in ignorance of the fact that there is a difference between the overt and covert activities of a revolutionary party .
Operating under the enemy influence , a truly revolutionary party would maintain , complete secrecy with regard to its party organizations and meetings , but would openly advocate its proposals and conduct propaganda .
Under the enemy influence , it is necessary to obtain prior enemy understanding in order to make public the party organizations and meetings .
In other words , there would be at least a few points benefiting the enemy before the enemy would grant consent or even possibly protection .
However , what would the party be then ?
It would become a friend of the enemy , instead of a revolutionary party aimed against the enemy .
Tuan Chi @-@ jui &#91; 3008 4388 2976 &#93; permitted the rightists to hold their conference in Peking .
Would he also allow Wang Ching @-@ wei , Tan Yen @-@ kai &#91; 6223 1693 0418 &#93; , and others to publicly go to Peking to attend the conference ?
The newspaper also claimed that Premier Sun visited Peking last year without fearing Tuan Chi @-@ jui .
It ignored the two reasons which made it possible for Premier Sun to visit Peking last year : One , Tuan Chi @-@ jui was then new in power , and had neither consolidated his regime nor adopted the policy to oppress the Kuomintang .
Two , control of the police in Peking was then in the hands of Feng Yu @-@ hsiang &#91; 7458 3768 4382 &#93; , who was sympathetic
to the Kuoraintang .
Without these two reasons , it would have been impossible for Mr Sun to openly go to Peking .
If Mr Sun lived today , Tuan Chi @-@ jui certainly would not tolerate his open revolutionary activities in Peking .
He must maintain secrecy , or go elsewhere .
In Peking and other areas throughout the country where warlords are in control , there are Kuoraintang organizations , and party headquarters have organizations everywhere .
Party members and comrade cadres have meetings at all times , as they also bravely engage in efforts striving to eliminate the enemy influence .
All this , however , is secret .
In these organizations and activities , only the leftists are waging incessant struggle , while the rightist party members invariably are seized by fear and dare not to move .
The strong point of rightists is that they can talk , and recite such slogans as &quot; Down with imperialism &quot; and &quot; Down with warlords &quot; without referring to party resolutions .
Once they learn about realistic methods and actions , they immediately lose heart .
The rightists have only their mouth , but not hands or feet .
They have courage to hold a conference in front of Tuan Chi @-@ jui , but would not dare to attend a conference in Canton , because they fear the revolutionary air of Canton .
They have decided to hold their so @-@ called Second National Congress in March next year in either Shanghai or Peking .
My observation is that even if they can call the meeting ( regardless of the number of those attending ) , they may not dare to hold it in Peking , since the court of Tuan is unstable .
They probably would meet in Shanghai .
In the old next of imperialism , they would openly hold the Kuomintang National Conference in front of foreign lords of various foreign consulates and police forces , and thus show off their &quot; courage . &quot; The most the rightists can do is to openly hold conferences in front of warlords and imperialists .
The leftists can never match that !

Pictorial Propaganda
( I ) Importance of Pictorial Propaganda .
.
More than 90 percent of Chinese are illiterate .
Only a small portion of the masses in the country are accessible through the written propaganda of this Party .
Pictorial propaganda is therefore of particular importance .
( II ) Past Accomplishments

Started only in April last year , with little done and limited to Kwangtung , in the following three categories :
( A ) Provide four cartoons weekly to Canton MIN @-@ KUO JIH @-@ PAO ( with omissions sometimes ) .

Wherever the troops are on the march , they post many pictorial propaganda materials , which have considerable influence among the masses .
( 3 ) Various mass organizations .
The Kwangtung peasant and worker organizations have promoted considerable pictorial propaganda to mobilize the worker @-@ peasant masses .
Some pictorial propaganda work has also been done in Peking and Shanghai .
Oral Propaganda
( 1 ) Oral propaganda has an important position in our propaganda effort , in terms of quantity and effect .
( 2 ) At meetings of peasants , workers , soldiers , and students , we have regularly promoted oral propaganda by delivering speeches of all descriptions .

At the Premier Sun weekly memorial meeting , the Party Central headquarters regularly promotes oral propaganda .
Propaganda on 14 Important Events During.the Last Two Years
( 1 ) Reorganization of this Party .
We promulgated the declaration of political program to proclaim opposition to imperialism and its adjuncts , resulting in :
( A ) Enabling the masses to understand this Party and the goal of this Party , and to change their former attitude of skepticism of this Party .
This is extremely effective in propaganda outside the Party .
( B ) Unifying objectives and methods within the Party , and gradually cleaning out those who harbor personal or minority goals and methods .
This also has considerable effect in terms of education within the Party .
( 2 ) Repossession of Canton Customs House .
This anti @-@ imperialist propaganda made clear the break between imperialism and this Party .
It was effective in terms of propaganda .
( 3 ) The anti @-@ imperialist strike in Shan @-@ mien .
( 4 ) Commercial Organization Incident .
We helped the masses to recognize crimes committed by the compradore class .
In this incident , this party &apos;s propaganda effort was inadequate , while the counterrevolutionaries were very enthusiastic in their attack against this party .
( 5 ) Sino @-@ Russian Agreement .
Our compatriots have learned the difference between imperialist countries and anti @-@ imperialist countries among nations .
Anti @-@ imperialist alliances rose in Peking and other areas .
The slogan &quot; Oppose imperialism &quot; has begun to be accepted by the masses .
To this end , our Party has issued a statement .
( 6 ) Anti @-@ Hopeh Campaign .
The masses have lost faith in this power warlord .
Mr Sun promulgated the Declaration of the Northern Expedition .
( 7 ) Premier Traveled North .
The Statement on Travel North pointed out two slogans : &quot; Hold National Conference &quot; and &quot; Abrogate Unequal Treaties . &quot;
( 8 ) Movement to Promote National Conference .
Opposition to Tuan Chi @-@ jui resulted in the masses losing faith in Tuan &apos;s fence @-@ mending conference .
At the same time , the masses have further realized the political proposals of this party .
During this campaign , the two slogans : &quot; Hold National Conference &quot; and &quot; Abrogate Unequal Treaties &quot; have gained greater acceptance among the masses .
( 9 ) Campaign for memorial of the Premier .
It helped the masses to understand Mr Sun , this Party , and the goal of this party .
This extensive memorial campaign spread far and wide , extending to remote and secluded areas .
The two slogans of &quot; Hold National Conference &quot; and &quot; Abrogate Unequal Treaties &quot; have thus penetrated further among the masses .
At this time , this party issued the statement severing contact with Tuan Chi @-@ jui .
( 10 ) 30 May Movement ..
An unprecedented anti @-@ imperialist movement in which specific meanings were mentioned for abrogating the unequal treaties , such as repossess concessions , customs house , and judiciary ; and evacuation of foreign navies and armies stationed in China .
Through this , the masses recognized what are the unequal treaties .
This movement failed under extreme pressure exerted by the Liaoning warlords .
There was , however , one accomplishment : the Shanghai workers have risen .
In terms of propaganda , the movement was very effective for the rural masses have universally come to know that this party has issued a declaration to support the people in resisting imperialism .
( 11 ) Liao Case .
The masses realized the brutality of imperialists and their lackeys .
Through memorial services , and written and pictorial m ; terialsj this party has promoted considerable propaganda .
( 12 ) Anti @-@ Liao @-@ ning Campaign .
We helped the masses to learn the relationship between imperialism and their tool , the Chinese warlords ; and to recognize the rapid collapse of Chinese warlords .
In the course of this campaign , the masses felt a closeness to the success of the revolution .
In the movement opposing Tuan in various areas , slogans were introduced to initiate direct clash against the local warlords , such as the Peking masses1 slogan of &quot; Expel Tuan Chi @-@ jui , &quot; Wuhan masses1 slogan &quot; Expel Pei @-@ fu , 11 and Changsha masses &apos; slogan &quot; Down with Chao Heng @-@ ti &#91; 6392 1854 1912 &#93; . &quot; The masses have changed their former peaceful attitude into a tense revolutionary atmosphere .
( 13 ) Anti @-@ religious Movement .
During the last 2 years , anti @-@ Christian organizations and propaganda have spread throughout the country to enable the masses to be aware of the imperialist religious aggression .
( 14 ) Political education in peace time and political propaganda in war time among troops .
The political education promoted by this party in Huangpu Military Academy and National Revolutionary Army has created a military force against imperialism .
The propaganda for military @-@ civilian unity as launched in various campaigns in Kwangtung has assured that the troops love and protect the people , and that the people support the troops .
This has been a great success of this party .
Enemy Propaganda
Part of our propaganda , by necessity , must aim at the enemy &apos;s propaganda .
Now we should take a look at the antirevolutionary propaganda waged by the enemy during the last 2 years .
I
( 1 ) Imperialism .
During the last 2 years , since this party has particularly
heightened the anti @-@ imperialist propaganda , the imperialist propaganda to calumniate this party has also been especially fierce .
The imperialists raised the two slogans of &quot; Oppose communism &quot; and &quot; Red imperialism &quot; to call on their tools in China , bureaucrats , warlords , compradores , and local despots to attack this party .
Foreign newspapers and foreign news agencies in Hong Kong , Shanghai , Tientsin , Shenyang , and Hankou have created rumors to caluminate and sow dissension , and have tried their utmost wherever they can .
( 2 ) Warlords of all factions .
Warlords of all sizes and factions in the country invariably support and expand the two slogans issued by imperialists ( Oppose communism , Red imperialism ) .
( 3 ) Compradore Class .
Besides their anti @-@ revolutionary propaganda , this group has shown greater effort than any other counterrevolutionary faction .
The Hong Kong KUNG @-@ SHANG JIH @-@ PAO and Shanghai HSIN @-@ WEN @-@ PAO are representative .
( 4 ) Research Faction .
They uphold the interest of bureaucrats and large landlords , and also engage in counterrevolutionary propaganda .
SHIH @-@ SHIH HSIIfJWEN and CHEN @-@ PAO are representative .
( 5 ) An @-@ fu Faction .
They represent Japanese imperialism and likewise engage in counterrevolutionary propaganda .
HSIN @-@ SHENG @-@ PAO is representative *
( 6 ) LIEN @-@ CHIH @-@ PAI .
They support &apos; the interest of bureaucrats and landlords , and .also promote counterevolutionary propaganda .
CHUNG @-@ HUA HSIN @-@ PAO is representative .
( 7 ) Nationalist Faction .
They have acquired some trappings of Western nationalism to support the interest of small landlords and the Chinese industrial and commercial bourgeoisie , and are very enthusiastic in &quot; opposing communism &quot; and &quot; opposing Soviet Russia . &quot; HSIN @-@ SHIH WEEKLY is representative .
( 8 ) Right @-@ wing Kuomintang .
After the HSI @-@ SHAN Conference , the right wing of this party has also acquired the slogans &quot; oppose communism &quot; and &quot; oppose Soviet Russia , &quot; and has competed against the above other counterrevolutionary factions in their hostile attitude toward this party .
Shanghai MIN @-@ rKUO JIH @-@ PAO is their representative .
In the mutual antagonism between revolutionary propaganda and counterrevolutionary propaganda during the last 2 years , the revolutionary propaganda has adopted an offensive .
This offensive was particularly illustrative during the 30 May Movement .
The counterrevolutionary propaganda has consistently been defensive .
When they could not cope with the offensive , they resorted to the slogans &quot; Oppose communism &quot; and &quot; Red imperialism &quot; as protective covers .
This phenomenon of antagonistic offensive and defensive came as a result of the Chinese revolutionary force dally enhancement of unity and progress , while the counterrevolutionary force became increasingly more shaky and leaned toward collapse .
Defects
The following defects have been discovered in the propaganda work during the last 2 years :
( 1 ) Party newspapers are faulty .
( 2 ) Propaganda on various important events lacks promptness in guidance and falls short of full coverage .
( 3 ) The command system is imperfect .
There is a lack of coordination between the upper and lower level party headquarters , leading to an each @-@ for @-@ himself situation .
Consequently , many responsible persons of the propaganda department have abandoned their duties .
( 4 ) Inspection and correction were completely ignored .
( 5 ) Sufficient collection of propaganda materials and supply of them to lower level party headquarters have not been done .
( 6 ) There was little evidence of planned education within the party .
( 7 ) More stress was on urban masses than on general masses , more on written propaganda than on pictorial propaganda .
The above are all major defects in the propaganda work of this party .
Each should be corrected in the future .

ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS STRATA OF CHINESE PEASANTRY AND THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD REVOLUTION
January 1926
&#91; Text &#93; Wherever you go in rural areas , as you carefully observe , you will see the following eight different categories of persons :
Big landlords
Small landlords
Owner peasants
Semi @-@ owner peasants
Semi @-@ hired peasants
Poor peasants
Hired peasants and rural handicraft workers
Vagabonds
These eight categories of persons are divided into eight classes .
Their financial positions and living conditions vary , and affect their psychology and their differing views regarding revolution .
A large number of large landlords in China come from decendents of former Ching Dynasty bureaucrats and current bureaucrats and warlords3 while a small number of them are rich urban merchants who , purchased land .
Very few big landlords built up their fortune through farming .
They base their interest on severe exploitation of owner @-@ peasants , semi @-@ owner peasants , semi @-@ hired peasants , poor peasants , and hired peasants .
There are five methods of exploitation .
First is heavy rent , varying between 50 to 80 percent .
This is a very common and ruthless exploitation of the semi @-@ owner peasants , semi @-@ hired peasants , and poor peasants .
The second is usury , with the monthly interest rate at 3 to 7 percent , and the annual interest at 36 to 84 percent .
This exploitation also applies to semi @-@ owner peasants , semi @-@ hired peasants , and poor peasants .
This is sometimes an even more ruthless exploitation than heavy rent , and often results in complete bankruptcy within a few years due to accumulation of debts and compounding of interest .
The third is heavy contributions , using pressure to force the owner @-@ peasants and semi @-@ owner peasants to offer contributions to the
expenses of local defense regiments according to acreage owned .
Such local defense regiments are landlord class armies needed for suppressing peasant uprisings to maintain the landlord class exploiting system .
The fourth is exploitation of hired peasants , that is , exploiting their surplus labor .
In China , however , there is not much capitalist agriculture yet .
Big landlords usually do not manage land themselves .
For this reason , more small landlords than big landlords employ this form of exploitation .
The fifth form of exploitation is that used by warlords in collusion with corrupt bureaucrats to levy heavy land taxes and demand high interest from peasants who are unable to pay on time .
It is impossible to describe the miseries of peasants suffering from these five types of exploitation .
The Chinese big landlords are , therefore , the deadly enemies of Chinese peasants , the true rules in the countryside , the solid foundation of imperialists and warlords , only stronghold of feudal patriarch society , and the ultimate reason for emergence of all counterrevolutionary forces .
Estimated on the basis of collecting yield from over 500 mou , the number of big landlords ( including their families ) account for about one @-@ tenth of 1 percent among peasants .
Among the 320,000,000 peasants in the country ( estimated at 80 percent of the population ) , they total about 320,000 .
The small landlords are much more numerous than the big landlords , totalling more than 2 million in the country .
Most of them come from their own farms , that is , they rose from owner @-@ peasants .
Some of them are urban merchants who bought land , and others are degenerate decendents of bureaucrats and current petty @-@ bureaucrats .
They employ heavy rent , usury , and exploitation of surplus labor as methods of exploitation .
They suffer from oppression by warlords and big landlords , and are therefore rebellious .
They also , however , fear &quot; communism , &quot; and thus adopt a contradictory attitude toward modern revolution .
In our country , high intellectuals such as teachers and students in colleges and higher schools , as well as students studying in Japan and the West , are mostly from small landlord families .
They advocate the so @-@ called nationalism .
The reason is that small landlords are the medium @-@ properties class in China with an ambition to attain the ^ position of big bourgeoisie and to establish a nation ruled by one class .
Beset by foreign capital and oppression by warlords , they need revolution .
They are , however , also skeptical about revolution since in themodern Chinese revolutionary movement , there is within the country wholehearted participation of the national proletariat and , internationally , vigorous support by the international proletariat .
There is a true Tai Chi @-@ t &apos;ao &apos;s &#91; 2071 1323 7118 &#93; disciple ( by his own description ) who states in PEKING CHEN @-@ PAO : &quot; Raise your left hand to strike down imperialists and your right hand against the communist party . &quot; This is a vivid Illustration of the contradictory and frightened attitude of this class .
They oppose interpretation of people &apos;s livelihood principle by class struggle and object to Kuomintang association with Russia and acceptance of coimflunists .
These constitute the right wing of the Chinese medium @-@ properties class .
They are inclined to lean toward a counterrevolutionary position .
There Is , however , also a left wing In the medium @-@ properties class which at the proper moment can be led toward
revolution .
For instance , at the height of the peasant association movement , the leftists among small landlords can be guided to help peasant associations .
By nature , they compromise easily , since they are related by blood to the right wing of small landlords , and are strangers to peasant associations .
We cannot expect them to come forward bravely to the revolutionary road and to devote themselves faithfully to the revolutionary cause as other classes do , except for the small number of them who are molded differently by history and circumstances .
The owner @-@ peasants belong to petty @-@ bourgeoisie and subdivide into three categories .
In the first category , there are owner @-@ peasants who have surplus cash and provisions .
Besides providing for themselves , there is a surplus every year in their income from labor performed , usable as preliminary accumulation of capital .
These persons harbor a strong concept of &apos; &apos; prosperity . &quot; While they do not vainly hope for great prosperity , they always attempt to climb up to the position of small landowner .
They usually envy those small property owners who enjoy respectability , and devoutly worship Marshal Chao @-@ kung .
They are timid , afraid of bureaucracy , and also somewhat fear revolution .
Since their financial position approximates that of the small landlords of the intermediate properties class , they subscribe to such propaganda as &quot; Beware of radical party &quot; and &quot; Beware of communism , &quot; as propagated by those &quot; elderly , &quot; &quot; honorable , &quot; and &quot; respected &quot; small landlords in the countryside .
These words of advice for caution , to be sure , originate from the &quot; seniors &quot; and the &quot; lords &quot; among the landlords .
These persons with surplus cash and provisions constitute the right wing of petty @-@ bourgeoisie .
Before they learn the truth about modern revolution , they adopt a skeptical attitude .
They are , however , a minority among owner @-@ peasants , amounting to perhaps less than 10 percent of the total .
In China , the number of owner @-@ peasants , some say , exceed the total of hired peasants and farm laborers .
Excluding the semi @-@ owner peasants , however , they certainly account for only a minority among peasants , totalling about 100 to 120 million .
The well @-@ to @-@ do portion among owner @-@ peasants account for about 10 percent , or a total of 12 million .
The second category of owner @-@ peasants are barely self @-@ sufficient .
Their annual income and expenditures are balanced without surplus or deficit .
While these owner @-@ peasants are quite different from those of the first category , they likewise long for prosperity .
Marshal Chao Kung , however , has never granted them wealth .
In the wake of oppression and exploitation perpetrated by imperialists , warlords , and landlords in recent years , they feel that the world is not what it used to be .
They realize that by continuing the same amount of labor as they did before , they would not be able to maintain their livelihood .
They must increase their time at work , that is , start earlier and stop later every day , arid pay greater attention to production before they can maintain their livelihood .
They curse others , denouncing foreigners as &quot; devils , &quot; warlords as &quot; money grabbers , &quot; and local despots as &quot; the filthy rich . &quot; They are skeptical whether the movement against imperialists and warlords will ever succeed ( their rationale :
foreigners and the military are more powerful ) , and thus would not dare to participate .
They adopt a neutral attitude , but would never oppose revolution .
This portion of owner @-@ peasants are numerous , accounting for about one @-@ half of all owner @-@ peasants , or ; nearly 60,000,000 persons .
The third category of owner @-@ peasants are those who show a deficit year after year .
Many of these owner @-@ peasants were formerly the so @-@ called solid , honest persons who gradually turn more reserved and deficient .
At the year @-@ end accounting , they are alarmed at every occasion and would declare : &quot; Well , another deficit . &quot; Since they lived well , before their gradual decline and accrument of debts , they begin to realize &quot; the future is uncertain and frightening . &quot; They are miserable in spirit , for they tend to contrast the present and the past .
These persons are rather important to the revolution and can contribute to its progress .
They number about 40 percent of owner @-@ peasants , or 48,000,000 persons .
A sizeable mass , they constitute the left @-@ wing of.petty @-@ bourgeoisie .
In time of peace , the afore @-@ described three categories of owner @-@ peasants hold different attitudes toward modern Chinese revolution .
Once at war , that is , at the high tide of revolution when the dawn of victory is visible , not only the left wing owner @-@ peasants in the third category would immediately join the revolution , but the neutral owner @-@ peasants of the second category would also participate in revolution .
Pressured by hired peasants and the leftwing owner @-@ peasants , even the rightist owner @-@ peasants in the first category would also go along with revolution .
Accordingly , the petty @-@ bourgeois owner @-@ peasants can all turn to favor revolution .
The semi @-@ owner peasants , semi @-@ hired peasants , and farm laborers number about 150,000,000 to 170,000,000 among Chinese peasantry .
Separately , semi @-@ owner peasants account for about 50,000,000 , while semi @-@ hired peasants and farm laborers each account for 60,000,000 .
They constitute the huge masses in the countryside .
Most of the so @-@ called peasant problems concern them .
While all three categories of peasants are among the semi @-@ proletariat , their financial conditions differ .
The semi @-@ owner peasants live a more miserable life than the owner @-@ peasants , since the former must rent farmland from others or engage in small business to make up the difference in their deficit of provisions .
They must incur debt and borrow grain at high interest rates during the season between spring and summer , while the owner @-@ peasants would not have to depend on others .
The semi @-@ owner peasants nevertheless are better off than the semi @-@ hired peasants who own no land and must work on others &apos; farmland to receive only half of the harvest .
While the semi @-@ owner peasants also receive only half or less on the farmland which they rent from others , they can receive the entire harvest from the land which they own .
Accordingly , the semi @-@ owner peasants are more revolutionary than the owner @-@ peasants , but less so than the semi @-@ hired peasants .
The semi @-@ hired peasants and farm laborers are both hired peasants in the countryside , and suffer from landlord exploitation , although their financial
positions differ .
The serai @-@ hired peasants do not own land , but they have adequate farm tools and some liquid capital .
Peasants in this group can receive one half of their annual productive labor .
They make up for the deficit by growing miscellaneous grains , catching fish and shrimp , and keeping chickens and pigs to eke out their livelihood .
In their assiduous struggle for livelihood , they take comfort in the thought of working hard for life .
Their livelihood is more miserable than that of serai @-@ owner peasants , but better than farm laborers .
On the other hand , they are more revolutionary than the semi @-@ owner peasants , but less so than fara laborers .
The farm laborers constitute the agricultural proletariat .
There are the long @-@ term laborers , monthly laborers , and sundry laborers .
These farm laborers not only own no land and farm implements , but also not the slightest liquid capital .
They live from hand to mouth every day .
They exceed other workers in their long hours of work , meager wages , poor treatment , and uncertainty of employment .
These persons suffer the most in the countryside .
In promoting the peasant movement , we must pay particular attention to them .
In the countryside , handicraft workers hold a higher position than the farm laborers , since the former have their own tools and also perform a free occupation .
With burden of families , and wages incompatible with cost of living , the handicraft workers share the oppression of poverty and the fear of unemployment with farm laborers , and lead a life similar to that of farm laborers .
The vagabond proletariat consist of peasants who lost their land and handicraft workers who lost the opportunity to work because of exploitation and oppression perpetrated by imperialists , warlords , and landlords , and flood , -drought , and other natural disasters .
Among them are soldiers , bandits , thieves , beggars , and prostitutes .
The five are designated and regarded by society differently , although they are alike as human beings .
In their different methods of seeking the same end of livelihood , the soldiers engage in &quot; fighting , &quot; the bandits in &quot; robbing , &quot; the thieves in &quot; stealing , &quot; the beggars in &quot; pleading , &quot; and prostitutes in &quot; charming . &quot; They are the most unstable among mankind .
In all areas , they have their won secret organizations , such as San @-@ ho @-@ hui &#91; 0005 5071 2585 &#93; in Hunan , Hupeh , Kueichou , and Szechwan ; Ta @-@ tao @-@ hui &#91; 1129 0430 2585 &#93; in Anhwei , Honan , and Shantung ; Tsai @-@ li @-@ hui &#91; 0961 3810 2585 &#93; in Hopeh and the northeast provinces ; and the Blue Gang in Shanghai , as mutual @-@ aid organizations in their political and financial struggles .
The settlement of these persons constitute one of the greatest and most difficult problems in China .
As poverty and unemployment are two problems in China , a settlement of the unemployment problem would amount to putting to rest one @-@ half of the problems in China .
The number of Chinese vagabond proletariat is alarming , totalling more than 20,000,000 .
These persons are capable of brave struggle .
Under proper guidance , they can become a revolutionary force .
In organizing peasants , we mean to organiae owner @-@ peasants , semi @-@ owner peasants , semi @-@ hired peasants , farm laborers , and handicraft workers into one
organization .
In principle , we employ the method of strife against landlords to demand financial and political concessions .
In special circumstances , such as we encounter in Haifeng and Kwangning where the roost reactionary and vicious local despots are tramping upon the people , we must completely strike them down .
Regarding the vagabond proletariat , we should persuade them to help the peasant associations and to join the great revolutionary movement to seek settlement of the unemployment problem .
We should not force them to join the enemy side to become part of the counterrevolutionary force. j

ANALYSIS OF THE CLASSES IN CHINESE SOCIETY 1 February 1926
&#91; Text &#93; Who are our enemies ?
Who are our friends ?
One cannot be a revolutionist if one cannot distinguish between enemies and friends .
It is , however , by no means easy to distinguish between enemies and friends .
That the Chinese revolution has been going on for 30 years with scant results is not due to errors in its goal , but is entirely due to errors in strategy .
The so @-@ called errors in strategy were that we could not rally pur real friends to attack our real enemies .
The reason why we could not do this was that we did not distinguish who were our enemies and who were our friends .
A revolutionary party is a guide of the masses .
In the army , there can be no victory in fighting if its guide leads them astray .
In a revolutionary movement , it will be impossible to avoid failure if the revolutionary party takes the wrong road .
We are all revolutionaries who lead the way for the masses , and are the guides for the masses .
Nonetheless , we cannot but ask ourselves : &quot; Do we have this ability ?
Won &apos;t we lead the masses onto the road of defeat ?
Are we sure to succeed ?
In order to ensure that we will &quot; not lead to the wrong road &quot; and &quot; be sure to succeed , &quot; we cannot but devote ourselves to an important strategy .
In order to decide on this strategy , it is necessary to first .distinguish between those who are our enemies and those who are our friends .
The Manifesto of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang served as the declaration of this strategy and the distinction between enemies and friends .
But this manifesto is rather simplistic .
If we want to understand this important strategy and to distinguish between real enemies and friends , we must make a general analysis on the economic status , class characters , and number of people of the various classes in Chinese society , and their attitudes towards the revolution .
There are bound to be three classes of people in any countrythe upper , middle and lower classes .
A detailed analysis will show five classesthe big bourgeoisie , the middle bourgeoisie , the &apos; petty bourgeoisie , the semi @-@ proletariat and the proletariat .
In the case of the rural areas , the : big
landlords constitute the big bourgeoisie , the small landlords are the middle bourgeoisie , the self @-@ farming peasants are the petty bourgeoisie ; the tenant peasants are the semi @-@ proletariat , and the hired peasants are the proletariat .
Iri the case of the cities , the big bourgeoisie are the big bankers , the big businessmen and the big industrialists .
The money @-@ shop owners , the middle merchants and the small factory owners are the middle bourgeoisie , while the small merchants and handicrafts operators are the petty bourgeoisie .
The shopkeepers , peddlers and handicraftsmen are the semi @-@ proletariat , and factory workers and the so @-@ called coolie are the proletariat .
These five categories of people fall into different economic strata , and are fraught with varying class character .
Consequently , they cherish diverse attitudes toward the contemporary revolution , such as being counterrevolutionary , semi @-@ counterrevolutionary , neutral toward revolution , taking part in revolution , or serving as the main force of revolution .
The attitude of the various classes in China toward the national revolution resembles almost completely the attitude of the various classes in the capitalist countries of Western Europe toward their social revolution .
This may seem strange , but it really is not .
The reason is that the contemporary revolution &#91; and the social revolution in Europe &#93; is one and the same , Sought with a similar goal and tactic .
The goal is to overthrow international capitalist imperialism , and the tactic is to unite the oppressed peoples and oppressed classes to fight together .
This is the greatest characteristic which makes the contemporary revolution different from all revolutions in history .
Let us take a look at the various classes in Chinese society .
First , there is the big bourgeoisie .
In economically backward and semi @-@ colonial China , the big bourgeoisie was the vassal of the international capitalists .
The prerequisites of its existence and development depended on imperialism .
For example , &#91; they included &#93; compradoressuch as bankers ( Lu Tsung @-@ yu and Ch &apos;en Lien @-@ por ) , merchants , ( T ^ ang Shao @-@ i and Robert Ho @-@ tung ) , industrialists ( Chang Ch ? ien and Sheng En @-@ hsi ) , big landlords , ( Chang Tso @-@ lin and Ch &apos;en Kung @-@ shou ) , bureaucrats ( Sun Pao @-@ chfi and Yen Hui @-@ chring ) , and warlords ( Chang Tso @-@ lin and Ts &apos;ao Kr : un ) .
Reactionary intellectualsthey are the appendages of the four categories of people mentioned above .
The higher ranking staff of compradore types of banks , industries and business , plutocrats , high government officials , politicians , some returned students from Japan and the West , professors and students of universities and colleges , and lawyers are also in this class .
This class is entirely incompatible with the goals of the national revolution .
Standing consistently on the side of imperialism , they are extremely counterrevolutionary .
They number fewer than 1 million , which is .25 percent of our population of 400 million people , and they are the deadly enemies of the national revolutionary movement .
Second , there is the middle bourgeoisie .
This is the Chinese @-@ owned banking , and industrial and commercial class .
In economically &quot; backward China , the development of banks , and industry and business is still limited to the middle bourgeoisie .
The so @-@ called banks refer to small banks and money shops , while industry refers to factories on a small scale , and commerce refers to merchants handling native goods .
All big banks and industry and business had some ties with capital , and they can only be classified under the comprador class . )
The small landlords class .
Many of the higher intelligentsiasuch as the staff of the Chinese @-@ owned banks , the industrial and business establishments , most of the returned students from Japan and the West , some college professors and students , and small lawyers belonged to this class .
It was the ambition of this class to strive for the status of the big bourgeoisie , but it was hampered by the impact of foreign capital and the oppression of the warlords .
Consequently , this class has adopted a contradictory attitude toward the national revolution .
That is , whenever they feel the agonies of the blow of foreign capital and the oppression of the warlords , they wanted to engage in revolution and supported the anti @-@ imperialist and anti @-@ warlord revolutionary movement .
However , because of the vigorous participation in the present revolutionary movement by the proletariat at home and the active support of the international proletariat abroad , they sensed a threat to the existence and development of the big bourgeoisie status to which they aspire .
Thus , they have become suspicious of the revolution .
This class is the so @-@ called national bourgeoisie whose political platform is nationalismto realize a state ruled by a single class , the national bourgeoisie .
The &quot; true disciple &quot; ( as he professed himself ) of this is Tai Chi @-@ t &apos;ao who wrote in CHEN PAO , Peking : &quot; Raise your left hand to overthrow imperialism and your right hand to overthrow the Communists ! &quot; This describes vividly the contradiction and ambivalence of this class .
They are opposed to using the theory of class struggle to interpret the Principle of &apos; the People &apos;s Livelihood ; they are opposed to the Kuomintang1s alliance with Russia and the admission of communists into that party .
Nonetheless , the attempt of this class to realize a state ruled by the national bourgeoisie has proved to be completely infeasible .
This is because the current world situation is one in which the two great forces of revolution and counterrevolution are locked in a final struggle .
Hoisted by these two great forces are two large banners : one being the red banner of revolution which is held high by the Third International , calling on the oppressed nations and classes to stand under it on one side ; the other being the white banner of counterrevolution , which is held high by the League of Nations , calling on the counterrevolutionaries of the world to stand under it on the other side .
It is therefore essential for the intermediate classes , such as the so @-@ called Second International in the West , and the so @-@ called Nationalists in China , to be separated quickly , either to turn left to join the revolutionists , or to turn right to join the counterrevolutionaries .
There could be no room for their &quot; independence . &quot; Consequently5 the ideology of an &quot; independent &quot; revolution on the part of China &apos;s middle bourgeoisie with its own class interests as the main basis is merely an illusion .
Although they are still
only semi @-@ counterrevolutionary , and although they have not yet become our frontal enemies , nevertheless , as they begin to feel more the threat of the workers and peasant class , and as they are compelled more and more to make concessions to the interests of the workers and peasants class ( such as the rent reduction movement in rural villages and labor strikes in the cities ) , they or a portion of them $ ( the right wing of the middle bourgeoisie ) are bound to stand on the side of ^ imperialism , thereby becoming counterrevolutionary and our enemies completely .
It has transpired that between compradores and noncompradores , there are some who cannot be distinguished readily .
Take commerce for example , it is true that among many merchants , there is a very clear distinction between merchants of foreign goods and merchants of native products .
Nonetheless , in some shops , they offer both native and foreign goods side by side .
Take the intellectual class for example , there &apos; &apos; are many returned students from Japan among the children of small landlords .
It is true that apart from their semi @-@ native flavor , they have also acquired some semi @-@ foreign flavor .
Even among the children of small landlords who study in universities and colleges in China , because they have been taught by returned students that are semi @-@ native and semi @-@ foreign , they could not but become semi @-@ native and semi @-@ foreign themselves .
These people cannot be characterized as purely national bourgeoisie , but may be called &quot; semi @-@ national bourgeoisie . &quot; This is the right wing of middle bourgeoisie , and when the struggle of national revolution is intensified , they are bound to hasten to join the ranks of imperialist warlords , thereby becoming good companions of the compradores .
The left wing of middle bourgeoisie , namely , those who are totally unaffiliated with imperialism , might be rather revolutionary at times ( sucH as during the high tide of some boycott of foreign goods ) .
Nonetheless , it is not easy to shatter their vain concept of &quot; peace , 11 and they are constantly frightened by the so @-@ called &quot; Bolshevization . &quot; They tend to be compromising toward revolution and cannot last long .
Thus , there are also many dangerous elements in China &apos;s middle bourgeoisie , whether they belong to the right wing or the left wing .
With the exception of a small minority who have special historical background and environment , we cannot expect them to bravely embark on the revolutionary road , and undertake the .
revolutionary enterprise loyally along with the other classes .
The number of people in the- middle bourgeoisie is at most one in every 100 ( 1 percent ) in China , and so there are about 4 million of them .
Third , The Petty Bourgeoisie
To this category belong the owner peasants , small merchants , handicrafts operators , small intellectualsminor officials , clerks , middle school students and teachers , small lawyers , etc .
Both numerically and in its class characters , this class deserves great attention .
The owner peasants of the petty bourgeois alone number some 100 to 120 million ; the number of small merchants , handicrafts operators and intellectuals ranges from 20 to 30 million .
The combined total is about 130 million .
Although these people share the same bourgeois economic status , there are , in fact , three different sections .
The first section comprises those people who have surplus money and rice ,
that is , after supporting themselves with the income from their own physical or mental labor , they can still have some surpluses each year which can be used to create the so @-@ called preliminary accumulation of capital .
This kind of people are strongly inclined to &quot; get rich . &quot; Although they have no illusions tflCamass huge fortunes , they nevertheless want to climb to the status of piddle bourgeoisie .
They envy those who have gathered a small fortune and who seem to get so much respect , and consequently , they worship Marshal Chao &#91; the legendary god of wealth &#93; diligently .
They are rather timorous , being &apos;afraid of officials and also of &apos; revolution to some extent .
Because of the fact that their economic status approaches that of the middle bourgeoisie , they are therefore rather susceptible to the latter &apos;s propaganda ; and tend to be skeptical toward revolution .
However , this section is a minority among the petty bourgeoisie , being less than 10 percent of them , or about 15 million , forming the right wing of the petty bourgeoisie .
The second section of the petty bourgeoisie is barely self @-@ sufficient , as their annual income is about equal to their expenditure .
They differ largely from the first sectionof people .
They also would like to be rich , but Marshal Chao won &apos;t let them .
Under the oppression and exploitation of imperialism , warlords , and big and middle bourgeoisie in recent years , they have begun to realize that the present world is no longer like the world of the past .
They realize that if they should expend the same labor as they did before , it would not be possible to maintain their livelihood .
It is now necessary to increase labor time by rising early and paying double attenton to their chores in order to survive .
They become abusive : they dub foreigners &quot; foreign devils , &quot; scold the warlords as &quot; robber commanders , &quot; and denounce local despots and evil gentry for their &quot; ill @-@ begotten wealth . &quot; In regard to the anti @-@ imperialist and anti @-@ warlord movements , their only doubt is that they might not succeed , because &quot; foreigners and commanders seemed to be so formidable &quot; to them .
Thus , they take a neutral stand , not daring to participate in it resolutely , though they are absolutely by no means anti @-@ revolutionary .
The number of this section isjvery large , almost one @-@ half of the petty bourgeoisie , or 75 million .
The third section consists of those who incur deficits every year .
Many of these people used to belong to families of moderate means , but they have declined gradually , becoming barely able to break even at first , and suffering from losses later .
At the time of settlement of accounts each year , they are shocked , sighing : &quot; We have lost money again ! &quot; Because they have had better times before , they would &quot; shudder at the future prospects &quot; as their fortunes declined and as they contracted more and more debts .
Because of this comparison between now and before , these people are important in the revolutionary movement and have the strength to push the revolution forward .
Their number is about 40 percent of the petty bourgeoisie or 60 million .
They are sizable among the petty bourgeoisie and form its left wing .
The above @-@ mentioned three sections of the petty bourgeoisie may differ in their attitudes toward the revolution at normal time .
But in wartime , that is , when the revolutionary tide is high and when victory seems to be in sight , then not only the left wing but also the middle section of petty bourgeoisie would join the revolution .
The
right wingers , under the impact of the proletariat and the left wing of the petty bourgeoisie , could not but also join it .
Judging.our experiences from the 30 May Movement and the peasant movement in the last 2 years , this assessment seems to be correct .
Fourth , The Semi @-@ Proletariat
The so @-@ called semi @-@ proletariat mentioned here consists of : ( 1 ) the semi @-@ owner peasants , ( 2 ) tenant peasants , ( 3 ) poor peasants , ( 4 ) handicraftsmen , ( 5 ) shop assistants , and ( 6 ) peddlers .
Among the peasants of China , the number of semi @-@ owner peasants is about 50 million , while tenant peasants and poor peasants number some 60 million each , making a total of 170 million .
The so @-@ called peasant problem is largely their problem .
Although these three kinds of peasants belong to the semi @-@ proletariat together , their economic conditions may be further classified as upper , middle and poor .
In the case of semi @-@ owner peasants , their lives are worse than the owner peasants because they are short of one half of the food they need for sustenance .
To make up the deficit , they have to rent land from others , or to work for others , or engage in petty trade .
In late spring and early summer when the harvest is not yet ready , they often have to borrow money at usurious interest rates or buy grain at exorbitant prices .
Their situation is naturally worse than that of the owner peasants who are self @-@ sufficient , but better than that of the tenant peasants .
This is because of the fact that the tenant peasants do not own land , and so they can take in only half of the harvest each year .
The serai @-@ owner peasants , though they can garner only half of the harvest from their rented land , or even less than half of it , they can , nonetheless , reap the entire harvest of the land they own .
Thus , the revolutionary character of semi @-@ owner peasants is better than that of the owner peasants , but not as great as that of the tenant peasants .
Both the tenant peasants and the poor peasants are tenants exploited by landlords , though there is some difference in their economic status .
Although tenant peasants do not have land , they have sufficient .
farm implements and some current capital .
Such peasants can .
earn half of their own fruits of labor , and the shortages can be made up by planting cereal crops , fishing , chicken farming and pig @-@ raising , thereby enabling them to eke out a living .
They may suffer from hardships , but their livelihood is harder than that of the semi @-@ owner peasants but better off than that of the poor peasants .
Nonetheless , their revolutionary character is superior to that of semi @-@ owner peasants , but not as good as that of the poor peasants .
In the case of poor peasants , they lack not only sufficient farm implements , but also current capital .
Moreover , they are short of fertilizers , and when there is lean harvest , they earn almost nothing after delivering their rents .
During a famine , they have often to beg their friends and relatives to borrow a few sheng or bushels of grain to tide them over for a few days .
They become burdened with heavy debts .
They are the most distressed among the peasants , and so are more receptive to revolutionary propaganda .
The handicraftsmen are called semi @-@ proletariat because they own their own tools and are also self @-@ employed .
Their economic
status resembles that of tenant peasants in agriculture .
But because of their heavy family burdens and because of the gap between wages and living costs , they are often plagued by poverty and by the dread of unemployment , resembling largely what happens to tenant peasants .
The shop assistants are employees of middle and small merchants earning meagre wages to eke out a living .
However , despite the steady increases of commodity prices every year , their pay is adjusted only once in several years .
They will tell you their sad story if you should get into a casual conversation with them .
Thus their status is about the same as that of handicraftsmen , and they are receptive to revolutionary propaganda .
In the case of peddlers , whether they carry their wares on their shoulders or set up stalls in the streets , they all have very little capital and earn meagre profit which is hardly sufficient to live on .
Their status is about the same as that of the poor peasants , and like the latter , they also need a revolution that will change the status quo .
The number of handicraftsmen is about 6 percent of the entire population , or 26 million ; there are about 5 million shop assistants and 1 million peddlers .
Combining these people with the semi @-@ owner peasants , semi @-@ tenant peasants and tenant peasants , the total number of people in the semi @-@ proletariat is about 200 million , being one @-@ half of the entire Chinese population .
Fifth , The Proletariat
The categories and the number of proletariat are as follows : industrial proletariat , about 2 million ; urban coolie labor , about 3 million , and agricultural proletariat , about 20 million .
Their combined number is about 65 million .
Because of China &apos;s backward economy , , the number of industrial workers ( the industrial proletariat ) is rather , small .
Most of the 2 million industrial workers , are found in these five kinds of industries , namely : railroads , mining , maritime transportation , textiles and shipbuilding .
Most of these industries are operated with foreign capital .
Thus , although the industrial proletariat is not numerous , it has become the main force of the national revolutionary movement .
We will realize the important position of the industrial proletariat in national revolution if we take a look at the strength that has been demonstrated by the strikes in the last 4 years , such as the seamen &apos;s strikes , the railway strike , the strikes of the Kailuan and Chiao @-@ tso coal mines , as well as the general strikes in Shanghai and Hong Kong since the 30 May Incident .
The first reason .why they have become so important is their concentration , and no other people could compare to their &quot; organized concentration . &quot; The second reason is that , with their low economic status , they would be left only with empty hands after losing their means of production .
They have no hope of making a fortune .
Meanwhile , they have been subjected to the ruthless treatment of imperialism , warlords and compradores , and consequently , they have become most adept at struggling .
The strength of the urban coolies also merits attention .
They consist mostly of dock workers and rickshamen .
Street cleaners and nightsoil movers also belong to this category .
They possess almost nothing except their hands .
Though their economic position is somewhat similar to that of industrial workers , they are not so concentrated organizationally ,
nor are they so important as a productive force .
Since there is as yet no modern capitalist agriculture in China , the so @-@ called agricultural proletariat refers to such hired peasants as hired laborer by the year , monthly hired laborer , and day laborer .
They have neither farm tools nor funds , and so they can only sell their labor to eke out a living .
Compared to other workers , they have to work longer hours , and their wages are the lowest , and there is no security of employment .
They are the most handicapped people in the villages , and occupy a position in the peasant movement that is as important as the poor peasants .
The lumpen proletariat consists of peasants deprived of land and handicraftsmen deprived of their opportunity to work .
They number some 20 million or more , and constitute the root causes of banditry and war .
The largest segment of lumpen proletariat consists of bandits , followed by soldiers , then beggars , robbers and thieves , and prostitutes .
They are most unstable in human existence .
They have their secret organizatons in China , such as the Triad Society in Fukien and Kwangtung , the Society of Brothers in Hunan , Hupei , Kweichow and Szechwan , the Big Sword Society in Anhwei , Honan and Shantung , the Rational Life Society in Chih @-@ li and the three northeastern provinces , and the Green and Red Gangs in Shanghai and elsewhere .
These secret organizations all serve as their organs of mutual aid in political and economic struggles .
The most difficult problem is how to handle these people .
The two problems of China are : poverty and unemployment .
Thus , .if the problem of unemployment is solved , it would be tantamount to solving one @-@ half of China &apos;s problems .
These people are capable of waging valiant struggle , and when they are guided properly , the can become a revolutionary force .
The above are arranged in the following table :

We can now answer the question as to who are our enemies and who are our friends .
All those who connive with imperialismwarlords and bureaucrats , compradores , big landlords , reactionary intellectualsthe so @-@ called big bourgeoisie of China , are our enemies , and our real enemies .
All petty bourgeoisie , serai @-@ proletariat and proletariat are our true friends .
As for the wavering middle bourgeoisie , its right wing should be regarded as our enemyif not now , it is not too far away .
Its left wing may be regarded as our friendbut not true friend , and we must be vigilant toward them .
Don &apos;t let them jeopardize our front !
How many true friends do we have ?
About 395 million .
How many real enemies do we have ?
About 1 million .
How many intermediate people who can either be friends or enemies ?
There are about 4 million .
Let us count these A million as our enemies so that they could have an organization of 5 million people .
It would still be impossible for them even to withstand the splitting of 395 million people !
Let the 395 million people of China unite togetherJ

NATIONAL REVOLUTION AND PEASANT MOVEMENTFOREWORD TO TNUNG @-@ MIN WEN @-@ T &apos;I TS &apos;UNG @-@ K &apos;AN&apos;
1 September 1926
&#91; Text &#93; The peasant problem is the central problem of national revolution .
Unless the peasants rise up to join and support the national revolution , the revolution will not succeed .
Unless the peasant movement is launched quickly , the peasant problem will not be solved .
Unless the peasant problem is solved to some extent in the existing revolutionary movement , the peasants will not support this revolution .
There are still many people who do not understand these reasons now , even within the revolutionary party .
They do not understand that in an economically backward semi @-@ colony , the foremost target of revolution is the rural patrimonial feudal class ( landlord class ) .
In an economically backward semi @-@ colony , both for imperialism without and the ruling class within ^ peasants are the main target of their oppression and exploitation .
In order to realize their oppression and exploitation , they must rely on the firm support of the feudal landlords .
They have no means to practice their oppression otherwise .
Thus , the rural feudal class in an economically backward semi @-@ colony is the only solid foundation for the domestic ruling class and external imperialism .
Without first shaking this foundation , it would be impossible to shake the superstructure of this foundation .
The warlords of China are chieftains of these rural feudal classes .
It is penny wise pound foolish for one to say that warlords should be overthrown , but not the rural feudal classes .
A plain example is the situation in Kwangtung : wherever the native bullies , bad gentry and corrupt bureaucrats are less active , it must be a county in which the peasant movement has been launched and there is , ; 1 mass participation of peasants in the Peasants Association .
In other words , a country where Ch &apos;en Ch * iung @-@ raing &apos;s influences have been curtailed must be a county where the peasants have risen .
It may be said that a year ago , Ch / en Ch &apos;iung @-@ mingnot the revolutionary governmentcontrolled Kwangtung .
In the past year and up to now , Kwangtung has been controlled equally by the Revolutionary Government and Ch &apos;en Ch &apos;iung @-@ mlng , although ChTen was not physically in Kwangtung himself .
From now on , the peasants must gradully stand up in the various counties in Kwangtung before it will truly show that Ch &apos;en Ch &apos;iung @-@ ming &apos;s influences are steadily diminishing there .
In Hai @-@ feng , Ch &apos;en Ch &apos;iung @-@ ming &apos;s native county , local bullies , bad gentry and corrupt bureaucrats once proliferated .
But after a Peasants Association of 50,000 farailes and 250,000 people was formed , it has become better administered than any other county in Kwangtung .
The magistrate there dared not to do evil ; tax officials dared not take bribes ; the entire country was free from bandits ; and there were no local bullies and bad gentry tyrannizing over the people .
Thus , it will be seen that the situation of Chinese revolution is like this : it is either a base of imperialism and warlords in which local bullies , bad gentry , and corrupt bureaucrats suppress the peasants , or a base of the revolutionary forces in which th &amp; -peasants rise up to suppress the local bullies , bad gentry and corrupt bureaucrats .
The Chinese revolution can be carried out only in this form and no other .
It is incumbent on all parts of China to achieve what has been done in Hai @-@ feng before it may be con @-@ sijtered revolutionary victory , and it would be nothing , otherwise .
It is incumbent on all parts of China to achieve what has been done in Hai @-@ feng before the bases of imperialism and the warlords may be said to have been really shaken .
Otherwise , it cannot be considered so .
Consequently , it will be seen that in the so @-@ called national revolutionary movement , a major part of it is the peasant movement .
Thus , it will be seen that those who do not emphasize or even abhor the peasant movement are actually sympathetic toward local bullies , bad gentry and corrupt bureaucrats .
In fact , they do not want to overthrow the warlords or to oppose imperialism .
There are people who deem that the rampancy of compradores in the cities is entirely similar to the rampancy of landlords in rural areas , and so they should be mentioned together .
This is correct in regard to their being rampant , but incorrect to say that they are completely similar .
There are only a few places in China along the sea and the rivers where the compradore class is concentrated , such as Hong Kong , Canton , Shanghai , Hankow , Tientsin and Dairen , unlike the domains of landlords which spread into various provinces and countries throughout China .
Politically , all warlords in China , big and small , are chieftains chosen by landlord class ( not including band @-@ rupt small landlords ) .
These feudal landlord chieftainsfeudal warlords make use of the urban compradore class to connive with imperialism .
Both in name and in fact , it is the warlords who occupy the principal position , while the compradore class is subordinate .
Financially , the warlord government spends several hundred million dollars annually , of which 90 percent is directly squeezed from the peasants dominated by the landlord class .
The loans made with special conditions to the Peking government by the compradore class , such as the Bankers &apos; Association , etc . , are comparatively few .
This is why I feel that the urban workers , students and middle and small merchants should rise up to attack the compradores fiercely and to cope with imperialism directly .
The progressive working class is , above all , the leader of all revolutionary classes .
However , if there are no peasants to overthrow the special privileges of patrimonial and feudal landlords in the villages , then the influences of warlords and imperialism cannot be basically destroyed .
Based on this reason , apart from organizing the workers and students , we must mobilize a large number of comrades to be resolved to undertake the gigantic work of organizing peasants .
They must make an immediate resolution to start studying peasant problems .
It is also necessary to apply for orders from the party in order to proceed to some familiar or unfamiliar villages .
This involves enduring the scorching heat of summer and the severe cold and snow of winter to hold hands with peasants , to inquire what are their hardships and what they want .
Based on their agonies and needs , we must guide them to organize , to struggle against local bullies and bad gentry , to cooperate with urban workers , students , and middle and small merchants in forming a united front , and to participate in the anti @-@ imperialist and anti @-@ warlord national revolutionary movement .
We estimate that among the 300 million peasant masses in China , if 10 percent should join Peasant Associations , it will be possible to recruit some 30 million or more organized peasants .
Especially in such provinces as Hunan , Kwangtung and Kiangsi in the south , Chihli , Shantung and Honan in the north , and Hupeh and Anhwei in central China , which are particularly important politically , mass efforts should be made in organizing .
With the rising of the peasants from these important provinces , it will be easy for peasants from the remaining provinces to follow suit .
It is only by then that the foundations of imperialism and the warlords will be shaken and a bona fide victory will be achieved by national revolution .
As we mention the studying of peasant problem , we begin to realize the insufficiency of data .
Naturally , such data will become more abundant as the peasant movement is being developed .
At present , besides Kwangtung , the peasant movement is just beginning in other provinces , and ao data are extremely scant .
This time we have just collected this much which is printed as a set of books for the references of comrades engaged in the peasant movement .
The portion concerning investigations on rural conditions in the various provinces has been written by some 300 students of the 6th class of the Peasant Movement Institute .
These reports have been discussed at the Peasant Problem Study Meetings organized by students in their respective provinces , and have been printed after a considerable period of reviewing and screening .
They have not done any detailed investigations on peasant conditions before , and so what they have told is rather sketchy .
However , because we did not even have such sketchy material , it seems precious to have this bit .
It behooves us to accept this sketchy outline with the hope that within a short period of time , it will be possible to obtain detailed and concrete investigation report on the ^ entire country from the practical work and studying in various parts of China .
In regard to the data concerning the problem of agricultural production , only five categories ( 22d @-@ 26th ) have been collected in this book .
There is no lack of materials on this problem , but because of the pressure for time in publishing it , there is not time to canvass them , but a separate publication will be issued later .
The peasant problem originally embraces the problems on two aspects , namely : the problem of man @-@ made oppression by imperialism , warlords and landlords , etc . ; and the problem of nature &apos;s oppression such as the natural disasters
of flood and drought , insect pestilences , inferior techniques and production decreases , etc .
Although the former is an urgent problem on which the attention of our comrades should be focused , the latter problem is also rather serious , and we must pay great attention to it .
In order to resolve the latter problem , it is necessary to have a nationwide revolutionary regime as well as scientific methods which , though not immediately feasible , will come soon .
We must make preparations in advance .
In this book there are eight kinds of materials concerning Kwangtung .
This is the best part of the book .
It tells us the methods of conducting the peasant movement .
Those who do not understand how to launch such movement should read this part carefully .
It also enables us to understand the character of China &apos;s peasant movement in that it is a movement of class struggle in which political and economic struggles are merged together .
What is demonstrated most uniquely is in political struggle which is somewhat different from the character of labor movement in th.e cities .
What the urban working class is striving for is the completion freedom of assembly politically .
They are not yet interested in destroying the political status of the bourgeoisie .
On the other hand , the rural peasants have , from the very outset , to cope with the political power that has for millenniums been used by local bullies , bad gentry and big landlords to oppress and squeeze them ( this landlord regime is the real basis of warlord regime ) .
Thus , unless this oppressive regime is overthrown , it will be impossible for the peasants to have their own status .
This is the most significant characteristic of China &apos;s current peasant movement .
Judging from the experiences of peasant movement in the last 5 years , and after reading &quot; The Resolution of the Peasant Conference of Kwangtung , &quot; &quot; Report on Hai @-@ feng &apos;s Peasant Movement , &quot; and &quot; The Story of Resistance of Peasants of Kwang @-@ ning and P &apos;u @-@ ning against Landlords , &quot; we cannot but have such a feeling .
This publication also includes some foreign data ( 15th to 18th ) , though not too many .
There is a wealth of materials from foreign countries , especially on Russia &apos;s peasant movement and agrarian economy , but nobody has yet translated them carefully .
In this hook , the article on Russian peasants and revolution is comparatively more detailed .
We can also compare it with the conditions in China .

THE AGONY AND RESISTANCE MOVEMENT OF PEASANTS IN KIANGSU AND CHEKIANG 25 November 1926
&#91; Text &#93; Kiangsu and Chekiang are two provinces in China where industry and commerce are highly developed .
Consequently , people pay more attention to the workers and merchants there , while the peasants seem to occupy lower position .
Moreover , it has been generally assumed that because these two provinces are peaceful and rich in resources , their peasants are better off .
In fact , this kind of interpretation is rather superficial , and it betrays a complete lack of understanding regarding the actual conditions of rural villages in Kiangsu and Chekiang .
If we should try to investigate the actual conditions , we will realize that they are completely contrary to our conjectures .
The concrete facts in each county as mentioned below constitute only a small portion of the data that we have obtained recently .
Nonetheless , this is enough to prove that the peasants in Kiangsu and Chekiang are not so peaceful , prosperous and free from agonies as the general public has imagined .
Ch &apos;ung @-@ ming : an island at the mouth of the Yangtze River , its entire territory constitutes the country of Ch &apos;ung @-@ ming .
The island was created by Yangtze River &apos;s alluvial deposits of mud and sand .
On .
the fringes of the island new sand bars are formed each year , which in turn serve as sandy fields farmed by tenant peasants .
Take Shang @-@ sha for instance .
The landlords there are extremely ruthless in exploiting tenant peasants .
They usually demand 50 yuan as security money for each 1,000 steps &#91; pu 2975 &#93; of land .
Because this kind of land consists entirely of newly formed sandy fields , the peasants have to convert it into ripe farmland for their landlords .
By then , the landlords would have -ownership over the land , while the peasants have the right to cultivate it .
However , they must secure the labor , fertilizer , farm implements , and seeds that are needed for planting each year .
After the autumn harvest , each 1,000 steps of farmland will have to deliver 500 catties or even more of grain for rent .
When the landlord comes to visit his tenant , he must be invited to a good meal and wine .
Otherwise , the rent might be increased .
The steelyard used by landlords to weigh grain delivered by tenants as rent generally takes 20 ounces for a catty .
If the peasant displays any kind of resistance , he is immediately sent to the county government for punishment .
If the peasant owes 5 yuan in rent this
year , he has to pay back 10 or 20 yuan next year .
As a result , many peasants become bankrupt each year .
The peasants here staged a riot in the llth year of the Republic .
There were no Reds or Bolsheviks to incite them , but they marched together to attack the police station , cut off the ear of a landlord by the name of T &apos;ao , and went to demonstrate at the magistrate &apos;s office , demanding reduction of rents .
Later , because of the lack of solidarity , their leader was arrested and the riot failed .
This year , Kiangsu has been hit by drought , and the harvest has declined .
At Shang @-@ sha , the harvest per 1,000 steps of land was only some 300 or 400 catties , yet the landlords insisted that their tenants deliver 500 catties of grain for rent as before .
The landlords even used the &quot; Resolution of the Tenant Maintenance Committee &quot; to deceive the peasants ( the committee was organized by landlords in 1922 to persecute the peasants ) .
Consequently , the hatred of peasants toward their landlords has intensified , and riots will soon erupt .
Chiang @-@ yin : From Wu @-@ hsi one can take the steamer to a place called Ku @-@ shan @-@ chen which is located between the three counties of Chiang @-@ yin , Ch &apos;ang @-@ shu and Wu @-@ hsi .
Big landlords abound in these three counties , and they are ruthless in oppressing tenant peasants .
Last autumn , Chou Shui @-@ p &apos;ing , a native of Ku @-@ shan who is a returned student from Japan ( Chou was a graduate of the Provincial Normal School at Wu @-@ hsi ) , returned to his own village .
He did not like what he saw , and so he persuaded the tenant peasants to set up an organization called &quot; Tenants Cooperative Society for Self @-@ salvation . &quot; Chou traveled to different villages to talk about the agonies of tenant peasants , and sometimes he became so emotional that tears fell from his eyes .
He recruited many followers from among Ku @-@ shan &apos;s peasants .
In the bordering counties of Chiang @-@ yin , Ch &apos;ang @-@ shu and Wu @-@ hsi , peasants were incited by him to rise against the evil gentry and big landlords .
They unanimously demanded that the rents be reduced .
Nevertheless , before the peasants had coalesced themselves completely , the evil gentry and big landlords had joined forces .
In Chiang @-@ yin , Ch &apos;ang @-@ shu and Wu @-@ hsi , they took action simultaneously , making their accusation by letters and by telegrams to &#91; General &#93; Sun ChTuan @-@ fang .
How could Sun Ch &apos;uan @-@ fang not listen to the charges of these evil gentry and landlords ?
Thus , in November last year , the Tenants Cooperative Society for Self @-@ salvation was dissolved and Chou Shui @-@ p &apos;ing was arrested .
Chou was executed in January this year , and so the rent reduction movement has been suppressed .
When Chou Shui @-@ p &apos;ingrB coffin was brought back to Ku @-@ shan for burial , the peasants went to his spiritual shrine in droves to kneel down .
to pay their respects .
They said : &quot; Since Mr Chou died for us , we must avenge him ! &quot; Due to a severe drought this year , the rice harvest is poor .
The peasants are again calling for rent reduction .
This proves that they are not scared by death .
They realize that it is only through solidarity and struggle that they will make the greedy landlords ease their exploitation .
In the eastern villages of Chiang @-@ yin , there is a place called Sha @-@ chou where peasant resistance against landlords has occurred .
The most sinister example here is that .the peasants are required to deliver to landlords the rent in advance .
This is what the people of Kiangsu call delivering at the time &amp; f .
Yin while planting at the time of Mou .
This is *
also one of the most awful things in the peasant economy .
The peasants there are now demanding that they pay the rent only after the crop has been hauled in , and are still struggling .
Tan @-@ yang : Described here will be two Incidents which occurred in Lu @-@ ch &apos;eng @-@ chen , Tan @-@ yang ( Lu @-@ ch &apos;eng @-@ chen is located in the eastern countryside of Tan @-@ yang near the Shanghai @-@ Nanking Railway ) .
One incident involved peasant resistance against a pawnshop which tried to cheat them , and this happened this summer .
The pawnshop at Lu &apos;ch &apos;eng @-@ chen was looted one day by the remnant soldiers under Ma Pu @-@ jen that had become bandits at Mao @-@ shan , west of Tan @-@ yang .
They did not loot too much from the pawnshop .
But in reporting the case , the proprietor of the pawnshop lied , alleging that all the pawned items , including clothes and valuables , had been looted .
In the meantime , he moved these things secretely to some hiding place .
When the peasants of nearby villages who Had pawned their belongings there heard about this trick , they went out to intercept him , recovering some of the original articles , but they could not get what had been concealed by the pawnshop .
The peasants who had pawned their things joined together to set up a &quot; Fawners &apos; Union &quot; in order to ask the pawnshop for settlement .
As a result , the pawnshop repaid some of the losses , that is , each pawner getting the amount equivalent to the pawn price , reaching 900 dollars of compensation in full settlement .
This episode proves that if the peasants are united , they will have victory .
But if they had no solidarity , then they would have been cheated by the pawnshop , losing all their pawned articles .
The other incident is resistance against the evil gentry and rich peasants who forced the tenant and poor peasants to pay money for pumping water .
This has happened in this year &apos;s summer and fall , but it has not yet been settled .
In the villages of most countries in Kiangsu , a kind of machine @-@ pumping has been generally @-@ adopted .
This is called a &quot; water @-@ pump machine &quot; which replaces the old hand and foot waterwheels to pump water .
The peasants of several villages near Lu @-@ ch &apos;eng @-@ chen have realized that it would be desirable to use machinery to pump water .
However , the evil gentry and rich peasants there took advantage of this situation to organize a &quot; Machine Pumping Company &quot; in order to make some quick profit .
They raised 1,400 yuan as capital , bought a set of machinery which was installed in the river , and issued a notice in the name of the company that the peasants who wish to pump water pay an annual fee per mou of land .
Those who do not pay would not get water .
But the peasants have also made their own calculations .
They found out that the money paid for each mou of land each year in these villages would be enough to buy a machine .
If they should raise money to buy one , they would have to pay one time only , but they could use it every year .
And if they use the company &apos;s machine , then they must pay so much each year .
Consequently , they expressed their vehement opposition to the company of evil gentry and rich peasants .
In the meantime , several primary school teachers volunteered to help the peasants in setting up an organization called &quot; Peasants Promotion Association , &quot; Under the association &apos;s sponsorship , a &quot; Machine Pumping Cooperative &quot; was formed , collecting money from its member peasants according to their acreage , raising 1,400 yuan to buy a
pumping machine .
The offshoot is there are now two pumping machines in the river , one owned by the company and the other by the cooperative .
But nobody would care to use the former which is now completely idle .
Enraged , the bad gentry made many false charges and pleaded with Sun Ch &apos;uan @-@ fang .
As a result , soldiers were sent into the countryside in search of Bolsheviks , arresting four persons , and placing three others on their wanted list .
It was further announced that those who refused to use the company &apos;s machine would be dealt with severely .
When the soldiers arrived , all able @-@ bodied men in the village hid in the tall rice stalks , leaving only the old , the women and children to confront them .
In order to avoid arrest , the accused peasants had to offer bribes to the soldiers amounting to 1,000 yuan or more .
This does not include what the latter had looted during the searches .
The case has not yet been closed .
It is gratifying that Sun Ch &apos;uan @-@ fang is now in some predicament , so the bad gentry of Lu @-@ chTeng @-@ chen might have to let it go .
Wu @-@ hsi : At Hus @-@ hang @-@ chen , about 15 li from the city of Wu @-@ hsi , a minor incident occurred recently .
Jung Te @-@ sheng , a prominent tycoon and big landlord here , attempted to build a road through the village .
Houses and farmland was condemned at low prices .
This would directly hurt the peasant economy , so the peasants formed a peasants &apos; club to oppose Jung Te @-@ sheng .
Jung capitulated , offering 200 yuan for each mou of land , and 10 cents each for the newly planted mulberry trees , and promised to stop tearing down the houses in the village .
Ch &apos;ing @-@ p &apos;u : In Ch &apos;ing @-@ p &apos;u county along the Shanghai @-@ Hangchow Railway , an incident occurred last month when peasants there opposed the sale of wasteland at inflated prices .
When peasants bought wasteland before , they used to pay 3 yuan per mou .
However , some bad gentry colluded with magistrate Lin Cheng @-@ i to form a company which obtained wasteland at 3 yuan per mou , selling it to peasants at 12 yuan .
The peasants joined together to set up a reclamation union to oppose it &gt; but they have been intimidated by the gentry as well as the bureaucrats .
The dispute is still unsettled .
T &apos;ai @-@ hsing : At Wang @-@ chia @-@ chuang in the eastern countryside , peasants demanded rent reduction because of this yearrs drought .
A violent struggle against the landlords ensued .
The landlords not only refused to reduce rents , but tried to apply pressures on the peasants .
One of the peasants became so exacerbated that he attempted to kill a notorious landlord .
The latter reported it to the magistrate , and 30 peasants were arrested and imprisoned .
T &apos;ai @-@ hsien : The peasants of Sen @-@ sen @-@ chuang , T. &apos; ai @-@ hsien , started a movement to demand rent reduction , as there was a drought in summer .
Several leaders were arrested by the government under the pressure of landlords .
Hsu @-@ chou : Among the peasants of Kiangsu , those in Hsu @-@ hai north of the Yangtze suffer the worst agonies .
The Red Spear Society and the Lien @-@ chuang Society proliferate , and rural struggles are more numerous than
elsewhere .
The terrain of the eastern and northern parts of T &apos;ung @-@ shan county being low , rice crops were submerged under water last year .
It is fortunate that the second wheat crop has been planted , and so peasants may hope to tide over the famine .
The lingering rains this fall have resulted in flooding the rice fields , and the wheat crop has deteriorated .
It is still uncertain as to when the second wheat crop can be planted .
Consequently , there is general dismay .
In the meantime , apart from natural disasters , the peasants have been plagued by the oppressions and exploitations of greedy warlords and bureaucrats .
Many peasants have degenerated and drifted to become bandits .
This is why Hsuchow and its vicinities have become known as a bandit @-@ infested area .
Tz &apos;u @-@ chfi : Tzru @-@ chfi is in Chekiang , west of Ningpo .
Recently , a big riot occurred in the Shan @-@ pei region where the peasants were sturdy and armed feuds have been recurrent .
Moreover , coupled with the unreasonable oppressions of the bureaucrats and police , and the intensified exploitations of evil gentry and landlords , the peasants have become more and more enraged and hateful .
It transpired that weather conditions have been bad this year .
Both cotton and rice harvests were poor , but the landlords refused to reduce any rent .
This has led to the eruption of a peasant riot stemming from famine .
As the riot began , it was joined immediately by the vagrant proletariat .
On the morning of 13 September , some 2,000 people gathered at the police office to report famine and they clashed with the police , setting the premises on .
fire , and seizing policemen &apos;s rifles .
The crowd then turned to the homes of the gentry and landlords to &quot; eat up the big families . &quot; They continued their rampage by destroying the antiques and furniture , windows and cabinets , and whatever they found in the latter &apos;s homes .
They did this every day and refused to desist .
Then , the villaege gentry escaped to the city to make accusations .
Soldiers and policemen were sent into the countryside to arrest the delinquent peasants , but the ringleaders had mostly fled .
&quot; Crime &quot; and &quot; violation of law &quot; have become a commonplace slogan , and the peasants lost their courage .
The riot was suppressed .
The failure of this riot has been caused -by the lack of organization and guidance among the masses .
Thus , it became a primitive riot &apos;which ended in a debacle .
HSING @-@ TAO CHOU @-@ PAO , No 176 , 25 November 1926
DECLARATION OF THE FIRST HUNAN PEASANT CONGRESS December 1926
&#91; Text &#93; Under the political and economic oppression of imperialism and feudalism , the life of the peasants grows worse day by day .
Many are &quot; without a tile over their heads or an inch of ground under their feet , &quot; truly homeless and jobless .
Ever since the power of imperialism invaded the orient destroying our &quot; closed door policy , &quot; and bursting open our agricultural economy , our Chinese peasants have become the slaves of foreign capitalists .
We labor every day to produce much grain , cotton , hemp , silk and tea and they merely produce a little cash and buy it up ; they use machines to manufacture all kinds of newfangled goods , ship them over here , and sell them for God knows how much cash .
Stuff like foreign oil , foreign cloth , foreign nails , foreign ceramics and foreign iron a limitless number of foreign goods have all flooded our cities and are gradually forcing their way into our villages .
There is no one to buy our native goods produced without machines and we can &apos;t even make a little cash by farming while the foreign goods makers get richer every day .
The way in which the imperialists exploit us is to dominate our Customs and ship in goods freely for sale at low prices , taking our silver and destroying our handicrafts industry ; it is to dominate our mines , our railroads , our waterways , to start factories and banks , using our cheap resources to make goods for themselves , and taking our coal and iron to control transportation .
The imperialists and the warlords have , moreover , colluded to exploit the peasants indirectly by imposing local taxes and the salt tax and directly through acreage tax and surtaxes .
In addition , the imperialists have made many loans to the warlords who in turn exploit the peasants even more severely in order to repay them .
The warlords also use unemployed peasants as mercenary soldiers with weapons supplied by the imperialists to create a force with which to oppress the peasants .
The imperialists exercise their money and military power and collude with the warlords and compradors and after having done this for a while in China the product of the peasants labor finds its way by twist and turn into their pockets .
The exploitation of the peasants by internal warlords and local bullies and rotten gentry is a kind of feudal exploitive system .
They do not exploit hired labor as does the capitalist but take away a large portion of the peasants &apos;producethis is the rent and tax system .
So the landlords exploit the peasants directly and indirectly ( e.g. , through the tenant peasant system ) , and so the warlords exploit them directly ( e.g. , with respect to owner @-@ peasants ) or indirectly ( e.g. , with respect to tenant peasants ) .
Every year they rake off about 60 to 65 percent of the peasants harvest .
They conspire together and coordinate with the imperialists and compradors to squeeze the peasants &apos; blood and sweat and to jointly suppress the peasants &apos; resistance .
When a drought comes and the peasants are driven to the end of their forbearance , they naturally rise up violently , often threatening the overthrow of feudalism and imperialism .
The Taiping Rebellion was an explosion of south China peasants .
The Boxer Rebellion was an explosion of north China peasants .
Both , however , were repressed by the reactionary forces of imperialism and feudalism .
But the revolutionary movement latent in peasant villages has not been dissipated by the suppression of the imperialists and feudal classes .
Such organizations as the San Ho Hui , the San Tien Hui , the Ta Tao Hui , the Ko Lao Hui which pervade the southern provinces and the Nien Tzu , the Pai Lang and the Hung Ch &apos;iang Hui in the &quot; north have been spontaneously created to struggle with the imperialists and the feudal classes .
For this reason , cases of missionaries being killed and starving peasants rioting are frequent ( the most notable in recent years being the burning of the Governor of Hunan &apos;s office in the 1908 @-@ 1911 period , and the Lin @-@ ch &apos;eng railway car hijacking case , both of which were done by these people ) .
These revolutionary organizations have no broad united front and do not understand political strategy and so can never do anything of great significance .
The organized , planned revolution by the workers of the world has given us a fine example .
Mr Sun Yat @-@ sen .and the Kuomintang which he leads got in touch with these naturally occurring revolutionary groups in the villages some 20 years ago and guided them to the path of the true political party to lead our peasant revolution .
In politics they &quot; build democracy &quot; and in economics they established &quot; equal land rights &quot; as the standards for the liberation of the peasants ; they always provided we peasants with an appropriate policy with which to fight imperialism and the feudal classes and attain our goals .
Many years ago in Heng @-@ shan and Yueh @-@ pei the peasants of Hunan began to develop organizational shoots .
Year before last during the first half of the year some of the peasants of Hsiang @-@ t &quot; an again rose up but they were massacred by the warlord Chao and could not develop successfully .
In February of last year in Chu @-@ chou Mr Wang Hsien @-@ tsung became a martyr to the peasants cause .
The violence of the warlords and local bullies reached
a peak and the peasants were in a high state of emotion .
The saying goes &quot; when things reach their worst , there must be a turn for the better . &quot; At this time a fierce campaign to drive out Chao Heng @-@ t &apos;i was born and in this .
the peasants constituted a major force .
At the time when Wu and Yeh made their counterattack , the peasants acted as spies , transport and guides for the Northern Expedition Army and disrupted the enemy &apos;s rear .
They even took up lances and birdguns and became guerrillas or joined in battles , such as at places like Li @-@ ling , Chu @-@ chou , P &apos;ing @-@ chiang and Hua @-@ jung , No less than 10 battles have had peasant participation and many peasants have been killed .
See how brave and willing to sacrifice themselves have been the Hunan peasants who have participated in the battles of the Northern Expedition !
When the Northern Expedition Army moved into Hupeh and Kiangsi and on to the Chekiang @-@ Honan front , the peasants in Hunan devoted all their efforts towards consolidating the rear , overthrowing corrupt officials and throwing out the local bullies and rotten gentry .
This movement was extremely broad .
The local bullies , rotten gentry and corrupt officials almost everywhere were utterly shocked .
No more do they dare to exercise the power and highhandedness to which they have been accustomed and treat the peasants as dirt as they did .
Since we peasants do not understand gentility or manners , we stand up straight , beat up every corrupt official , local bully and rotten gentry we hear about , not fearing that they may get together some remnants of their power for a counterattack and may kill peasants on a large scale such as at Chia @-@ ho , Lin @-@ hsiang , Yu @-@ hsien , I @-@ yang , An @-@ hua and I @-@ chang .
As these tragedies occur , we know that they are but the dying outbursts of a departing storm and we have nothing to fear .
This bit of revolutionary work , we would dare compare with the taking of the city of Wu @-@ ch &apos;ang , This is true because the power of the local bullies and rotten gentry of the villages is the true foundation of the warlords , and the destruction of this power would be difficult to accomplish without a rising by the peasants .
The primary task of the present revolutionary government should , we feel , be to continue to dig up the political foundations of the warlords and develop the organization of the masses ; we peasants will brave death to support the government as it works toward this goal .
But , the aim of the national revolution is to liberate all of the oppressed masses , not just to liberate the peasants .
How can we restrict our concern to the liberation of the peasants ?
We cannot .
But the liberation of the peasants is a pivotal point .
If the liberation of the peasants is realized , the interest of all classes is served .
At present , one of the main reasons why industry and commerce are not developed is that 300 million peasants have no purchasing power ; and the reason why agriculture is not developed is that the peasants have no productive power .
If the peasants are liberated and they can lessen the economic exploitation of the landlords they will improve agriculture and , as a result of their purchases of fertilizer , tools and cloth , industry and commerce will simultaneously develop .
In the French Revolution of years ago the peasants obtained a measure of liberation and the wealth of France was greatly increased ; in recent years the peasants of
Russia have completely done away with exploitation by landlords and their productive power increases year after year .
These are both clear proofs of this .
If industry and commerce profit by the liberation of the peasants , how much more so will education , culture and all kinds of construction .
However , the present financial difficulties of the government , the stagnant money market , the extraordinary terrorism in society and many rumors , are all blamed on the peasants and believed to be the result of the peasant revolution , How they have wronged us !
The fears of today do have causes .
One is that due to wartime blockades , rice cannot be shipped down the Yangtzu River and salt cannot be brought in to Hunan .
With this is lost all of the vast income from taxes on rice and salt sales .
Another is that finances have not been unified in western Hunan , and the Kweichow Army and other newly formed units have been syphoning off tax revenue so that one @-@ third of the financial resources of all Hunan are lost .
Another is manipulation by reactionaries , for example , the attack on the Lai @-@ yang Tax Bureau .
Although this was partially the result of corruption in the tax bureau which merited the attack , it was also the result of reactionaries taking the opportunity to create hatred among the party , government and mass organizations .
The reactionaries have done many similar things , and for these reasons they have been able to create disorder in society .
How can the disorder be attributed to the peasants ?
Although the attacks by the peasants on the local bullies and rotten gentry in the villages have used illegal methods , these are methods which must be adopted in the course of revolutionary struggle .
At a time when the East wind will overcome the West wind or be overcome by it , how can we not be severe ?
If we are afraid of conflict or adopt an attitude of doubt or negativism , we cannot be considered revolutionaries .
The old policies which did away with conflict are not suitable ; we have only the new policy established by us all , that of bringing about democratic government by the peasants in the villages and thoroughly destroying the feudal policy of the local bullies and rotten gentry .
This Congress , representing Hunan &apos;s 27 million peasants , after careful consideration , has decided upon a policy of revolutionary struggle from now on to achieve liberation .
Peasants to Hunan !
Unite under the banner of the Provincial Peasants Association and resolutely fight according to the policy of this Congress !
Our slogans are :
Peasants of China , unite !
Support the Revolutionary Government !
&apos;.Uproot corrupt officials !

Long live the First Hunan Peasants Congress !
Long live the- liberation of the Chinese people !
Long live the Peasants International !
Long live the success of World Revolution !

( B ) Peasant Participation in the Northern Expedition
( 1 ) Supply : In those places through which the Northern Expedition Army passed , the peasants were able to supply drink or small amount of food or were able to assist with such things as cooking .
( 2 ) Guides , Reconnaissance : This kind of work was done along the Chu @-@ chou P &apos;ing @-@ hsiang Rail Line , and in Liu @-@ yang , PTin @-@ chiang , Ch &apos;ang @-@ sha , Hsiang @-@ t &apos;an , Ning @-@ hsiang , Heng @-@ shan , Nan @-@ hsien and Hua @-@ jung .
( 3 ) Transport : In addition to those peasants voluntarily hired by the army , there were also organized peasants doing transportation work for the army .
( 4 ) Disrupting the enemy &apos;s rear : This took place in Hsiang @-@ t &apos;an , P &apos;ing @-@ chiang , Nan @-@ hsien , Liu @-@ yang and along the Chu @-@ chou @-@ P &apos;ing @-@ hsiang Rail Line .
( 5 ) Participation in Combat : Exact statistics are not yet available on the number of killed and wounded or the number of rifles captured .
The figures are approximately as follows :
Chu @-@ chou : The second time T &apos;ang &#91; Sheng @-@ chih &#93; &apos; s army entered Ch &apos;ang @-@ sha , the peasants and shopkeepers turned over more than 100 rifles plus some machine @-@ guns and cannon .
Li @-@ ling : When the Northern Expedition Army entered Ch &apos;ang @-@ sha , the peasants captured more than 200 rifles as well as some machine guns and cannon , and in November when troops retreating from the Kiangsi front .entered Li @-@ ling , the peasants turned over many rifles .
P &apos;ing @-@ chiang : When the Northern Expedition Army entered P &apos;ing @-@ hsiang in July , the peasants lost 25 men in combat and captured hundreds of rifles as well as machine guns .
.
In November , when the Second Division mutinied , the peasants captured some of the rebel soldiers and 250 rifles .
The government is now trying to get those rifles back , but the peasants refuse to comply , and the issue is still unsettled .
Liu @-@ yang : The peasants rescued a regiment of the Northern Expedition Army which had been surrounded and , in driving the enemy back , sustained casualties but captured some rifles .
Hua @-@ jung : When TsTai Chien &apos;s Army entered Hua @-@ jung the first time , the peasants and the troops stationed there drove them back .
The second time TsTai Chien &apos;s Army entered Hua &apos;jung , 3,000 peasants fought and repulsed it .
Yuan @-@ chiang : When Ts &apos;ai Chien &apos;s Army was attacked at Hua @-@ jung the first time , peasants from Yuan @-@ chiang participated .
Hsiang @-@ t &apos;an : The peasants acted as decoys and helped the Northern Expedition Army to cross the river and attack the enemy .
Ning @-@ hsiang : Rescued a regiment of the Northern Expedition Army which had been surrounded , and attacked the enemy and captured rifles .
Chu @-@ chou @-@ P &apos;ing @-@ hsiang Rail Line : Clashed with enemy troops and tore up tracks .
ChTang @-@ sha : Surrounded fleeing officers , and assisted the government in capturing enemy soldiers and mutineers .
( 6 ) Why the Peasants Fought
The effects of propaganda by party members .
The peasants all knew that the Northern Expedition Army supported the interests of the workers and peasants , and that only by helping the Northern Expedition Army to win could they be helped .
Hatred for northern soldiers and mercenaries .
When they compared the armies of the two sides , the hatred of the peasants was even more deep .
C , Under command of the Peasant Associations .
( A very small number were volunteers . )
The peasants were willing to fight during September and October in order to get rifles ; by that time the peasants developed a need to arm themselves .
( 7 ) The Effects of the Peasants1 Participation in the War
A. Advances in the political sense of the peasants .
B. Advances in the self @-@ confidence of the peasants .
The government was able to realize the strength of the peasants , thus favoring leftism .
( C ) Current Trends Among the Peasants
( 1 ) The peasants now feel that they should be rewarded for their contribution to the war .
Even in those counties which were not involved in the fighting , the peasants feel that the propaganda promises of the party should be fulfilled .
( 2 ) Economic demand : This kind of demand has spread throughout all of the counties that have peasant movements .
The following demands are most pervasive :
Rent reductionThere is yet no demand for total rent exemption ( land ownership granted to the peasants ) .
Interest rate reductionThe peasants are satisfied by a reduction from 8 to 9 percent to 4 to 5 percent .
A way to solve the problem of short grain supplies in lean months Resulting in a movement to refuse selling grain to government at low prices .
Tax reductionA small number of localities demand total tax exemption .
Reduce security money and stop repossessing land without causeAs yet there are no clear ideas .
These demands may be said to be minimal and are all expressed by them of their own accord .
In some areas all of these demands are made , but in some areas only one or two .
The demands of those peasants in the area of Hunan bordering on Kwangtung and Kwangsi are higher than those of the peasants of central Hunan .
( 3 ) Political Demands :
Reform the militiaThey still watch the personnel of the Militia Bureaus very closely .
Oppose the militiaIn many places the militia has lost its function and there are many instances of militia headquarters being destroyed .
i
Wish for good governmentThe political and economic demands of the peasants are all still quite naive .
Not only the peasants are uninterested in such slogans as popular election of county magistrates , but the political demands of the villages are also negative .
As far as the rumors spread by reactionaries such as &quot; confiscation of land &quot; and &quot; organization of a worker @-@ peasant government &quot; are concerned , the peasants are least interested .
( 4 ) Arms Demands : The demand of the peasants for arms grows more and more urgent .
They all want to take rifles from the hands of defeated and mutinous soldiers .
Among the peasants of P &apos;ing @-@ chiang there is a vigorous movement to keep the rifles ( see previous passages on the peasants &apos; participation in fighting ) .
( D ) Struggles Which Have Already Been Started by the Peasants ( 1 ) The rent reduction movement :
The rent reduction movement in Heng @-@ yang : The amount of rent paid by the tenant to the landlord in Heng @-@ yang is supposed to be one @-@ half of the harvest , but in actuality , the tenant cannot get as much as half .
From 1916 , due to floods and increases in education expenses , rents have gradually increased throughtout the county and , although the amount of the increase has not been uniform , there is no one who has not had his rent increased .
In this way , the amount received by the tenant is less than the amount formerly received which even then was not 50 percent .
After T &apos;ang &apos;s Army left Hunan , the peasants in Heng @-@ yang who joined the peasant associations had an urgent demand for rent reduction .
At this time they started the slogan of rent reversion throughout the whole county , or reverting to the rent levels of 5 years ago ( that is , before 1916 ) .
The result was that the whole county reverted to the rent level of 1916 .
The peasants joining the peasant association during this movement numbered about 70,000 .
At the same time , reactionary elements were united during this movement which was participated in by all peasants whether they had or had not joined the peasant association .
Rent reduction elsewhere : In addition to Heng @-@ yang , there have been scattered rent reduction campaigns elsewhere , and individual tenants have reduced rent paid to individual landlords .
Since changes in tenants or changes in land ownership almost everywhere result in increases in rent , when the increase is too much , tenants are requesting reductions .
Many of these cases are handled for the peasants by the peasant associations .
Although this is not a struggle , it increases the confidence of the peasants in the peasant associations .
Although rent reduction campaigns are a pressing need of the peasants everywhere , no struggle has occurred because the time of rent collection is past .
The opinion of most peasants is that the question of rent reduction next year will be a major struggle .
( 2 ) Interest reduction :
A general interest reduction has been successful throughout An @-@ hua County .
This has been from 7 or 8 percent per month to 4 or 5 percent .
The peasants are satisfied with this .
A campaign among some of the peasants in Yueh @-@ yang has not yet had any results , but probably will be victorious .
A demand by peasants in Hsiang @-@ yin and Niu @-@ chou for cancellation of unpaid interest has failed .
Various counties have interest reduction campaigns and none of these met with any major obstacles .
( 3 ) Reduction in security money :
A campaign throughout Liu @-@ yang County to reduce security money to 2 yuan for every picul of grain to be paid as rent has been successful .
Whether there will be problems with this in the future is difficult to tell .
In the lake region around Yueh @-@ yang , landlords wanted to increase security money to 7 yuan per picul of grain to be paid as rent and the peasants rose up in opposition .
The landlords have combined the militia of three counties to deal with this and there will be a big clash .
Various other counties have security money reduction campaigns on smaller scale .
( 4 ) Tax reduction campaigns :
Yu @-@ hsien , Li &apos;ling and I @-@ chang all have tax reduction campaigns .
An @-@ hsiang has eliminated the acreage tax throughout the county but has increased the land surtax .
In Yueh @-@ yang , some of the peasant campaigns which have been demanding the abolition of the acreage tax have come into conflict with the militia and nothing has been resolved .
( 5 ) Land reclamation campaigns : The peasants of An @-@ hua demand that no rent be collected from coarse grain sown during the winter months .
Some have succeeded and others are still in dispute .
( 6 ) The question of restrictions on normal grain sales :
The cause : Hunan has had droughts for many years in succession .
When the dry months come , the villages are short of grain or the price of grain skyrockets , and this has caused the peasants to carry out a movement to restrict grain sales .
This movement is carried out in 7 or 8 out of 10 places where there is a peasant organization , in the following manners :
A decision on the price of grain is made by the peasant association or the peasant assembly to forbid selling grain at a higher price .
Two or three grain prices are set and certain kinds of people are made to pay certain prices .
Restrictions are placed on the amount of grain or rice to be transported outside . :
Grain and rice are totally prohibited from being transported outside .
No price is set for grain until a drought occurs .
i
Several tenths of the rental grain are withheld ,
The conflicts caused by this struggle :
Boycotts : If landlords do not sell grain they are forced to sell , or even fined or beaten .
Secret sales : If secret sales are discovered , the grain is confiscated or the owner fined .
Conflicts arise out of disputes on grain prices .
Effects : The landlords and businessmen dislike these campaigns intensely while the landowning peasants and tenant farmers donTt want them either , and since the government is urging the remission of land @-@ tax and the landlords are complaining that they can &apos;t sell their grain , the government is quite dissatisfied also .
The policy of the provincial peasants association is that only a portion of rental grain will be permitted to be withheld as a reserve for sales at reasonable prices during drought seasons and that unlimited boycotts are not allowed .
This campaign has , however , already been accepted by the masses and it will be hard to change for a while .
( 7 ) Conflicts with the militia :
The Chief of the Militia Bureau in Ning @-@ hsiang ( and the branch Bureaus in the townships ) are all elected by the township assemblies and , in those places where there is a peasant association , the peasants pay close attention to the persons elected .
Yueh @-@ yang :
The Militia Bureau prohibited the peasants from meeting and there was a clash .
After petition by the peasants , the Militia Bureau was disbanded .
The peasants clashed with the Militia Bureau over acreage tax , and this issue has not yet been settled .
In two clashes with the militia , more than 10 peasants were shot to death .
The Chiaho militia has shot some peasants to death .
In.Kuei @-@ yang , reactionary elements conspired with the militia to send troops into the city to disband the peasant association .
In Tzu @-@ hsing , the militia forced a reorganization of the peasants association .
In a fight between the peasants of Hsiang @-@ t &apos;an and the militia , one peasant was shot to death .
In Niu @-@ chou ( Yueh @-@ yang ) the militia prohibited the peasants from organizing an association .
There have been many conflicts in various places between peasants and the militia and , in most cases , the militia has won .
( 8 ) Conflicts with the local bullies and rotten gentry :
It may be said that conflicts between the peasants and local bullies and rotten gentry are occurring everywhere all the time .
The attacks of the local bullies and rotten gentry upon the peasants are worsening every day .
The peasants have retorted with assault and battery , prosecution , parade , fine and expulsion .
Of course most of these are resulted from attacks by them upon the peasants and this has aroused the hatred of the masses .
( E ) The State of Local Government
( 1 ) In some townships , the peasants association has taken over the government .
( 2 ) Township assemblies exist in many counties and act as the highest legislative organization of the township .
In a few counties , the Chief of the Militia Bureau and the county magistrate are elected by the township assemblies .
( 3 ) In a few localities the peasant association , the teachers union , the Chamber of Commerce , and the workers unions have united and taken over the government of the township .
( 4 ) In .many localities , township government is in the hands of the Kuomintang Party Headquarters and they sympathize with or support the peasant movement .
( 5 ) In most localities , the government is still controlled by the local bullies and rotten gentry in order to oppress the peasants .
In places where there are peasant associations , clashes occur frequently .
( F ) Peasant Self @-@ Defense Organizations
( 1 ) Each county in Hunan has organized neighborhood defense units as advocated by T &apos;ang Sheng @-@ Chih .
Although the leadership of these organizations is in the hands of the gentry and the landlords , the members and lower level officers are all peasants .
In places where there is a peasants association , these units become organizations of the peasants without trouble .
The units do not have rifles , but do have lances ( a dagger attached to a long pole ) , birdguns and swords .
Most have regular drills , for which participants are paid ( 500 wen each ) .
The counties in the central Hunan area around P &apos;ing @-@ chiang , Liu @-@ yang and Ch &apos;ang @-@ sha have this kind of organization but it is not widespread , and there is no drill pay .
In the recent fighting and in resisting bandits , they have been of great use .
There are no statistics on their organization and membership .
( 2 ) With the exception of the neighborhood defense units , the peasants of Hunan have no other self @-@ defense organization .
Although there was once a Peasant Self @-@ Defense Army , and Self @-@ Defense Regiments , these have been discontinued because their operating expenses could not be met .
( 3 ) In such places as P &apos;ing @-@ chiang , An @-@ hua , Li @-@ ling and Hsiang @-@ t &apos;an , the peasants have captured a few rifles ( P &apos;ing @-@ chiang has 250 , and there are problems yet to be solved ) which can be brought out for use by the peasants in their own defense .
( G ) Measures Adopted by the Local Bullies and Rotten Gentry to Undermine the Peasant Movement
The local bullies and rotten gentry are gradually united with all other reactionary forces .
They attack the peasants in the following ways :
( 1 ) They secretly organize such groups as the Protect the Rich League , the Protect Property League and the White League .
They publicly organize the League of District Magistrates and the Township League .
( 2 ) They clamor that the peasant association is going to institute conscription and tolls and , that when Wu P &apos;ei @-@ fu comes he will cut their heads off , in order to frighten the peasants and keep them from joining the association .
( 3 ) They clamor that the peasant association is communist and will institute a so @-@ called 3 @-@ 3 @-@ 1 system .
( 4 ) They organize fake peasant associations and publish proclamations advocating a so @-@ called 3 @-@ 3 @-@ 1 system .
( 5 ) They infiltrate .the peasant associations in order to usurp their leadership .
Failing to do so , they make trouble .
( 6 ) By means of bribery , sedition , promotion of homeland viewpoint , religious thinking and superstition , they incite the peasants to oppose the peasant association .
( 7 ) They infiltrate the Kuomlntang to oppress the peasants and manipulate the peasant associations .
( 8 ) They clamor that the Northern Expedition Army has failed .
( 9 ) They collude with Chao and Sun of the Kuomintang right wing .
( 10 ) Masquerading rioting peasants they destroyed the Tax Bureau in order to cause people to lose their sympathy for the peasants movement .
( 11 ) They use the militia to directly oppress and kill the peasants , and disband peasant associations .
They have done such sabotage in a somewhat coordinated way .

LATEST DIRECTIVE OF NATIONAL PEASANT ASSOCIATION 13 June 1927
&#91; Text &#93; Because of the overly fast development of the peasant movement in the past , it has not been perfect organizationally .
Coupled with the fierce counterattack of the local despots and evil gentry , this caused the rural struggle to become more and more severe .
Unorganized actions have occurred whenever the superior organs failed to point out all possibilities .
This association has instructed the peasant associations at all levels to make rectifications , so that the peasants in all places could , under the direction of the Peasant Association , continue to struggle against the reactionary feudal forces of all local despots and evil gentry with organization and planning , to fulfill the responsibility of overthrowing the economic base of the imperialist exploitation in the countryside and the political base of the warlords &apos; domination in the revolution .
It has also been pointed out that the present struggle goal should be to establish rural self @-@ government by the peasants everywhere .
According to reports from all quarters , the attack by local despots and evil gentry in the three provinces of Hunan , Kiangsi and Hupeh has been most vicious , as more than 10,000 party members , peasants and workers have been killed .
A sinister plot to incite revolutionary soldiers against the peasants is being pushed .
They have often fabricated facts by calling a deer a horse , and exaggerated things in the hope of provoking the soldiers to clash with mass organizations , thereby alienating the army and the people , splitting the united front and sabotaging the Three Great Policies , in order to overthrow the party and the country .
They would have no regret even though this would aggravate the agonies of the people and bring about national destruction .
In the meantime , the corrupt bureaucrats have connived with the local despots and evil gentry in smearing the peasants , hoping to alienate the government from the people .
For instance , .the Peasant Association of Huang @-@ kang has never tried to destroy tobacco crops , but the corrupt bureaucrats made a false report to the Central Government which disbanded the association .
This is a case in point .
Now , the Military Affairs Committee of the National Government has learned of the vicious plan of imperialism , warlords , corrupt bureaucrats , local despots and evil gentry , compradores and all the reactionary forces to unleash a concerted attack on the National Government just as our armies
are launching the northern expedition against the Fengt &apos;ien armed forces .
It has therefore issued a directive to all armed comrades that they should not listen to false accusations and exaggerated propaganda .
In order not to fall into a trap of the reactionaries , they should limit their actions to making investigations only .
Nonetheless , the slaughtering of peasants by local despots and evil gentry in conjunction with bandits and stragglers in the various cities have become more and more serious recently .
Numerous instances have occurred in which conspiracies were hatched by corrupt bureaucrats to undermine relations between the government and the people .
The various organs have received several cases of false accusations against peasants everyday .
Under these circumstances , the peasant associations at all levels should request that the National Government ( 1 ) issue a directive to protect workers &apos; organizations , workers &apos; pickets , and the peasants self @-@ defense army , and punish the reactionaries that slaughtered workers and peasants and sabotaged the rear , in order that such revolutionary organs as the trade union , peasant association and CP may have complete freedom to rally the revolutionary forces and to launch an anti @-@ Chiang expedition ; ( 2 ) liquidate the local despots and evil gentry in the various counties in Hupeh who connived with enemy soldiers and bandits to slaughter peasants and workers , and severely punish Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s agents and all reactionaries who spread divisive rumors in order to consolidate Wuhan ;
( 3 ) issue a directive to punish Hsu K &apos;o @-@ hsiang &#91; 6079 0344 4382 &#93; , Ch &apos;ou Ao &#91; 0092 7663 &#93; , P &apos;eng Kuo @-@ chun &#91; 1756 0948 6874 &#93; and Hsiao.Yu @-@ k &apos;un &#91; 5618 5038 2492 &#93; and dissolve such reactionary organs as the Party Salvation Committee and Party Purification Committee , restore the Hunan Provincial Government , Provincial Party Committee , Provincial Trade Union and Provincial Peasant Association as well as all revolutionary organizations that have been destroyed , accept the petition of the Hunan Petition Group , and instruct T &apos;ang Sheng @-@ chih &#91; 0781 3932 2535 &#93; , chairman of Hunan provincial government , to take immediate action to suppress the reactionaries in Hunan ; and
( 4 ) issue a directive to stop all actions in Kiangsi to oust the CP and worker and peasant leaders , as well as to severely punish the reactionaries who slaughtered the masses .
It is incumbent on the Peasant Association itself to redouble its efforts to rally the peasants , tighten up the organization , and carry out armed self @-@ defense in order to resist the armed attacks of local despots and evil gentry as well as to suppress the provocations by all reactionary and feudal forces .
This is necessary because if the local despots and evil gentry are not suppressed , it will be impossible to establish rural self @-@ government and democratic power , nor the realization of economic construction , while the foundation of the National Government will never be consolidated .
This directive is issued by the standing members of the Provisional Executive Committee of the National Peasant Association of China : TTan Yen @-@ k &apos;ai &#91; 6223 1693 7065 &#93; , TTan P &apos;ing @-@ shan &#91; 6223 1627 1472 &#93; , Teng Yen @-@ ta &#91; 6772 3348 6671 &#93; , Mao Tse @-@ tung and Lu Ch &apos;en &#91; 7120 3089 &#93; , 13 June .
LETTER FROM HUNAN TO CENTRAL COMMITTEE 20 August 1927
&#91; Text &#93; ( 3 ) A certain comrade who has arrived in Hunan said that the Comintern has isstted a new directive suggesting that the worker @-@ peasant @-@ soldier soviet be implemented immediately in China .
We have been very heartened by this news .
Although objectively speaking , China has reached the 1917 era , we deemed before that it was still in 1905 , which was a great mistake .
The soviet of workers , peasants and soldiers is completely in keeping with the objective conditions .
We should have the resolve to set up a worker , peasant and soldier soviet regime in the four provinces of Kwangtung , Hunan , Hupeh and Kiangsi .
With the establishment of such a regime , we must , henceforth , .
rapidly achieve nationwide victory .
We hope that the Central Committee will unhesitatingly accept this Comintern directive and implement it immediately in Hunan .
In view of the fact that this new directive of the Comintern is bound to affect our attitude toward the Kuomintang , as soon as we set up the soviet regime of workers , peasants and soldiers , we can no longer carry the Kuomintang flag .
We should hoist high the flag of the Chinese Communist Party vis @-@ a @-@ vis the Kuomintang flag that has been hoisted by such warlords as Chiang Kai @-@ shek , T &apos;ang Sheng @-@ chih , Yen Hsi @-@ shan and Feng Yu @-@ hsiang .
The Kuomintang flag has been the flag of warlords for some time now and so only the communist flag is the flag of the people .
When we were in Hupeh , we did not understand this too well .
But after being in Hunan for a few days , we have seen how the people regard the provincial party headquarters under T &apos;ang Sheng @-@ chih , thus realizing that we really cannot fly the Kuomintang flag any longer or we are bound to be defeated .
Previously , we have failed to seek actively the Kuomintang &apos;s leadership power , but allowed Wang Ching @-@ wei , Chiang Kai @-@ shek , T &apos;ang Sheng @-@ chih , etc . , to seize it .
Now , we should return this flag to them , because it has become a black flag completely .
On our part , we must resolutely fly the red flag .
As for the petty bourgeoisie , we must keep them under the leadership of the red flag , and objectively , they must be placed entirely under the leadership of the red flag .
( 4 ) Land Problem : From my recent investigation on peasant problems in the two rural areas of ChTing @-@ t &apos;ai @-@ hsiang , in Changsha and Shao @-@ shan , in
Hsiang @-@ t &apos;an ( from where five peasants have come to the provincial capital ) , I realize that it is the consensus of peasants that their agrarian problem must be resolved completely .
Yesterday , I talked with several peasant comrades from the countryside to consult their views .
As a result , I have drafted the following outlines :
( a ) Confiscate all land , including &#91; that belonging to &#93; small landlords and owner @-@ peasants , and nationalize it .
Land would then be redistributed to all country people who wish to obtain land equitably on these two standards by the peasants association ; in accordance with &quot; working ability1 &apos; and &quot; consumption &quot; ( that is , in keeping with the actual amount of consumption by each family ) .
( b ) In redistributing land , the district peasants association should order the township peasants association to compile a census register , to be handed over to the district association for redistribution of land accordingly .
( c ) In redistributing land , the district , rather than township , should be used as the unit ; in a township where there is greater population than land , it can be transferred to a township where there are fewer people but more land .
It is only thus that redistribution will be equitable .
Temporarily , it won &apos;t be possible for people to move from one district to another .
( d ) After the land has been confiscated , measures must be provided to settle the families of landlords ( whether they are big landlords or not ) in order to pacify the people .
There should be four classes : class 1 , 4 percent collection ; class 2 , 3 percent collection ; class 3 , 2 percent collection , and class 4 , 1 percent collection .
This draft proposal has been discussed at the provincial committee meeting yesterday .
We must canvass the views of more peasants before we will ask you to make the final decision .
The draft is submitted to you for references of discussion , ( abridged ) 20 August

LETTER FROM HUNAN PROVINCIAL COMMITTEE 30 August 1927 .
&#91; Text &#93; Brother X X :
Your letter of Character Hsiang No 5 has been.received.
Concerning the two points of error mentioned therein , what you have said is not in keeping with either fact or theory .
We wish , therefore , to reply to you as follows :
( 1 ) From the standpoint of the revolutionary significance as a whole , to capture Changsha and to stage the Autumn Harvest uprising are both for the purpose of promoting agrarian revolution .
The Changsha uprising and the Autumn Harvest uprising are the same thing .
Whereas the Changsha uprising serves as the starting point of the Autumn Harvest uprising , the Autumn Harvest uprising is to unleash an agrarian revolution in order to seize political power .
In OUT plan to capture Changsha , the main fighters are workers and peasants .
The purpose of transferring the two X and X regiments to attack Changsha is to supplement the insufficiency in strength of the workers and peasants .
They are not the main force , but are deployed to serve as a cover for the development of the uprising , and so they are not the only important element of the uprising .
Your committee has deemed that this is a military adventure here , ordering that the plan for the Changsha uprising be canceled .
This shows your ignorance about the conditions here , and it is a contradictory policy in which no attention is paid to military affairs , but in the meantime , it calls for an armed uprising on the part of the masses .
( 2 ) You have said that we have been paying attention here only to our work in Changsha , and neglected the other places .
This is not true .
It is true that we have been amiss in reporting to you the situation in other places where considerable preparations have been made ( please see the plan on the uprising in central Hunan ) .
In regard to the problem of our work in southern Hunan , we must also explain that making Changsha the starting point of the uprising does not mean that we have given up southern Hunan .
The reason why we have not made Heng @-@ yang the second starting point is because our strength is only sufficient to stage uprisings in central Hunan .
If there should be uprisings in the various counties , our strength will be so diffused that it will be impossible to implement the plan of uprising
in central Hunan .
That is why we decided against making Heng @-@ yang the second starting point .
Nonetheless , where plans for uprising have been made and preparations are underway in the various counties in southern Hunan , we have already issued orders to them to carry out the uprisings effectively .
As soon as the Changsha uprising begins , it will be unleashed simultaneously in the other counties .

REPORT OF THE CHING @-@ KANG MOUNTAINS FRONT COMMITTEE TO CENTRAL AUTHORITY 25 November 1928
&#91; Text &#93; To the Central Committee in care of the Hunan Provincial Committee : ( 1 ) Concerning the Letter From Central Committee
The 4 June letter from the Central Committee , after passing through the Kiangsi Provincial Committee and the Chi @-@ an County Committee , only arrived at the Ching @-@ kang Mountains on 2 December .
Very well written , this letter has rectified many of our mistakes and resolved many controversial problems here .
Upon its receipt , this letter was forwarded to the army committee as well as to local committees at all levels .
On 6 November , the units heading toward Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan were concentrated at Ching @-@ kang Mountains , and some 30 persons including members of the Special Committee and the army &apos;s and local active elements ( such as Chu Teh , Ch &apos;en I , Ho T &apos;ing @-@ yin &#91; 0149 2185 7336 &#93; , Ho Ch &apos;ang @-@ kung &#91; 0149 7022 &#93; , Yuan Wen @-@ ts &apos;ai &#91; 5913 2429 2088 &#93; , Wang Tso &#91; 3769 0146 &#93; , T &apos;an Chen @-@ lin &#91; 6223 7201 2651 &#93; , Teng Kan @-@ yuan &#91; 6772 1626 0337 &#93; , Li Chueh @-@ fei &#91; 2621 6748 7236 &#93; , Ch &apos;en Cheng @-@ jen &#91; 7115 2973 0066 &#93; , Wang Tso @-@ nung &#91; 3769 0146 6593 &#93; , Hsiao Fang @-@ hsia &#91; 5618 5502 0704 &#93; , Liu Hui @-@ ch &apos;ing &#91; 0491 6540 7230 &#93; , Hsieh Ch &apos;un @-@ piao &#91; 6200 2504 2871 &#93; , Liu Ti &#91; 6491 2420 &#93; , Hsiung Shou @-@ ch &apos;i &#91; 3574 4388 &#93; , Yang K &apos;ai @-@ ming &#91; 2769 7030 2494 &#93; , Ts &apos;ao Shuo &#91; 2580 7007 &#93; , Teng Chiu @-@ t &apos;ing &#91; 6772 0036 6599 &#93; , Mao Tse @-@ tung , Sung Ch &apos;iao @-@ sheng &#91; 1345 0829 3932 &#93; , P &apos;eng Fu &#91; 1756 4375 &#93; , and Yuan Te @-@ sheng &#91; 5913 1795 3932 &#93; representing the Hunan Provincial Committee ) attended a meeting held by the Special Committee to discuss the letter from the Central Committee .
The consensus was that with the exception of one or two specific points ( such as the guerrilla area being too broad and the abolition of the party representative system ) , all principles and policies are practicable and should be carried out accordingly .
The highest organ of the party is also the front committee .
According to the letter , when the front committee is in Kiangsi , it is under the direction of the Kiangsi Provincial Committee , and when it is moved into Hunan , it should be then under the director of the Hunan Provincial Committee .
What is regrettable is that among the four attached documents in the Central Committee letter , we have translated only
the two documents on &quot; Confiscation of Land To Set Up Soviets &quot; and &quot; The February Resolution of the Comintern , &quot; while the two on &quot; Military Works &quot; and &quot; Organizational Problems &quot; cannot be translated .
The last two items are urgently needed .
Please tell us about the method of translation or send us .
another copy .
( 2 ) Border Regimes and the August Defeat
China is the only country in the world today where one or more small areas under a Red Regime have emerged in the midst of a white regime encircling them .
When we analyze the cause of this phenomenon it will be seen that it is due to the continuous conflicts and wars among China &apos;s compradores and powerful gentry .
As long as the conflicts and wars between these two classes continue , the existence and development of the armed entrenchment by workers and peasants will also continue .
Where there are continued conflicts and wars between compradores and the powerful gentry , the existence and development of a soviet regime must have the following prerequisites : ( 1 ) excellent masses , ( 2 ) a sound party , ( 3 ) a large , strong Red army , ( 4 ) terrain favorable to waging war , and ( 5 ) economic power for self @-@ sustenance ,
Moreover , the strategy adopted by the border areas vis @-@ a @-@ vis the surrounding ruling classes should vary , depending on whether the political power of the ruling class is stable or in a state of disruption .
For instance , when there was disruption in the ruling class , such as during the war between Li Tsung @-@ jen and T &apos;ang Sheug @-@ chih in Hunan and Hupeh , and the war in Kwangtung between Chang Fa @-@ k &apos;uei and Li Chi @-@ shen , we could be more venturesome in our military strategy , and the area of our military occupation could be expanded .
Nonetheless , attention must be paid to setting up a firm bastion in the central areas to serve as an impregnable bulwark when the White terror descends on us .
Where the ruling class is ( comparatively ) stable , such as in the southern provinces since April of this year , we should follow a strategy of gradual advance .
Militarily , what is most undesirable is to divide the forces for adventurous advances ; in mass work ( such as distribution of land , establishment of Soviets , organization of party and local militia ) , what is most undesirable is the diffusion of manpower , instead of paying attention to lay a sound foundation for the central areas .
The defeat of the small Soviets in China has been due either to the lack of objective prerequisites or to subjective errors in tactics .
The reason why there have been errors in subjective tactics is because of the failure to differentiate the two different stages of the ruling classwhen their regime is stable , and when their regime is in disruption .
When the political power of the ruling class is stable , some advocate that the armed forces be divided to make adventurous advances ; they even advocate that the Red Guards alone be deployed to defend extensive soviet regime areas , as though ignorant of the fact that the enemy , apart from utilizing the house @-@ to @-@ house levies , is also capable of using regular forces for concentrated operations .
In mass work , no attention was paid to laying a firm foundation in the central areas , and , disregarding the potentials of our capacity , .they attempted unrestricted expansion .
If anyone advocated a policy of gradual military advance , and the concentration of manpower in the mass work in order to set up a solid
foundation in the central areas , to achieve an invincible position , it would be dubbed &quot; conservatism . &quot; This is the basic reason for the .
August defeat in the border areas and the failure of the Red Army in Hunan .
The border area work started in October last year .
At the beginning , there
was no party organization whatsoever in the various counties , and the local
militia.consisted only of some 60 old rifles possessed by Wang Tso and
Yuan Wen @-@ ts &apos;ai each in the vicinity of the Ching @-@ kang Mountains .
The rifles
of the peasant Self @-@ defense Corps of the four counties of Yung @-@ hsin , Lien ~ hua ,
Ch &apos;a @-@ ling and Ling @-@ hsien have already been surrendered to the powerful .
gentry , with the result that the revolutionary ardor of the masses has been
suppressed .
By February of this year , county committees had been set up in
Ning @-@ kang , Yung @-@ hsin , Ch &apos;a @-@ ling and Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan ; a special district committee
was created in Ling @-@ hsien .
Party organization has also been under way in
Lien @-@ hua , which has developed relations with the Wan @-@ an committee .
Except
for Ling @-@ hsien , all the counties had a few local armed forces .
In Ning @-@ kang ,
Ch &apos;a @-@ ling , Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan and Yung @-@ hsin , especially in the two counties of
Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan and Yung @-@ hsin , considerable work has been done in unleashing the
masses in guerrilla uprisings to kill the landlords , with much success .
During this stage , the agrarian revolution has not yet been intensified ,
and the names used for the organs of political power were &quot; Workers , peasants
and soldiers * representatives &apos; committee &quot; and the &quot; people &apos;s committee . &quot;
They were known simply as the Government of the Workers , Peasants and Soldiers ,
without the title of soviet .
Soldiers &apos; committees were organized in the army , and
salary system abolished .
When guerrillas were on active duty , action committees
were organized to direct them .
These simple measures have been adopted
partly by improvization , and partly on the basis of the announcement ( such as
the people &apos;s committees ) of the 11 December uprising in Kwangtung which was
reported in the newspapers .
This is because we have lost contact with the
provincial committee since November , thus becoming completely uninformed
about all party policies .
It was only in April this year that the resolution
of the enlarged conference of the Central Committee in November which was
so significant in China &apos;s revolutionary history was brought from Hunan to
the border areas by Comrade Chu Teh and others .
It was also then that the
impact of the resolution has reached the party organization in the border
area .
The leading organ then was the Front Committee ( of which Mao Tse @-@ tung
was secretary ) appointed by the Hunan Provincial Committee during the Autumn
Harvest Uprising .
Early in March , the Front Committee was abolished at the
suggestion of the Hunan Special Committee and reorganized as the Divisional
Committee ( with Ho T &apos;ing @-@ ying as secretary ) .
It thus became a party organ
for the army only and had no jurisdiction over the local party and was
fraught with shortcomings .
Meanwhile , at the suggestions of the Southern
Hunan Special Committee , Mao Tse @-@ tung &quot; s units were transferred to Hunan ,
and for more than a month the border area was abandoned .
At the end of
March came the defeat in Hunan .
The units of Chu Teh and Mao Tse @-@ tung , as
well as the peasant troops in southern Hunan , retreated to Ning @-@ kang in
April , thereby reoccupying the border area .
After April , occupation of the Hunan @-@ Kiangsi border area was effected at a time when the ruling power in the southern provinces was enjoying comparative stability .
They were able to send out any time some 8 to 9 regiments and sometimes as many as 18 regiments from Hunan and Kiangsi for their suppression campaign .
Yet , with fewer than four regiments of our own troops , we engaged the enemy for 4 months , while the occupied areas expanded , the agrarian revolution was intensified , the soviet organization was promoted , and the Red Army and Red Guards grew in number and strength steadily .
The reason for this is that the policy of the party in the border area ( both local party and army party ) was correct .
At that time , the policies of the Border Special Committee ( with Mao Tse @-@ tung as secretary ) and the Army Committee ( with Ch &apos;en I as secretary ) were : To struggle resolutely against the enemy in order to establish political power in the middle section of Lo @-@ hsiao Mountains and to oppose any defeatist flightism ; to intensify agrarian revolution in the occupied areas ; the army &apos;s party organization should help develop the local party , and the regular army should help develop the local militia forces ; to be on the defense in Hunan where the ruling power is stronger , and to be on the offense in Kiangsi where the ruling power is weaker ; devote great effort to develop Yung @-@ hsin in order to create a regime of the masses , and to prepare for a protracted struggle ; to concentrate the Red Army with a view to attacking the enemy confronting them at the proper time , and to oppose dispersion of armed forces in order to avert the danger of being destroyed individually ; to adopt the tactic of expanding the areas under the regime by wave @-@ like advances , and to oppose the policy of adventurist advance .
Thanks to the correctness of these tactics , coupled with the topography of the border area which was most favorable to our struggle , as well as the fact that the attacking troops from Hunan and Kiangsi were badly coordinated , we were able to win military victories during the 4 months from April to July and insure the expansion of the masses &apos; regime .
Although the enemy outnumbered us by several times , he failed to destroy the regime which was expanding steadily .
The impact of the regime was increasingly felt in the two provinces of Hunan and Kiangsi .
The August defeat was due solely to our ignorance of the fact that it was a time when the ruling class was relatively stable .
We adopted the kind of policy that was geared to a ruling class facing disruption .
Thus , in dividing our armed forces to make adventurous advance in southern Hunan , we incurred defeats in the border area and in southern Hunan as well .
Tu Hsiu @-@ ching &#91; 2629 0208 4842 &#93; , representative of the Hunan Provincial Committee , and Yang K &apos;ai @-@ ming , secretary of the Special Committee appointed by the Hunan Provincial Committee , carried out perfunctorily the orders of the Hunan Provincial Committee , taking advantage of the absence of such persons as Mao Tse @-@ tung and Wan Hsi @-@ hsien &#91; 5502 0341 2009 &#93; who were then in Yung @-@ hsin and had objected to the orders strongly , without canvassing the situation then and disregarding the resolutions of the joint conference of the Army Committee , Special Committee and Yung @-@ hsin County Committee which differed from the views of the Hunan Provincial Committee .
They also endorsed the action of the 29th regiment ( I @-@ chang peasants ) to abandon the struggle to return home .
The result was to bring about defeat both in the border area and in southern Hunan , thus making a tremendous mistake .
In the middle of July , the Eighth Army mounted an attack on the Kiangsi border , but it was unsuccessful .
As the bulk of the Red Army launched an offensive against Ling @-@ hsien and Ch &apos;a @-@ ling , and was changing its plans to turn to southern Hunan , five , regiments commanded by Wang Chun &#91; 3769 0971 &#93; and Chin Han @-@ ting &#91; 6855 3351 7844 &#93; in Kiangsi , and six regiments under Hu Wen @-@ t &apos;ou &#91; 5170 2429 2435 &#93; , of the 6th Army , 11 regiments in all , laid siege to Yung @-@ hsin .
We had only one regiment ( commanded by Mao Tse @-@ tung ) in Yung @-@ hsin which , shielded by the broad Red masses and resorting to guerrilla tactics on all sides , succeeded in pinning down these 11 enemy regiments within 30 li of the city for 25 days .
Finally , the enemy probed our weakness and captured Yung @-@ hsin by a fierce assault , and its loss was followed by Lien @-@ hua and Ning @-@ kang .
At that time , some internal bickering flared up in the 6th Army , which withdrew suddenly and engaged Wang Chun &apos;s units at Chang @-@ shu .
Only five Kiangsi regiments were left , and , panicked , they withdrew into the city of Yung @-@ hsin .
Thus , if our main force had not gone to southern Hunan , it would undoubtedly , with the help of the masses , have routed this enemy force , and extended the .regimes areas to include Chi @-@ an , An @-@ fu and P &apos;ing @-@ hsiang , and linked it up with P &apos;ing @-@ chiang and Liu @-@ yang .
But as the main force was away and the one remaining regiment was too exhausted and worn out , we decided to keep part of it to defend the Ching @-@ kang Mountains , together with the two units under Yuan Wen @-@ ts &apos;ai and Wang Tso , while ordering Mao Tse @-@ tung to lead one battalion to Kuei @-@ tung to meet the main force and escort it back .
By that time , the main force , which had started toward southern Hunan , was retreating to Kuei @-@ tung , and the forces joined at Kuei @-@ tung on 23 August .
!
i .
The ! Sth Army under Wu Shang &#91; 0742 1424 &#93; had invaded Ning @-@ kang and again advanced into Yung @-@ hsin .
Our enemy from Hunan was anxious to fight but could not ( as our army missed his troops when we attacked from a side road ) .
Fearing harassment by our masses , his array then retreated to Ch &apos;a @-@ ling by way of Lien @-@ hua .
Just one day later , 11 regiments of our Kiangsi enemy moved into Yung @-@ hsin .
At that time , the main force of the Red Army ( led by Chu Teh ) was attacking Ch &apos;a @-@ ling and Ling @-@ hsien from Ning @-@ kang , Upon reaching Ling @-@ hsien , the soldiers of the 29th Regiment , seized by deep homesickness , demanded to go back to Hunan and refused to take orders .
Another segment of our array was opposed to going back to southern Hunan , because they wanted to go to southern Kiangsi , and were also unwilling to turn to attack the enemy in Yung @-@ hsin .
Their agitation was aided by Tu Hsiu @-@ ching , and even the Army Committee was helpless in averting this unfavorable turn of events .
Consequently , the main force set out from Mien @-@ tu in Ling @-@ hsien on 17 July , moving toward Ch &apos;en @-@ chou via Tzu @-@ hsing .
On 24 July a battle was fought against Fan Shih @-@ sheng &apos;s &#91; 5400 4258 3932 &#93; units at Ch &apos;en @-@ chou .
Initial success was followed by defeat .
It was dusk when we withdrew and we took the wrong road .
The 29th Regiment hurried toward I @-@ chang ; a part of it was annihilated by Hu Feng @-@ chang &apos;s &#91; 5170 7685 4545 &#93; men at Lo @-@ ch &apos;ang , while another part was scattered and lost in I @-@ chang and Ch &apos;en @-@ chou .
Only some 100 rifles were recovered and assembled that night , though fortunately the loss sustained by the main force was small .
Kuei @-@ tung was occupied on 18 August , On 23 August .Mao Tse--tung and others arrived from the Ching @-@ kang Mountains , and it was decided to return to Ning @-@ kang .
That afternoon , two regiments of Wu Shang &apos;s troops in Ling @-@ hsien launched a sharp attack on Kuei @-@ tung and a hard fight lasted until the morning of.the ensuing day .
Our losses were heavy ( though the enemy lost even more heavily ) .
We had to retreat into Kiangsi .
When our army was moving into southern Hunan from Mien @-@ tu , the original Array Committee was abolished , and the Front Committee appointed by the Hunan Provincial Committee was organized , with Ch &apos;en I as its secretary .
After the defeat at and retreat from Kuei @-@ tung , the Front Committee was abolished , and the Action Committee was organized to command it , with Mao &apos; Tse @-@ tung as its secretary .
On 8 September we arrived at the Ching @-@ kang Mountains via ChTung @-@ i , Shang @-@ yu and Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan .
The causes for the failure of our assault on Ch &apos;en @-@ chou were six @-@ fold : ( 1 ) Some officers and men were homesick , thuc losing their fighting morale , and some of them were unwilling to go to southern Hunan , thus running counter to mass psychology ; ( 2 ) it was a hot summer and the soldiers were exhausted ; ( 3 ) after marching several hundred li from Ling @-@ hsien , we lost contact with the border area and became isolated ; ( A ) the worker and peasant masses of Hunan have not been mobilized and so it became a simple military venture ; ( 5 ) we were ignorant about the enemy situation ; ( 6 ) preparations were inadequate , and our officers and soldiers did not understand the significance of the war .
After the rout , one infantry company and one artillery battery under battalion commander Yuan Ch &apos;ung @-@ ch &apos;uan &#91; 5913 1504 0350 &#93; rebelled .
Although these two units were eventually recovered , the regimental commander , Wang Erh @-@ cho &#91; 3769 3643 3820 &#93; , was killed , which was of course a serious loss .
.On 30 August four regiments of Wu Shang &apos;s Hunan troops and Wang Chun &apos;s Kiangsi troops mounted a fierce attack on the Ching @-@ kang Mountains , taking advantage of the fact that our forces had not yet arrived after their defeat at Kuei @-@ tung .
We had less than a battalion , but relying on the natural barriers of Huang @-@ yang @-@ chieh ( the path of the Ching @-@ kang Mountains from Ning @-@ kang ) , we fought bitterly for a.whole night , repulsing the enemy and killing many of them .
This campaign has enabled us to preserve our last bastion , and to frighten the enemy badly .
This was one of the famous battles in the border area .
When the Front Committee was in Hunan , it organized two county committees in Kuei @-@ tung and Ju @-@ ch &apos;eng which , together with the original county committees in Tzu @-@ hsing and Ch &apos;en @-@ chou , were placed under the direction of a Special Committee , with Tu Hsiu @-@ ching as its secretary and located Yu @-@ chri Shih @-@ erh @-@ tung in Tzu @-@ hsing .
A Red Guard corps was formed for Tzu @-@ hsing , Kuei @-@ tung and Ju @-@ ch &apos;eng which received 80 rifles .
Ch &apos;en @-@ chou had a Red Guard corps located at Yao @-@ ling , possessing some 40 or 50 rifles .
The conditions in Lai @-@ yang and Yung @-@ hsing were unclear .
The 30th and 33d regiments of the Peasant Army which returned to southern Hunan in May had long been dispersed , and most of their arms , some 300 to 400 rifles , had been surrendered to the enemy .
The broad masses that had been mobilized
by the Red Army during the spring also were totally suppressed by the enemy .
When the Red Army was passing through Tzu @-@ hsing . , Ju @-@ ch &apos;eng and Kuei @-@ tung , some of the local masses were mobilized to set up Soviets .
The sand fields in Kuei @-@ tung were distributed , though their present status is unknown .
Because of the barriers of communication , no letters have arrived from the newly organized Southern Hunan Special Committee ,
( 3 ) Status of Border Independent Regime From September to Present
Since April of this year , the independent regime &apos;s areas have been extended steadily .
Following the battle at Lung @-@ yuan @-@ k &apos;ou ( on the border between Yung @-@ hsin and Ning @-@ kang ) on 23 June and the routing of the enemy in Kiangsi for the fourth time , the border areas have reached their zenith &#91; of development &#93; comprising all three counties of Ning @-@ kang , Yung @-@ hsin and Lien @-@ hua , small portions of Chi @-@ an and An @-@ fu , the northern part of Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan , and the southeastern part of Ling @-@ hsien .
Most of the land has already been distributed , and the remainder is being distributed .
District and township Soviets have been set up universally .
There are county Soviets in Ning @-@ kang , Yung @-@ hsin , Lien @-@ hua and Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan , and a Border Area soviet has also been established .
In the villages , worker and peasant insurrection corps armed with spears have been organized .
At the district and county levels , Red Guards have been organized , armed with rifles .
In July , the enemy from Kiangsi attacked , and in August enemies from Kiangsi and Hunan joined forces to attack Huang @-@ yang @-@ chieh , with the result that all the county cities and plains have been occupied by the enemy .
The Peace Preservation Corps ( armed with rifles ) and the levies ( armed with spears ) acted as their vanguards .
They ran amok , spreading the White terror into both towns and the countryside .
Most of the party and government organs have disintegrated while the rich peasants and opportunists in the party have become undependable , As a result of the battle at Huang @-@ yang @-@ chieh on 30 August , the enemy realized that it was impossible to destroy the natural barriers of the Ching @-@ kang Mountains .
The enemy from Hunan began to retreat to Ling @-@ hsien , while the enemy from Kiangsi began to entrench itself in the county towns , and in the towns and villages on the plains .
Nevertheless , they could not do anything to us in our strongholds such as the western and northern districts of Ning @-@ kang , the Pei @-@ hsiang T &apos;ien @-@ lung district of Yung @-@ hsin , as well its Hsiao @-@ hsi @-@ chiang and Nan @-@ nien @-@ shan districts , the Shang @-@ hsi district of Lien @-@ hua , the Ching @-@ kang Mountains district of Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan , and the Ch &apos;ing @-@ shih @-@ kang Ta @-@ yuan of Ling @-@ hsien .
During July and August , scores of battles were fought by one regiment of the Red Army and by the Red Guards corps in various counties .
Although we were defeated , we lost no more than 30 rifles .
Finally , we withdrew deep into the mountains .
The enemy deployed its entire force to attack .
They combined the armed forces of Kiangsi and Hunan to attack our bastion in the Ching @-@ kang Mountains , but they withdrew dismally .
On 30 August we won a victory over the suppression armies at Huang @-@ yang @-@ chieh ; on 8 September our southern expeditionary force returned to the Ching @-@ kang Mountains , thus opening up a new situation after September .
As our army was marching to the Ching @-@ kang Mountains through Ch &apos;ung &apos; -i , Shang @-@ yu and Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan , the Independent 7th Division of western Kiangsi under Liu Shih @-@ i &#91; 6491 1102 3015 &#93; , taking advantage of our defeat , sent five battalions to pursue us to Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan .
On 13 September we deployed four battalions to attack Liu &apos;s units , routed them at the city of Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan , captured 250 rifles , a battalion commander and a company leader , 34 platoon leaders and some 200 soldiers .
The remnants withdrew to Kan ^ -chou .
The Action Committee which directed the army ( with Mao Tse @-@ tung as secretary ) and the Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan county committee collaborated in guiding the masses of Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan and in canvassing supplies for the army .
Guerrilla action was conducted in the countryside , divided into four routes , each directed by an action committee .
When the eastern route committee reached Wan @-@ an , it made contact with the Wan @-@ an County Committee .
On 24 September Li Wen @-@ pin &apos;s &#91; 2621 2429 2619 &#93; Kiangsi regiment came from T &apos;ai @-@ ho , while the Independent 7th Division came from Kan @-@ chou to attack the city of Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan .
As our force was not concentrated , we could only deploy two battalions for the battle .
We were defeated , but morale remained intact .
Our main force returned to the Ching @-@ kang Mountains on 26 September .
On 1 October we engaged the 27th regiment of Chou Hun @-@ yuan &apos;s &#91; 0719 3268 0037 &#93; brigade under Hsiung Shih @-@ hui &#91; 3574 1709 6540 &#93; in a battle at Ning @-@ kang , capturing one battalion commander , one company leader , two platoon leaders , 100 soldiers and 110 rifles .
Remnants of the enemy units retreated to Yung @-@ hsin and the entire county of Wing @-@ kang was recovered .
While we
were attacking Ning @-@ kang , the regiment under Li Wen @-@ pin &apos;s command reinforced the enemy forces via T &apos;ai @-@ ho and Yung @-@ hsin from Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan , leaving only the Independent 7th Division ( which was the weakest ) in Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan .
There was thus considerable hope for us to mobilize the masses in Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan , and moreover , we were faced with the urgent problem of seeding the army .
We , therefore , reoccupied Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan on 13 October , as the Independent 7th Division took flight without a fight .
The Action Committee of Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan ( with Chu Teh as secretary ) collaborated with the County Committee there to carry out guerrilla tactics in five routes , distributing land , setting up Soviets , developing party organization , and collecting funds .
At that time , the 3d Division of the Eighth Army under Yen Chung @-@ hsing &#91; 7051 0112 5887 &#93; , with 126 rifles , had defected to our army and been reorganized as a special service battalion commanded by Pi Chan @-@ yuan .
On 2 November Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan was again attacked by two regiments of the 21st Brigade of Kiangsi troops commanded by Li Wen @-@ pin as well as the Independent 7th Division .
With a view to avoiding any hard battle , we evacuated Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan , trying to make a blitz attack on Ning @-@ kang and Yung @-@ hsin where the enemy forces were weaker , in order to break one side of the siege .
On 9 November we routed the 27th Regiment of Chou &apos;s brigade at the city of Ning @-@ kang and Lung @-@ yuan @-@ krou , capturing 160 rifles , killing one battalion commander and scores of soldiers .
We captured two deputy -battalion commanders , a company commander and a platoon leader , and more than 100 soldiers .
Next day , we advanced to Yung @-@ hsin to attack the 28th Regiment and the remnants of the 27th Regiment of Chou &apos;s brigade until 3 o &apos;clock in the afternoon .
We defeated the enemy and our vanguards occupied the city of Yung @-@ hsin .
However , unexpectedly , the enemy 35th Brigade arrived from Hung @-@ t &apos;ien @-@ ho as reinforcement .
We had to withdraw
to Ning @-@ kang in -the face of this adverse situation- Although there were heavy casualties to the enemy , we also suffered scores of dead and wounded .
This was the biggest battle since our return to the border area .
Red Guards and insurrection corps fought in both battles , though they did not do too much .
The status now in the border area is : Chou Hun @-@ yuan &apos;s 14th brigade and Liu Shih @-@ i &apos;s 15th brigade are now stationed in the Kiangsi border , both of which have been defeated and are being reorganized ; the 21st brigade under Li Wen @-@ pin and the 35th brigade are crack troops ; the 8th Army under Wu Shang is entrenched in the three counties of Cha @-@ ling , Ling @-@ hsien and Kuei @-@ tung on the Hunan border .
The area of Red power extends from Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan and the southern foot of Ching @-@ kang Mountains in the south to the borders of Lien @-@ hua in the north , including the entire county of Ning @-@ kang , parts of Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan , Ling @-@ hsien and Yung @-@ hsin , and forming a narrow strip from north to south .
The Shang @-@ hsi District in Lien @-@ hua , TTien @-@ lung District in Yung @-@ hsin , and the Wan @-@ nien shan area are not contiguous , though they have also been occupied by Red power .
The enemy is attempting to surround this unbroken bastion by both military attack and economic blockade in order to wipe out this &quot; Communist bandit lair . &quot; A hard struggle is bound to be waged with the passage of time , and they will never give us any respite .
( 4 ) Current Problems A.
Military Question
( 1 ) The Military Stage : Since the struggle in the border area has become exclusively military , both the party and the masses must be militarized .
How to deal with the enemy and how to fight have thus become important items on the daily agenda of the army and local party organs at all levels .
The so @-@ called independent regime must be armed ; that is , where there is no armed force , or an inadequately armed one , or though armed , the tactics are wrong , then it will be , instead , captured by the White armed forces immediately ( White army , peace preservation corps and levies ) .
This kind of struggle is bound to become more violent every day , and so the problems will also become more complex and aggravated .
( 2 ) The Sources of the Red Army : They may be divided into the following six categories : ( a ) units formerly under Yeh TTing and Ho Lung at Swatow ; ( b ) the Guards Regiment at Wuchang ; ( c ) peasant armies of Liu @-@ yang and P &apos;ing @-@ chiang ; ( d ) peasant armies of southern Hunan and the workers of Shui @-@ k &apos;ou @-@ shan ; ( e ) soldiers captured from the units under Hsu KTo @-@ hsiang &#91; 6070 0344 4382 &#93; , T &apos;ang Sheng @-@ chih , Pal Chung @-@ hsi , Chu P &apos;ei @-@ teh , Wu Shang and Hsiung Shih @-@ hui ; and ( f ) worker and peasant elements from the various border counties .
The first four types are the main force .
However , after more than a year of fighting , the old units of Yeh and Ho the Guards Regiment , and the peasant troops of Liu @-@ yang and P &apos;ing @-@ chian have lost two @-@ thirds of their strength , leaving only one @-@ third intact .
Even the Red Army of southern Hunan has also suffered terrific losses after 8 months of fighting .
Thus , the first four categories , because of their excellent quality , have remained the basic strength of the 4th Red Array , but are outnumbered by the last two categories .
Of the last two categories ,
captured soldiers form the majority .
Without this replenishment ?
it would have been impossible to fill up the 4th Army .
Moreover , its quality has also suffered considerably .
The increase in men has not kept up with the increase in rifles .
Rifles are not easily lost , but soldiers are wounded , killed , fall sick or desert ( during a defeat ) .
Among peasants in the border area , very few were willing to enlist .
With the distribution of land , most of them have gone out to plant the fields .
At present , the number of worker and peasant elements is extremely small in the 4th Army in the border area .
Thus , the problem is still rather serious .
The Hunan Provincial Committee has promised to send us workers from An @-@ yuan and we hope this will be done soon .
( 3 ) Composition : One portion consists of worker and peasant elements while the other is formed largely of the vagabond proletariat ( the Hunan Provincial Committee has alleged that they are all vagabond proletariat , but this is not true ) .
This vagabond proletariat portion must be replaced by worker and peasant elements . , though it is difficult to find them .
The vagabond proletariat elements seem to be excellent in combat and , as the war goes on every day casualties have been heavy .
Thus , the vagabond proletariat are indispensable , but it is not easy to find replacements from among them .
Under these circumstances , we must intensify political training in order to improve their quality .
( 4 ) Character : The majority has been converted from mercenary forces but the mercenary system is abolished as soon as they join the Red Army , There has never been any pay , but there there is rice money and petty cash for miscellaneous expenses .
In regard to land distribution among the Red Army officers and men , with the exception of those soldiers in various counties in the border areas whose families.are given land as a rule , it is rather difficult for officers and men from remote places to obtain land .
This is because , first , there is very little land in the occupied area which is mountainous .
Moreover , peasants have complained that the land distributed to them is insufficient , and so there is no surplus land .
Secondly , because of the constant changes in the fortunes of war , the occupied area is very unstable .
The land distributed by Red power yesterday could be easily taken away by White power today , in which case one must pay rent to the landlord .
Thus , it is not only the officers and men in the Red Army who are wary toward the concept of land distribution ; even among the peasants , many are aware of the uncertainties of the situation .
This is due to the fact that the White power is too strong , and the struggle between White and Red has been too recurrent and too severe .
Nonetheless , that the Red Army officers and men should receive laud is an irrevocable principle , though the methods of implementation remain to be discussed .
( 5 ) Political Training : The Red Army soldiers have learned class consciousness and such essentials as distribution of land , the establishment of Soviets , the arming of workers and peasants , etc .
They realize that they are fighting for themselves and the workers and peasants .
Because of this , they have not complained even though they have had to endure hardships in the midst of this bitter struggle .
There is a soldiers &apos; committee at the company , battalion and regimental levels whose duties are to supervise the officers , represent
the interests of soldiers , participate in army administration , undertake political training internally ( in the army ) and launch mass movements externally .
With a sound soldiers * committee , it may not be necessary to have a political department .
The working personnel can be incorporated into the soldiersT committee , which is better than maintaining a political department separately .
Before April this year , there was a political department in all army units here , but it has been abolished because the results have not been too satisfactory .
With the political department , there was a feeling on the part of the officers , soldiers and masses that political work could be done by a few people of that department , and so they deemed that the duty of the remaining people was limited to fighting .
But after its abolition , everybody realized that they not only have to fight , but also must undertake political work ( political training and1mass movement ) .
This has resulted in breaking the simple military @-@ minded tradition .
Based on past experience , it has been held that the party representative system should not be abolished .
Party representatives at the army and divisional levels , however , could be abolished ( there being no divisional level here , while the regiment is directly under the army ) .
Party representatives cannot be abolished at the regiment , battalion and company level , particularly at the company level at this time .
This is because the party branch is built upon the company .
The party representative of a company has the duty of supervising the soldiers &apos; committee to carry out political training and to direct mass movements , and he is also the branch secretary in the party .
As it has been borne out by facts , where the company &apos;s party representative is better , that company will also be better .
Among the lower echelon cadres , it often happens that because of the heavy casualties , some of the enemy soldiers captured only yesterday would be promoted to serve as platoon or even company leaders today .
Among those enemy soldiers that were captured in February and March this year , some have become battalion commanders .
It seems rather absurd to think that just because ours is now called the Red Army , there is no need to have party representatives .
When Chu Teh &apos;s units were in southern Hunan , the system of party representatives was abolished .
Later , he felt that it was not too good , and so when he came to the border area , the system was restored .
If the name is changed to &quot; director , &quot; this would be confused with the directors of the Kuoiaintang , whom most of the captured soldiers detest .
Moreover , any change of name will not change the nature of the system .
Hence , it has been decided that there should be no change .
There have been too many casualties among party representatives .
It is hoped that apart from conducting training classes , the Central Committee and the two provincial committees will send us at least 30 persons who could serve as party representatives .
( 6 ) Military Training : It usually takes other people from 6 months to 1 year to train their soldiers before they can fight : our soldiers might have entered the army yesterday , and required to fight today with no time for training at all .
Consequently , among some middle and lower echelon cadres and many soldiers , the military technique is rather poor .
Their only advantage in combat is courage , and this Is very dangerous .
Since it is impossible to have long periods of rest and training , the only thing is to try to avoid fighting in order to gain , the necessary time for training .
have established a training corps of 150 members and we intend to continue this practice .
We hope that the Central Committee and the two provincial committees will send us at least 30 more officers at the company and platoon level , to the border areas as soon as possible ,
( 7 ) The Problem of Supplies : The Hunan Provincial Committee has asked us to pay attention to the -material life of the soldiers to make it at least a little better than the average worker and peasant .
At present , however , army life is just contrary to that , and we feel that no one else lives so badly as the Red Army soldiers .
Because of the shortage of silver dollars , we have found it difficult to continue to give each person 5 fen for their food ( rice is supplied locally ) each day .
The soldiers1 adage that &quot; down with the capitalists , as we can eat pumpkin every day &quot; is an indication of their distress .
They can endure hardships ; no others can endure hardships better than the 4th Army .
They need only money for foodall other expenses have been curtailed , and even this requires some 10,000 silver dollars a month .
They can get this money only by making the local despots pay .
But first , wherever they have been , there are no more local despots from whom to collect it ; second , as the siege of the enemy is so tight , unless one side of it has collapsed , it would be impossible to venture out too far to strike at the local despots ; and third , the enemy threat being so serious , it is impossible for one or two battalions of soldiers to go out to look for funds , and if you want to get more , you have to have more soldiers .
This is no simple problem .
Now , although we have the cotton for winter clothing for the 5,000 soldiers of the entire army ( regular Red Army ) , we are still short of cloth , and do not know when this can be solved .
It is already so cold now , but many soldiers are still wearing two layers of thin clothing .
Fortunately , they are used to hardships , and they are equally poor regardless of who they are .
From the army commander down to the cook , each person gets 2 fen uniformly for their food .
When the expense money is 20 fen each , they would all get the same amount , and when it is 40 fen , they would all get 40 fen each .
Because they all understand this is &quot; suffering hardships for the proletariat , &quot; they do not complain .
Although this is so , the economic problem remains rather serious .
( 8 ) The Problem of Wounded and Sick Soldiers : After each engagement , there are some wounded soldiers .
Because of the lack of nutrition , the cold , and other causes , there are many sick .
The Red Army &apos;s hospitals are built in the Ching @-@ kang Mountains .
They treat patients with both Chinese and Western medicine , but both drugs and doctors are in short supply and the problem is grave .
In September there were more than 200 wounded and sick soldiers , and this number has increased since the recent battle at Yung @-@ hsin .
There are now more than 800 patients in the hospitals , including some nursing staff .
Morale will be affected if the wounded are not given proper care .
But to do this requires adequate equipment and supplies which are unsatisfactory and difficult to obtain .
The Hunan Provincial Committee has promised to send some medicines , but no delivery has been made so far .
We hope that the Central Committee and the two provincial committees will loan us a few doctors &#91; trained in &#93; Western medicine and some iodine .
( 9 ) Democracy .in the Army ; Although the material life of the Red Army is poor and although there have been incessant engagements , it has managed to maintain its morale .
Apart from the role played by the party , this is due largely to the thorough implementation of democracy .
The officers do not abuse their soldiers ; officers and men receive equal treatment : they eat the same food and dress alike .
The soldiers enjoy freedom of speech and assembly .
All formalities and protocol have been abolished and economic management is open ; the representatives of the soldiers can look into the budget and accounts , They also manage their own mess , and though each person gets about only 5 fen for their mess , they could still put aside 60 or 70 coppers a day for personal expenses .
These measures have proved to be most satisfying to the soldiers .
This is especially true for the newly captured soldiers who realize how different their new army life is from their old army life , so much so that they seem to be two different worlds .
Although they may feel that the material life of the Red Army is not as good as that of the White , their spirit is liberated and they get along well .
Although they are the same soldiers , they did not fight so bravely for the enemy as they do now for the Red Army , and this is due to the influence of democracy .
The Red Army is like a melting pot in which captured soldiers can be melted as soon as they come over .
This is a fact .
In China , there is great need for democracy not only among the worker and peasant masses , but also for the army , and even more urgently .
To practice democracy thoroughly in the army constitutes an important policy to destroy China &apos;s feudalistic mercenary armies .
This is because the life of soldiers in China &apos;s feudal mercenary army is simply intolerable .
( 10 ) Party Organization in the Army : There are now four levels in the party organization of the army : the company branch , battalion committee , regimental committee and army committee .
The party branch is established in each company ; and a small group is established in each squad .
An important reason why the 4th , Army has remained intact after so many battles is due to the fact that &quot; the party branch is organized on the company basis . &quot; Two years ago , our party organization in the Kuomintang army failed to grasp the soldiers , and even in Yeh T * ing &apos;s units , there was only a party branch in each regiment , which was most absurd .
Now , the ratio between party members and nonpartisans in the army is one to three , which means there is a party member in every four persons .
Recently , we decided to develop more party members among the combat soldiers so that the number of party members and nonpartisans will attain a fifty @-@ fifty ratio .
There is now a shortage of good secretaries in the company branches .
Therefore , we are asking the Central Committee to send more active elements who find it difficult to stay in their respective localities to come here to serve as company party representatives .
Among the working staff who came from southern Hunan , almost all of them are doing party work in the army ( and they do political work simultaneously ) .
In August we lost some of them in southern Hunan , and so it is even more difficult now to spare them .
Since the Army committee ( Army party committee ) was elected by the first army representatives conference at Ning @-@ kang in April , six army party representatives conferences have been held in the past 7 months , the last on
14 @-@ 15 November .
This conference was held after receipt of a letter from the Central Committee .
Thus , decisions have been adopted on political , military , organization and propaganda affairs , and it was a better conference than all previous ones .
The conference elected an army committee of 23 members , with Chu Teh as secretary ( designated by the Central Committee ) .
It is the highest party organ in the army and is under the jurisdiction of the Front Committee .
Externally , this is the military council of the border area soviet , commanding the Red Army and local militia forces .
The party organization in the army has been set up with considerable success , and some party members are very determined in their revolutionary outlook , though the majority of them to not have a good education .
We must pay more attention to this later .
( 11 ) Local Armed Forces : The local forces consist of the Red Guards and the worker and peasant insurrection corps .
The insurrection corps is armed with spears and shotguns .
It is based on the village as the unit , each village having one detachment , whose strength is based on the size of the village .
Its duty is to suppress counterrevolutionaries and to protect the village regime .
When the enemy comes , the insurrection corps will help the Red Army or the Red Guards in combat duties .
A secret organization used to launch uprisings , the insurrection corps was founded in Yung @-@ hsin .
Later , it seized the political power of the entire county , thus becoming , an open organization .
This system has since been extended in the border areas , and retains its original name .
The arms of the Red Guards corps consist of five- , nine @-@ and single @-@ shot rifles , with five @-@ shot ones in the majority .
The numbers of rifles in the various counties are as follows : 140 in Ning @-@ kang , 220 in Yung @-@ hsin , 43 in Lien @-@ hua , 50 in Ch &apos;a @-@ ling , 90 in Ling @-@ hsien , 130 in Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan and 10 in Wan @-@ an , for a total of 683 .
Most of these have been supplied by the Red Army , while a small portion has been captured from the enemy .
Most of the Red Guards units have been fighting constantly with the peace preservation corps and the levies of the big gentry in the &quot; various counties and as a result their ability to handle weapons and their fighting capability have increased steadily .
Before the Ma @-@ jih ( 21 May ) incident , the number of rifles held by the peasant self @-@ defense corps in the various border counties was as follows : 300 in Yu @-@ hsien , 300 in Ch &apos;a @-@ ling , 60 in Ling @-@ hsien , 50 in Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan , 80 in Yung @-@ hsin , 60 in Lien @-@ hua , 60 in Ning @-@ kang ( Yuan Wen @-@ ts &apos;ai &apos;s units ) and 60 in the Ching @-@ kang Mountains ( Wang Tso &apos;s units ) , totaling 970 .
After that incident , with the exception of the Yuan and Wang units , which remained intact , only 6 rifles were left in Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan , 1 in Lien @-@ hua ; all the remaining rifles having been seized by the big landlords .
As a result of the opportunist line , they were unable to hold on to their rifles .
Now , the Red Guards units in the various counties are still short of rifles , and the big landlords possess far more rifles than the Red Guards .
This is why the Red Army must continue to supply rifles to the various counties , and where it will not impair the Red Army , everything must be done to help arm the local militia forces so that they can be strengthened steadily .
The Red Army conference has stipulated that the four @-@ company system be adopted , with 75 rifles in each company ( when this number is added to the rifles of the special services company , machine @-@ gun company , mortar company and the battalion and regimental headquarters , each regiment should have 1,075 rifles ) .
Moreover , weapons
143
captured from the enemy should have been distributed as much as possible to the local militia forces of workers and peasants .
The officers of the Red Guards corps should be trained at the training corps maintained by the Red Army .
Hereafter , the number of officers commanding Red Guards who have been sent by the Red Army must be curbed gradually .
In the meantime , Chu P &apos;ie @-@ teh has also been massively arming the peace preservation corps and the levies , and the number and combat strength of the armed forces equipped by the big gentry in the border counties are also formidable .
Thus , expansion of the Red local militia forces in the border area cannot be delayed any further .
( 12 ) The Strategy of Red Army and Red Guards : In addition to recognizing guiding principles ( that where the enemy is small in number , it should be eliminated immediately by superior force , and where the enemy is numerous and strong , mass war strategy should be adopted instead of fighting a hard battle ) , the Red Army should concentrate its strength while the Red Guards should disperse its strength .
Now , the bourgeois regime is comparatively stable , the enemy is in a position to deploy an enormous number of troops against the Red Army .
Thus , it would be most inimical for the Red Army to disperse its strength .
In our experience , we have almost always suffered defeat when our strength was spread thin .
But we have invariably won when we have concentrated our forces to attack enemy forces that were smaller than ours , equal to ours , or slightly larger than ours .
The area of guerrilla warfare as prescribed by the directives of the Central Committee covers thousands of li in length and breadth .
This is too extensive and was due probably to the over @-@ estimation of our military strength .
( Since the number of rifles in the 4th Ked Army is known to the Hunan Provincial Committee , we have asked Comrade Yuan Teh @-@ sheng to make a report orally , and so it Is not listed here . ) In regard to the strategy of the Red Guards corps , it would be better to disperse their strength .
This method is being adopted by Red Guards in the various counties .
( 13 ) Military Organization : We are still following the old Kuomintang method of organization .
We are unable to decode the Central Committee &apos;s &quot; Resolution on Military Work . &quot; Also we cannot surmise what was the military system of the T &apos;ai @-@ pTing regime .
Please send these documents again so that we may discuss them .
( 14 ) Propaganda Aimed at the Enemy : The most effective propaganda is to release captured soldiers and to give medical treatment to wounded enemy soldiers .
When enemy soldiers and enemy battalion company and platoon commanders are captured , they are , after some propaganda work on our part , divided into those who want to stay and those who wish to go .
We should allow those who want to leave to get their wish and give them the necessary traveling expenses .
This kind of propaganda will shatter the enemy allegation that &quot; Communist bandits kill anyone in sight . &quot; As a result of this policy , the &quot; Ten @-@ day Bulletin of the 9th Division &quot; issued by Yang Chi &apos;ih @-@ sheng said that our method is &quot; sinister . &quot; The officers and men of the Red Army are most enthusiastic in welcoming and comforting captured enemy soldiers .
At each &quot; rally to bid farewell to new brothers , &quot; the captured soldiers responded with warm gratitude in their speeches .
Medical
treatment for the wounded enemy soldiers also has a great effect .
Some clever enemy ( such as Li Wen @-@ pin ) have imitated our method by not killing our captured soldiers and by treating our wounded soldiers .
However , after our men have been captured by the enemy , they often bring their rifles back with them at the next engagement .
Such incidents have occurred twice .
Very few Red Army soldiers have been captured by the enemy in the border area .
This is because the Red Army has rarely lost any battle there .
Additionally , we have also done much in written propaganda , such as slogan @-@ writing .
Whenever we reach a new place , we cover the walls with our slogans .
We are , however , short of persons who have drawing skills and so we hope the Central Committee and the two provincial committees will send us some .
( 15 ) Military Strongholds : The first stronghold is the Ching @-@ kang Mountains located at the juncture of the four counties of Ning @-@ kang , Lin @-@ hsien , Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan and Yung @-@ hsin .
Its northern foot is Mao @-@ p &apos;ing , in Ning @-@ kang , and its southern foot is Huang @-@ pa in Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan , a distance of 90 li between them .
Its eastern foot is Na @-@ shan in Yung @-@ hsin and its western foot is Shui @-@ k &apos;ou in Ling @-@ hsien , 180 li apart .
It has an area of 550 square li , extending from Na @-@ shan and Lung @-@ yuan @-@ k &apos;ou ( in Yung @-@ hsin ) to Hsin @-@ ch &apos;eng , Mao @-@ p &apos;ing and Ta @-@ lung ( in Ning @-@ kang ) , to Shih @-@ tu , Shui @-@ k &apos;ou and Hsia @-@ ts &apos;en ( in Ling @-@ hsien ) , and then to Ying @-@ pan @-@ yu , Tai @-@ chia @-@ pu , Ta @-@ feng , Tui @-@ tzu @-@ ch &apos;ien , Huang @-@ ao , Wu @-@ tu @-@ chiang , and Ch &apos;e @-@ ao ( in Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan ) .
In the mountains are located such places as Ta @-@ ching , Hsiao @-@ ching , Shang @-@ ching , Chung @-@ ching , Hsia @-@ ching , Tzu @-@ p &apos;ing , Hsia @-@ chuang , Hsing @-@ chou , Ta &apos;ao @-@ p &apos;ing , Pai @-@ ni @-@ hu and Lo @-@ fu where paddy fields and villages are scattered .
These places have been historically the lairs for bandits and stragglers .
The population is less than 2,000 , and the grain crop is under 10,000 piculs and so all the grain for the army must be supplied from Ning @-@ kang , Yung @-@ hsin .
and Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan counties .
All strategic passes in the mountains are defended by heavy fortifications .
Located in the mountains are the Red Army hospitals , clothing shops , arsenal and the rear offices of the various regiments .
Foodstuffs are now being hauled to the mountain bastions from Ning @-@ kang , and if we can get sufficient supplies ( grain and cash , the most important being cash ) , it will be impregnable .
There is a defense committee in charge of local defense , with Wang Tso as its director .
The second stronghold is Chiu @-@ lung , located at the juncture of the four counties of Ning @-@ kang , Yung @-@ hsin , Lien @-@ hua and Ch &apos;a @-@ ling .
This base is not as important as the Ching @-@ kang Mountains , but is fortified and serves as the rearmost base for the local militia forces of the four counties .
Surrounded by White regimes on all sides , a military bastion with strong natural barriers is indispensable for the existence of the Red regime .
Because of the fact that it is surrounded by the enemy , it is necessary to defend every side , and so natural barriers are important in reinforcing the inadequacy of human resources .
However , when the bourgeois political power is stable , protracted Red occupation will be difficult .
( B ) Agrarian Problem
( 1 ) Agrarian Status in Border Area : Generally speaking , over 60 percent of the land is controlled by landlords , and less than 40 percent is in the hands of peasants .
Individually speaking , land ownership is most concenr @-@ trated in Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan in the Kiangsi border , where 80 percent is owned by
landlords , Yung @-@ hsln comes next , with 70 percent owned by landlords .
In Wan @-@ an , Ning @-@ kang and Lien @-@ hua there are more rich peasants .
With the exception of Wan @-@ an where no direct investigation has been made , although we say that there are many rich peasants in Ning @-@ kang and Lien @-@ hua , landlords still own more land therethe ratio being 60 : 40 .
In Ch &apos;a @-@ ling and Ling @-@ hsien on the Hunan border , conditions are similar , as some 70 percent of land is owned by landlords .
( 2 ) The Problem of the Intermediate Class : Under these circumstances , it would seem that confiscation of all lands and redistribution of them would be supported by the majority .
However , there are roughly three classes in rural areas , namely , the big gentry consisting of big and medium @-@ sized landlords , the intermediate class of small landlords and rich peasants , and the poor peasants .
In the intermediate class , the rich peasants often align themselves with the interests of the small landlords .
Although the land owned by the rich peasants is a small percentage of the total , if combined with the land .owned by the small landlords , the amount is sizeable .
This situation seems to be prevalent throughout the country .
The policy in the border areas has been to confiscate all the land and then to distribute it thoroughly .
Thus , both the big gentry and the intermediate class have been attacked in the areas of Red power .
Although this is the policy , it has been hampered by the intermediate class during its implementation .
In the early days of the revolution , the intermediate class capitulated to the poor peasants superficially , but in reality conspired to use their former social status and their clannishness to spread rumors intimidating the poor peasants , thus delaying the distribution of land .
When they were pressured to such an extent that no further delay was possible , they either concealed the actual extent of their land , or kept the rich land for themselves and reported the poor land to the authorities .
During that period , because of the protracted persecution and the uncertainty of revolutionary victory , the poor peasants were deceived by the intermediate class and did not dare to take positive action .
It is only when the revolution has become resurgent and seized political power in one or several counties , when the reactionary army has been defeated repeatedly , and when the prowess of the Red Array has been demonstrated effectively that positive action has been taken in rural villages against the intermediate class .
For instance , the southern section of Yung @-@ hsin has the largest intermediate class .
It has also been most stubborn in delaying redistribution of land and in concealing landholdings .
But it was only after the Red Army won a huge victory at Lung @-@ yuan @-@ krou on 23 June , and the district executed several people who tried to postpone land redistribution , that land was actually redistributed .
Nonetheless , in almost any county , the feudal system of family organization is prevalent ; usually one single family dominates one village or even several villages .
The result is that it could take a long time before class splitting in the village is realized and the clan sentiment overcome .
In rural villages dominated by family organizations , it is not the big gentry but the intermediate class that creates the biggest problem ,
( 3 ) Defection of the Intermediate Class Under the White Terror ; As the intermediate class had been under attack during the revolutionary upsurge ,
It immediately defected as soon as the White terror came .
The small landlords and rich peasants of Ning ^ -kang and Yung @-@ hsin led the reactionary troops in burning down the houses of the revolutionary peasants there .
Pursuant to the directions of the reactionaries , they proved to be most courageous in burning houses and arresting people .
When the Red Army again reached Ning @-@ kang ( in September ) , several thousand peasants of Hsin @-@ ch &apos;eng , Ku @-@ ch &apos;eng and Lung ~ shih , persuaded by the propaganda of the reactionaries that &quot; the Communists would kill them , &quot; followed the reactionaries to Yung @-@ hsin .
It was only after we proselytized to them that &quot; peasants who had defected would be killed &quot; and that we &quot; welcome peasants who had defected back to reap grain &quot; that many peasants slowly returned ,
( 4 ) When the revolution is at a low ebb in the nation , the most difficult problem in the occupied areas is that the intermediate class cannot firmly be held .
The main reason for the betrayal by this class is that it has been dealt heavy blows by the revolution .
However , if the poor peasants are undaunted during the revolutionary upsurge , the intermediate class might be scared and not dare to run amok .
When the war &quot; between Li Tsung @-@ jen and T &apos;ang Sheng @-@ chih spread to Hunan , the small landlords in Ch &apos;a @-@ ling tried to make peace with the peasants , some of them even sent pork to peasants as a New Years gift ( At that time , the Red Army evacuated Ch &apos;a @-@ ling to go to Sul @-@ ch &apos;uan ) , After the conclusion of the Li @-@ T &apos;ang &#91; action &#93; , such incidents have also disappeared .
Now that the counterrevolution has reached its high tide in the whole country , the intermediate class that has been under attack has become completely subservient to the big gentry in the White areas , and the poor peasants have become an isolated force .
This is a rather serious problem .
( 5 ) The pressure of daily life as an influence on the intermediate class to defect : Red occupation and White resistance have created two enemy states .
Because of the enemy &apos;s stringent blockade and because of our mishandling of the petty bourgeoisie , trade has been completely stopped between the two areas .
The shortage and the high prices of salt , cloth and medicine as well as other daily necessities , and the difficulty of exporting such items as timber , tea and oil have affected the people in general .
It has also curbed their income .
Although the poor peasants can endure hardship the intermediate class cannot and will go over to the gentry when conditions become intolerable .
This economic problem is most serious .
Thus , unless the splits and wars between the big gentry and the warlords of China continues , and unless the national situation moves forward , the small independent Red regimes will be gravely threatened economically , and the protracted existence of the regimes will become a problem .
This is because such economic pressure is not only intolerable to the middle class , but also unendurable to the worker and peasant classes as well as to the Red Army , &apos; Both Yung @-@ hsin and Ning @-@ kang have no salt to eat , and the supply of cloth and medicine , not to mention other things , has been completely disrupted .
Salt is now sold , but at an exorbitant price , and there are still no cloth and medicine .
In Ning @-@ kang and the western part of Yung @-@ hsin as well as the northern part of Sui @-@ chTuan ( which are still occupied areas at present ) , it
is still impossible to export timber , tea and oil which form their staple products .
There is an acute shortage of money , and if captured local despots refuse to deliver money , there is no money to spend .
That is why the problem is very grave .
( 6 ) The Standard for Land Redistribution : The township serves as the unit for redistribution .
Where it is mountainous and there is very little farmland , such as the Hsiao @-@ chiang District in Yung @-@ hsin , three or four townships form a single unit for redistribution , though such cases are very rare .
In regard to human standards , &apos; then land is redistributed equally among all persons regardless of age and sex .
Now , however , in keeping with the new measures prescribed by the Central Committee , the labor force is used as the standard ; those who can work receive twice as much as land as those who cannot .
( 7 ) The Question of Concessions to the Owner @-@ peasants : This problem has not yet been discussed in depth .
The rich owner @-@ peasants have suggested that the standard of redistribution be based on productivity , that is , those who have more labor and capital ( farm implements , etc . ) should be given more land .
The rich peasants feel that neither equal distribution nor distribution according to the labor force are to their advantage .
They indicate that they are willing to work harder which , , coupled with their capital , would enable them to raise more crops .
If they are given land on an equal basis , it would be tantamount to ignoring ( and negating ) their special efforts as well as their surplus capital , and so they are unwilling .
The measures prescribed by the Central Committee have been carried out here accordingly , but the problem must be discussed further , and a report will be made as soon as conclusions are drawn .
On the other hand , we request the Central Committee and the two provincial committees to inform us as soon as possible the measures adopted by Soviet Russia to treat its kulaks ( rich peasants ) , and especially what measures had been adopted by the Soviet Government within the White regime during the time of its democratic revolution .
As to the question of not confiscating the land of rich @-@ peasants , where the land has been completely confiscated in the occupied border areas , it of course will not arise again .
However , as the area is expanded , the policy of nonconfiscation will be applied during initial stages in order to enable the rich @-@ peasants to strike against the big gentry and to help the poor peasants .
( 8 ) Land Tax : In Ning @-@ kang , the tax is 20 percent , which is about 5 percent higher than that prescribed by the Central Committee .
Since collection is now under way , it cannot be changed , but could be reduced next year .
In Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan , Ling @-@ hsien and Yung @-@ hsin , the terrain is mountainous and the peasants are so poor that it is inadvisable to collect tax from them .
The funds for the government and the Red Guards must be obtained from the local despots in the White areas .
The rice for the sustenance of the Red Army can be obtained for the time being from the land tax in Ning @-@ kang , while cash has also been obtained from squeezing the local despots .
As a result of guerrilla operations in Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan in October , some 10,000 yuan have been collected which may last for some time , and we will try to look to some other means after this money is gone .
( C ) The Question of Soviets
( 1 ) Soviets of County , District and Township Levels : Soviets on all levels have been organized in the border area , but more In name than in reality .
Among the worker and peasant masses , and even among party members , the meaning of &quot; soviet &quot; is not widely understood .
In many places , they do not have the so @-@ called workers , peasants and soldiers representatives conference , The executive committee of the soviet at the district and township levels , and even at the county level , is usually elected at a mass rally .
It can neither discuss problems , nor give political training , though it can be easily manipulated by intellectuals and opportunists .
This is due to the fact that they do not understand what constitutes a soviet , that the representatives of workers , peasants and soldiers form the highest permanent organ of political power , while the executive committee is merely an administrative organ during the recess of the representatives &apos; conference .
This is the biggest mistake of many localities in the border areas regarding the organ of political power .
In some places there are representatives conferences , though they also merely regard the conference as an ad hoc elected organ vis @-@ a @-@ vis the executive committee .
After the election , the power is controlled by the executive committee , and the conference will not even be mentioned .
This does not mean that there are no bona fide soviet organizations , though the number is extremely small .
This is due to the woeful lack of propaganda and education on this new political system of Soviets .
The evil habits of dictatorship and dogmatism during the feudal era have become steeped in the minds of the masses and even party members .
They still cannot eradicate these habits .
They are prone to follow the easy course , and dislike the complex democratic system .
In order that democratic centralism may be applied to mass organizations , its efficacy must be demonstrated in the revolutionary struggle .
This will enable the masses to understand that this kind of organizational method is most conducive to mobilizing the strength of the masses . , and most beneficial to struggle .
Only after they have gained this understanding will it be universally and truly established .
We are now enacting detailed organic laws for Soviets at all levels ( based on the outlines of the Central Committee ) in order to correct some of the previous mistakes .
The soldiers soviet ( soldiers ?
representatives conference on all levels ) in the Red Army is also being established regularly .
This would also rectify the mistake of having only soldiers &apos; committees but no regular soldiers1 conferences .
( 2 ) The Executive Committee on All Levels : The masses now generally understand the &quot; soviet government of workers , peasants and soldiers &quot; at all levels , to be the &quot; ai government , &quot; so dubbed by the masses of Ning @-@ kang ( &quot; ai &quot; meaning &quot; us &quot; in the local dialect , and so this means &quot; our government &quot; ) , or the &quot; su government &quot; dubbed elsewhere , both referring to the committee .
This is because they have not understood the powers of the representatives conference , thinking the committee is the only authority .
This kind of executive committee does not have the backing of a sound representatives conference and is apt to deviate from the views of the masses when decisions are made .
This is often manifested by its wavering and compromise in the
redistribution of land , its recklessness and corruption in economic affairs , its fear of the White Terror , and its lack of resoluteness in the struggle .
Very few plenary meetings are held , and there are also very few standing committee meetings on the district and township government level .
Matters are decided by the chairman , secretary , treasurer or Red Guards commander ( or insurrectionary leader ) .
As a result , the practice of democratic centralism even among government members has not become uniform ,
( 3 ) The government committee is dominated by the bourgeoisie .
During the early stage , especially in government committees on the township level , small landlords , rich peasants and intellectuals vied with each other in seeking power .
They pretended to be enthusiastic , wearing red ribbons , and wormed their way by deceit into the government committee to play dominant roles , while poor peasant members were relegated to secondary roles .
It was only after they were unmasked during the course of struggles and the peasants rose up that it became possible to get rid of them .
Although this state of affairs has not been universal , it has occurred in many places .
( 4 ) The Relation Between the Party and Organs of Political Power : Although there is no such thing as the party issuing orders to the government organs , this does not mean that the government is independent .
The party still enjoys very great prestige among its members and the masses , while the prestige of the government is much less .
This is because the party , for.the sake of convenience , has often handled matters directly , paying no regard to the government .
This kind of mistake has been recurrent in many places .
In some government organs there are no party or corps organizations ; in other places , they have not been used efficiently .
Hereafter , the party must be the master behind the scene ; the party &apos;s policies and measures , with the exception of propaganda , must be carried out through mass organizations .
We must avoid the Kuomintang &apos;s mistake of interfering with the government directly .
( 5 ) The Supreme Soviet : The shingle of the &quot; Worker @-@ Peasant @-@ Soldier Soviet of the Hunan @-@ Kiangsi Border Area &quot; was hung out in May .
Nonetheless , it has been established hurriedly and is rather imperfect .
It is now decided to reorganize the border soviet government and its committee as the supreme organ of political power in the border areas .
( C ) The Status of the Party in the Border Areas
( 1 ) History of Struggle Against Opportunism : About the time of the Ma @-@ jih ( 21 May ) incident , all party organizations in the counties in the border areas may be said to have been opportunistic .
For this reason , they did not wage a resolute struggle when the counterrevolution set in .
When the Red Army ( the 1st Regiment of the 1st Division of the 1st Army of the Worker and Peasant Revolutionary Army ) arrived in the border counties in October last year , there remained only a few party members in hiding , and the party organizations had been totally destroyed .
The period from November to April this year was one of rebuilding the party and the period since May one of great expansion .
In the past year , the phenomenon of opportunism within the party has been found everywhere .
Some of the party members , lacking the will to fight , laid in ambush ( by hiding themselves deep in the mountains when the enemy came ) ; others were more active , but they
became idealistic .adventurists as a result of their bourgeois mentality , This situation diminished after an extended period of training and struggle within the party .
In the meantime , even in the Red Array , this kind of petty @-@ bourgeois restiveness has also lasted a considerable length of time .
When the enemy came , they would put up a fight , or they would take flight .
This kind of ambivalence was often found in the same person and on the same issue .
This has been gradually rectified only after prolonged inner @-@ party struggle and through lessons learned from actual events ( for instance , from losses incurred in reckless battle and defeats suffered during flight ) ,
( 2 ) Localism : The economy of the border area is not only an agrarian economy , it has remained in the age of the hand pestle ( the wooden hand pestle is used in the mountains , while in the plains there are many stone mills ) .
The social organizational unit is the clan , consisting of people with the same name .
The party organization in the villages consists usually of one clan of the same surname living close together , forming one branch .
So the branch meeting is tantamount to a family meeting .
Under this circumstance , it is of course very difficult to have a &quot; fighting Bolshevik Party . &quot; To say that the Communist Party does not have any national or provincial demarcations is , of course , also incomprehensible to them .
They do not even understand that there are no county , district or township differences .
There is localism to a serious extent among the various counties , and is strong even in the different districts and townships in the same county .
Reasoning is only partially successful in overcoming localism and it takes White oppressionwhich is not localizedto gradually convince the people to abandon their localism for common interests and struggle ( for instance , such as joint suppression by two provincial forces ) .
Localism is declining considerably as a result of a series of objective lessons ,
( 3 ) The Question of Native Inhabitants and Outsiders : There is another unique thing in the border area , namely , the rift between the native residents and the outsiders who have settled down there .
There is a great rift between the native population and the immigrants from Kwangtung and Fukien who arrived several centuries ago .
Historically , there has been a deep enmity between them which has become almost a &quot; national &quot; struggle .
These outsiders comprise a few million people , from the Kwangtung border , to the borders of Hunan and Kiangsi , and even to southern Hupeh .
The outsiders , who live in the mountains , have been traditionally oppressed by the native residents on the plains and have never had any political power .
The outsiders have welcomed the national revolution in the last 2 years , thinking it was the prelude of better fortune for them .
But the revolution became a counterrevolution , and the outsiders have been repressed by the native population as before .
Within the border area , such as Ning @-@ kang , Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan , Ling @-@ hsien and Ch @-@ a @-@ ling , the problem of natives and outsiders is very serious , especially in Ning @-@ kang .
Last year and the year before , the indigenous revolutionaries and the outside settlers of Ning @-@ kang joined forces under the leadership of the Communist Party to overthrow the rule of the native gentry , thereby seizing political control throughout the county .
In June of last year , Chu P &apos;ei @-@ tehTs government launched a counterrevolution ,
and in September the local gentry led Chu &apos;s troops in an attack on Ning @-@ kang which continues to the present , In theory , this kind of rift should not extend to the exploited workers and peasants , much less to the party , but in point of fact , because this has been a historical relic , there is still a big gap between the native inhabitants and the outside settlers .
For instance , following the border defeat in August , the native gentry led troops back to Ning @-@ kang , announcing that the outside settlers would massacre the indigenous residents .
As a result , the native peasants began to change their allegiance by wearing white ribbons and acting as guides to the troops to search the mountains and burn down houses .
When the Red Army routed the White troops in October and November , the native peasants fled with the latter , while the outsider peasants confiscated their cattle and belongings .
When this situation is reflected in the party , it often leads to meaningless controversy .
To deal with this situation , we must tell the masses that &quot; peasants who have defected will not be killed &quot; and that &quot; they will be given land when they @-@ return , &quot; thereby inducing them to desert the local gentry and to return home without fear ( many of them have already returned ) .
In the meantime , the county soviet ordered the settler @-@ peasants to return the confiscated cattle and belongings to their original owners , and posted notices that the native peasants will be protected .
Efforts have also been made within the party to eliminate the causes of friction as well as to intensify education so that there will be greater unity .
( 4 ) Defection of Opportunists : During , the revolutionary upsurge in June , many opportunists wormed their way into the party , with the result that the number of party members in the border area grew to more than 10,000 .
Responsible persons in the party branches and in the district committees consisted largely of new members , so good inner @-@ party education was impossible .
As soon as the White terror arrived , the opportunists defected .
They frequently helped the reactionaries to arrest our comrades .
Thus , most of the party organizations in the White area have collapsed .
( 5 ) Party Purge and Establishment of Secret Organizations : After September , a stringent purge has been enforced in the party , imposing strict limitations on the composition of membership .
In Yung @-@ hsin and Ning @-@ kang , all party organizations were dissolved and a new registration was implemented , Registration in Yung @-@ hsin has already been completed , while registration in Ning @-@ kang will be completed soon .
Though the number of party members has been diminished greatly , combat strength has been bolstered .
Whereas the party organization was open to the public before , thus losing any secrecy , since September , all organizational work has been undertaken secretly .
In the meantime , the party has been able to extend its influence into the White area , so that it can play an effective role there .
However , there is as yet no foundation in the towns .
This is due , first , to the fact that the enemy is stronger in the towns , and second , we have done too much damage to bourgeois interests in the towns , where business is slack and the handicraft industry disrupted .
As a result , we have no foothold in the towns .
We are now rectifying our former errors and are trying to set up our organizations in the towns , though the results are still small .
( 6 ) The Guidance Organs on All Levels : The branch executive has been renamed the branch committee ; above the branch is the district committee ?
and above the district is the county committee .
Because of certain unique conditions , a special district committee is formed between the district committee and county committee , such as the Pei @-@ hsiang special district committee and the southeastern special district committee in Yung @-@ hsin .
There are five border area county committees , namely : Ning @-@ kang , Yung @-@ hsin , Lien @-@ hua , Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan and Ling @-@ hsien .
There used to be a county committee in Ch &apos;a @-@ ling , but because it was difficult for our work to expand there , a number of the organs set up last winter and this spring have been destroyed by the White forces .
During the past half year , party work has been done only in the mountainous regions near Ning @-@ kang and Yung @-@ hsin , and so the county organization has been changed to a special district committee .
To carry out our work in Yu @-@ hsien and An @-@ yuan , it is necessary to pass through Ch1a @-@ ling .
We tried to send some people there , but it was abortive .
In January the Wan @-@ an county committee held a joint meeting with the Front Committee in Sui @-@ chTuan but since then , it has been cut off by White forces for more than 6 months .
We did not resume contact with Wan @-@ an until September , when the Red Army conducted guerrilla operations there .
According to a letter from the Wan @-@ an county committee , there used to be nine district committees in Wan @-@ ana but their 120 rifles have all been lost .
We still have our organization in the Police guards there , and our comrades have some rifles .
One battalion of the guerrilla units of the Red Army has reached the vicinity of Wan @-@ an city , but our men there failed to come out to contact us .
Nonetheless , some 80 revolutionary peasants followed us to the Ching @-@ kang Mountains , and were organized as the Wan @-@ an Red Guards , with 10 rifles .
An @-@ fu has no party organization .
The Chi @-@ an county committee has only contacted us twice , though it is a neighboring county of Yung @-@ hsin .
They have not given us any help at all , which is rather strange .
In the Sha @-@ t &apos;ien district in Kuei @-@ tung , land was redistributed in March and again in August .
There , a party organization was set up under the jurisdiction of the Southern Hunan special committee with its center at Shih @-@ erh @-@ tung in Lung @-@ ch &apos;i .
Above the various county committees is the Hunan @-@ Kiangsi border area special committee .
On 20 May the first border area congress was held at Mao @-@ p &apos;ing in Ning @-@ kang .
It elected 23 members of the first committee , with Mao Tse @-@ tung as secretary .
In July , the Hunan provincial committee sent Yang K &apos;ai @-@ ming over as acting secretary , Yang became ill in September , and was replaced by T &apos;an Chen @-@ lin , When the main force of the Red Army went to southern Hunan in August and the border area came under heavy pressure from the White forces , an emergency conference was held in Yung @-@ hsin .
When the Red Army returned to Ning @-@ kang in October , the second congress was convened at Mao @-@ p &apos;ing .
Beginning on 4 October , the congress met for 3 days .
It adopted resolutions on political problems , the tasks of the party in the border area , and propaganda , organization and agrarian problems .
It elected 19 members of the second special committee ( namely : T &apos;an Chen @-@ lin , Chu Teh , Ch &apos;en I , Lung Ch &apos;ao @-@ ch &apos;ing , Chu Ch &apos;ang @-@ kTai , Liu T &apos;ien @-@ ch &apos;ien , Yen P &apos;an @-@ chu , T &apos;an Szu @-@ ts &apos;ung , TTan Ping , Li Chueh @-@ fei , Sung I @-@ yuehs Yuan Wen @-@ ts &apos;ai , Wang Tso @-@ nung , Ch &apos;en Cheng @-@ jen , Mao Tse @-@ tung , Wan Hsieh @-@ hsien , Wang Tso , Yang K &apos;ai @-@ ming and Ho T &apos;ing @-@ ying ) .
Five of them were elected to the standing committee , with T &apos;an Chen @-@ lin ( a worker ) as secretary , and Chren Cheng @-@ jen ( an intellectual ) as deputy
secretary .
On 14 November , the 6th plenary conference of the Red Array was held , electing an army committee of 23 members , with a standing committee of five members , with Chu Teh as secretary .
The special committee and the army committee are under the jurisdiction of the Front .Committee.
On 6 November the Front Committee was Organized which , pursuant to the directive of the Central Committee , comprised of five members , namely : Mao Tse @-@ tung , .
Chu Teh , the secretary of the local party committee ( T &apos;an Chen @-@ lin ) , a worker comrade ( Sung Chriao @-@ sheng ) and a peasant comrade ( Mao K * o @-@ wen ) t with Mao Tse @-@ tung as secretary .
For the time being , the Front Committee has set up a secretariat , a propaganda section , an organization section , a trade union movement committee and a military affairs committee ( which has been elected by the above @-@ mentioned Red Army conference ) .
The Front Committee is placed in charge of the local party &apos; organizations in the various counties .
Because the Front Committee sometimes must move with the army , it is still necessary to keep the Special Committee .
The problem of proletarian ideological leadership in the party is extremely important .
The party organizations in the various border area counties , which can be said to be a party of peasants , will go astray unless they accept the leadership of the urban proletariat .
Besides rectifying the previous errors and paying close attention to the trade union movement in the various counties and towns , it is also necessary to increase workers * representation in the Soviets , It is extremely important for the workers , poor peasants and soldiers of the party to participate in the local party organizations and in the guidance organs of the party in the army .
We have concentrated on this point for the past year , with the result that the number of workers and peasants has been increased in local party organs at all levels .
Although in the Red Army , participation of soldiers in organs on all levels has been satisfactory such participation must be further increased , and attention must be paid to the quality of the participants so that they will be able to undertake &quot; practical leadership , &quot; gradually eliminating bourgeois ideology completely .
( D ) The Question of Revolutionary Character
( 1 ) We completely subscribe to the Communist International &apos;s resolution , on China : China is still at the stage of bourgeois @-@ democratic revolution .
The thorough completion of democratic revolution in China includes , externally * the overthrow of the imperialist special privileges in order to achieve national liberation and unification , and , internally , the elimination of the influences of &quot; compradores in the cities , the eradication of feudal relations in the countryside , completion of the agrarian revolution , and the toppling of the warlord system which has served as another kind of political organization for the big gentry .
It is only by such a democratic revolution that it will be possible to lay a true foundation of a workers &apos; regime and then advance to socialist revolution .
Based on our experiences of fighting in various places during the past year , we are keenly aware that the revolutionary tide has steadily declined .
Although Red political power has been established in a few small areas , there are as yet no democratic rights in
the nation as a whole .
The workers , peasants and even the bourgeois democrats have no right of speech or assembly , and the worst , crime is to join the Communist Party .
The Red Army has met with apathy everywhere it has gone ; it is only after propaganda work has been done that the masses come out slowly .
The Red Army has to fight hard battles , there being few or no instances of enemy defection or mutiny .
This is also true with the 6th Army , which recruited the most &quot; hooligans &quot; following the Ma @-@ jih ( 21 May ) incident .
This is merely fighting for the sake of fighting , and this method will not be conducive to victory .
This is so because there a nationwide revolutionary upsurge is completely lacking .
Under the ruthless feudal rule of the big gentry , the broad strength of the oppressed classes has not yet been mobilized , and consequently we have had to fight desultorily .
We are keenly aware of our isolation and hope that it will end soon .
In order for the revolution to reach its upsurge throughout the country , it will be necessary to launch and consummate political and economic democratic revolution which includes the bourgeoisie .
Thus , the resolution of the Comintern is most correct .
( 2 ) Policy Toward Petty Bourgeoisie : Up to February this year the work in the border area was done fairly well .
In March , Chou Lu , a representative of the Southern Hunan special committee , arrived at the border .
He said that we did not do enough killing and burning , and had failed to carry out the policy of &quot; converting the petty bourgeoisie into the proletariat , and then forcing them into the revolution , &quot; as a result of which the policy has been changed .
After the entire Red Army reached the border area in April , although there was still not much killing and burning , rigorous measures were carried out to confiscate the property of urban middle merchants and to squeeze the rural small landlords .
The slogan of the Southern Hunan special committee of &quot; All factories to the workers , &quot; has also been proselytized vigorously .
This policy of striking excessively at the petty bourgeoisie has resulted in driving the majority of them to the side of the big gentry .
They put on white ribbons to oppose us .
Recently , this policy has been changed gradually , and conditions have improved somewhat .
Salutary effects have been achieved in Sui @-@ chTuan particularly where the small merchants in the county and townships no longer tried to avoid us , and some even said good things about the Red Army .
Some 20,000 people are drawn to the market fairs in K &apos;o @-@ lin and Shang @-@ feng ( the fair is held every 3 days at noon ) which is unprecedented .
This proves that our policy has changed .
Previously , taxes were levied on all kinds of agricultural produce in transit , and heavy taxes were imposed by the pacification corps in Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan .
From Huang @-@ ao to Ts &apos;ao @-@ lin , a distance of only 70 li , there were five toll stations .
We abolished such exploitation by the feudal gentry and our action has been endorsed by the peasants and small merchants .
( 3 ) Since the Central Committee has asked us to promulgate a policy platform that includes the interests of the petty bourgeoisie , we suggest that the Central Committee enact a democratic revolutionary program which encompasses the interests of the workers , agrarian revolution and national liberation , as well as a list of slogans for guidance in the border area .
( 4 ) A unique characteristic of the Chinese revolution is that it is based on agriculture as its principal economy and uses armed forces to promote insurrections .
We suggest that the Central Committee exert great effort to develop the military movement .
This movement should be launched primarily in the enemy forces , with the development of the Red Army being secondary ,
( E ) The Question of the Area of the Independent Regime
The area from the Kwangtung border to the Hunan @-@ Kiangsi border , and even to southern Hupeh all belongs to the Lo @-@ hsiao mountain range geographically .
After traversing the entire Lo @-@ hsiao mountain range , we have found out that , comparatively speaking , the mid @-@ section of the range which centers on Ning @-@ kang is most suitable for our occupation .
The terrain in the northern section is not as good as the middle section , which can be used for both offensive and defensive purposes .
Moreover , it is too close to some of the big political centers .
Unless plans are under way for the rapid seizure of Changsha or Wuhan , it would be rather dangerous to station large forces in such places as Liu @-@ yang , Li @-@ ling , P &apos;ing @-@ hsiang and Tung @-@ ku .
Although the terrain in the southern section is better than that of the northern , its mass foundation is not as good as the middle section , arid its political impact on Kiangsi and Hunan is smaller .
On the other hand , any action in the middle section can have a tremendous impact on the lower river valleys of Hunan and Kiangsi .
A stocktaking of the advantages of the middle section reveals : ( a ) there is a mass foundation that has been built up for more than a year ; ( b ) the foundation of the party is strong ; ( c ) local armed forces with rich fighting experiences which has reached its present scope after more than a year of building up ; this force , supplemented by the 4th Red Army , cannot be annihilated by any enemy ; ( d ) an ideal military bastion in the Ching @-@ kang Mountains , and each county with its own armed bastions elsewhere ; ( e ) it can influence Hunan and Kiangsi , and the lower river valleys of these two provinces which , compared to southern Hunan and southern Kiangsi which can influence only one province or the upper river valley and the remote areas at that , is very different in political significance .
The setback of the middle section is that because it has been occupied for a long time , it is confronted with enormous enemy forces of suppression , and its economic problems , especially the problem of cash , are very serious .
The policy of the southern Hunan special committee toward us here was changed three times during a few weeks in June and July .
First , a message was delivered by Yuan Teh @-@ sheng which endorsed a plan to set up a government in the middle section .
Then , Tu Hsiu @-@ ching and Yang K &apos;ai @-@ ming came with the message that the Red Army should without any hesitation move toward southern Hunan , leaving only 200 rifles behind to protect the border area in conjunction with the Red Guards corps .
The letter also said that this policy is &quot; absolutely &quot; correct .
After only 10 days , Yuan Teh @-@ sheng returned with the message that the Red Army march for eastern Hunan which was also described as an &quot; absolutely correct &quot; policy .
The letter , besides scolding us at some
length , also wanted us to go &quot; without any hesitation , &quot; This rigid directive has placed us in &apos;a great predicament , because if we should disobey it , it would be disobedience on our part , and if we should observe it , it would mean certain defeat .
When the second message came , a joint meeting of the special committee , army committee and the county committee of Yung @-@ hsin was held .
The consensus was that it would be dangerous to go to southern Hunan , and we decided not to obey the views of the provincial committee .
A few days later , Tu Hsiu @-@ ching and Yang K &apos;ai @-@ ming insisted that the view of the provincial committee should be carried out .
The 29th Regiment which was composed mostly of recruits from southern Hunan , used the directive of the provincial committee as its excuse to pull the Red Army along to mount an attack on Ch &apos;en @-@ chou , This resulted in a disastrous defeat to the Red Army and the border area .
About one @-@ half of the Red Army was lost , while countless houses were destroyed and many people were slaughtered in the border area .
Other counties fell into enemy hands successively , and they have not been recovered even now .
In regard to eastern Hunan , before there is disruption in the political power of the big gentry in the three provinces of Hunan , Hupeh and Kiangsi , it is also inadvisable to send the main force of the Red Army there .
Had it not been for the inarch toward southern Hunan in July , it would have been possible to avert the border defeat in August , and , taking advantage of the fighting in Chang @-@ shu between Ch &apos;eng Ch &apos;ien &apos;s &#91; 4453 3383 &#93; 6th Army and Wang Chun &apos;s &#91; 3769 6874 &#93; forces , to smash the enemy at Yung @-@ hsin , thus engulfing Chi @-@ an and An @-@ fu and enabling the vanguards to reach P &apos;ing @-@ hsiang to link up with the 5th Army in the northern section .
Even so , our general headquarters should still have been in Ning @-@ kang , and only guerrilla units should have been sent to eastern Hunan .
Since fighting among the big gentry had not yet erupted , , and there were large enemy forces in P &apos;ing @-@ hsiang , Ch &apos;a @-@ ling and Yu @-@ hsien on the Hunan border , when our main force turned northward , it would have been overwhelmed by the enemy .
The Central Committee has deemed that it would be perilous to march either toward eastern Hunan or southern Hunan .
Although we have as yet had no experience in eastern Hunan , our experience in southern Hunan has borne out that once a wrong move is made , the entire game is lost .
Contact was lost between the border area , southern Hunan and the 5th Army stationed in P &apos;ing @-@ chiang and Liu @-@ yang , whole losses were also suffered at An @-@ yuan , This painful experience should be borne in mind at all times .
At present , the big gentry has not yet been broken up .
There are now 10 or more enemy regiments surrounding the border area .
If we can continue to find some cash resources ( the problem of food and clothing is not too .
serious ) , then , with what foundations we have already built up in the border area , it will be possible for us to cope with the existing enemy forces or even more .
For the sake of the border area , if the Red Army should depart , then the kind of trampling that happened in August may recur immediately .
Although they might not be able to completely annihilate our Red Guards units , the foundation of the party and the masses will be seriously damaged .
Although it might be possible to preserve some mountain strongholds in the manner of bandits , in the plains we would have to go underground as in August and September .
But if the Red Army should determine
to stay , it will be possible , with its existing foundations , , to gradually .expand to the surrounding areas , and the future will be bright .
For the sake of the Red Army , in order to bring about this expansion , a protracted struggle must be waged in the environs of the Ching @-@ kang Mountains ( namely : the four counties of Ning @-@ kang , Yung @-@ hsin , Ling @-@ hsien and Sui @-@ ch &apos;uan ) where we have a mass base .
In this situation , we can take advantage of the conflict of interest between the enemies in Hunan and Kiangsi which render it impossible for them to concentrate their forces against us .
We must also adopt some profitable strategy so that when we go out to fight we must be able to win , and with victory there will be captives which can be used to enlarge the Red Army gradually .
Thus , with the preparations made by the masses from April to July , if the Red Army had not gone to southern Hunan , it would have greatly expanded itself in August .
Although the mistake had been made , now that the Red Army has returned to the border area where the terrain is favorable and the people are friendly , the prospects are still good .
It is , therefore , necessary for the Red Army to be resolved to struggle and to have the stamina and patience in fighting before it can augment its arras and train good soldiers .
There is no other easy way than this .
The red flag has been hoisted in the border area for more than 1 year .
Although this has aroused the hatred of the big gentry in the three provinces of Hunan , Hupeh and Kiangsi , and even throughout the nation , nonetheless , this has also aroused the hopes of the workers , peasants and soldiers in the neighboring provinces .
Consequently , &quot; bandit suppression &quot; in the border area has been regarded by the warlords as an important event .
As has been said by Lu T &apos;i @-@ pTing &#91; 7627 3321 1627 &#93; , &quot; one year of bandit suppression has cost a million dollars , &quot; and by Wang Chun , &quot; though they claim to be 20,000 soldiers , they have only 5,000 rifles . &quot; Such laudatory propaganda like this has gradually attracted the attention of enemy soldiers and the enemy &apos;s lower @-@ echelon officers , and more and more will defect to our ranks .
This provides another source for the expansion of the Red Army .
Moreover , the fact that the red flag has flown over the border area consistently shows not only the strength of the Communist Party , but also proves the bankruptcy of the ruling class , and it is fraught with political significance nationally .
Thus , we deem that unless we have reached a dead end economically so that we will not be able to maintain ourselves unless we go to southern Kiangsi , we must not take such , a course .
Maybe we will go to southern Kiangsi when it comes to the end of the ropes , but this will be for economic reasons , not political reasons .
Politically , we have always deemed that the policy of establishing and expanding political power in the middle section of Lo @-@ hsiao mountain range both most necessary and entirely correct .
( F ) Communications and Others
( 1 ) Establishing of communication organs is extremely important .
We have handed over to comrades Yuan and Hsiao 200 yuan ( 4 ounces of gold ) and asked them to assume full responsibility in setting up the organ .
We will continue to be responsible for the funds .
The location should be at P &apos;ing @-@ hsiang .
A communications organ should also be set up at Chi @-@ an , which will be handled by the Kiangsi provincial committee .
( 2 ) When this letter was about finished , we received a letter from the Central Committee , The letter from Hunan contains circular No 47 ( oh the problem of secret organization ) f though we are still without the resolution on military work .
Besides , there is the letter from Comrade Yung @-@ hsien dated 15 August which said the letter and the circular from the Central Committee had not been received , and the three poems also cannot be found .
( 3 ) We have been able to get newspapers and so we are much happier than before when we did not see a newspaper for 2 or 3 months .
We still hope that you will keep us posted on political conditions and analyses ,
( 4 ) In regard to Tu Hsiu @-@ ching &apos;s error , the representatives &apos; conference of the southern expeditionary forces which reached Sha @-@ tTien in Kuei @-@ tung in August has decided to request the provincial committee to punish him because Tu represented that committee ,
( 5 ) The Front Committee has completely endorsed Mao Tse @-@ tung &apos;s letter to the provincial committee as well as his long letter to the Central Committee which will be forwarded thereto by Comrade Yuan .
( 6 ) Comrade Yuan Teh @-@ shenghas just returned to the provincial committee because he has had to wait for the discussion of and reply to the letter of the Central Committee ,
( 7 ) Hereafter , when you give any direction to us , please refer to our reports instead of basing unilaterally on the reports of inspectors .
The report made by Inspector Tu Hsiu @-@ ching to the provincial committee in June contains views that are entirely wrong ( such as , if the Red Guards have 200 more rifles , they will be able to defend the border area , and the Red Army was conservative , etc . ) - The provincial committee has made decisions on the basis of such reports , thus causing our defeat .
Moreover , when you give any directions on military movements in the future , they must not be too rigid .
The Central Committee &apos;s letter asked us to make our own choice in accordance with the environment , which is more flexible and so very proper .
During last winter and this spring the Hunan provincial committee and the southern Hunan special committee listened to the rumors of Su Hsien @-@ chun , a regimental commander who was dismissed from the party and later made secret charges which resulted in Kuo Liang &apos;s arrest , and Ho Chieh , a chief of staff who later was responsible for arson and murders in Chen @-@ chou .
This is even more dangerous , and please don &apos;t listen to irresponsible rumors and allegations .
( 8 ) Yang K &apos;ai @-@ ming is seriously ill , and Wan Hsi @-@ hsien has important assignment here , and so they cannot go to eastern Hunan .
( 9 ) The status of the Youth League will be reported to the provincial committee by the league &apos;s special committee .
( 10 ) This letter is written in three copies ; one being forwarded to the Central Committee care of the Hunan provincial committee ; one being forwarded to the Kiangsi provincial committee through the Hunan provincial committee ; and one being forwarded by the Chi @-@ an county committee to the Kiangsi provincial committee , and then to the Central Committee .
One of these is bound to be delivered duly .

&quot; Notice of the Fourth Army Hf
Hall of Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung * s Memorabilia
&quot; Notice of the Fourth Army Headquarters of the Red Army , &quot; Exhibition
HSING @-@ KUO COUNTY LAND LAW April 1929 &apos;
&#91; Text &#93; 1 .
All public land and land belonging to the landlord class are confiscated and made into the property of the Hsing @-@ kuo Worker @-@ Peasant @-@ Soldier Delegates &apos; Conference Government , to be allocated to peasants who own little or no land , for their cultivation and use .
After confiscation of all public land and land belonging to the land- &apos; owner class and allocation by the Worker @-@ Peasant @-@ Soldier Government , no land
may be bought or sold .
The criteria for land allocation are :
Use the population as the criterion and equally divide the land among the male and female , old and &quot; young , b .
Use the labor force as the criterion and allocate twice as much to those who can labor than those who cannot .
Of the above two criteria , the first should be followed , and the second is only for areas under special conditions .
The reasons for adopting the first criterion are :
Before the facilities for caring for the old and the young are completed , if the land allocation to them is too little , they will not be able to maintain a living .
It is simpler and more convenient to use the population as the criterion to divide the land . .
.
Very few households are without old and young members .
Meanwhile , though the old and the young do not have the ability to farm , the government may , after land allocation , assign them certain public service tasks , such as communication work .
The criteria for this area of land allocation are :
Use the township as the unit in land allocation , b .
Combine several townships as the unit in land allocation ( such as the Hsiao @-@ chiang area in
Yung @-@ hsin .
Use the district as the unit in land allocation .
Of the above three criteria , the first should be followedr and the second and third may be used under special conditions ,
The methods of dividing hills and woods are ;
The division of tea hills and firewood hills follows the method of land divisionequal division with the township as the unit ,
Bamboo hills belong to the soviet , but the peasants may have the use of the bamboo with its permission .
For less than 50 stalks , permission of the township soviet is required ; for less than 100 stalks , that of the district soviet is required ; and for over 100 stalks , that of the country soviet is required .
All bamboo is marketed by the county soviet , and the proceeds are handled by the superior soviet .
The levy of land taxes is as follows :
Land taxes are divided into three categories according to the production situation : ( 1 ) 15 percent ; ( 2 ) 10 percent ; ( 3 ) 5 percent .
Of the three categories above , the first one should be followed .
The second and third may be applied under special conditions with the approval of the supreme soviet .
In case of natural disaster or other special conditions , application for land tax exemption may be submitted to the superior soviet for its approval .
Land taxes are collected by the county soviet and transmitted to the superior soviet .
Rural handicraft workers may , if they so desire , receive a half share of the allocation to the peasants .
The officers and soldiers of the Red Army and Red Guards , and the personnel of the government and other public organs will receive land allocations in the same amount as the peasants , and the soviet will hire people to cultivate the land for them .
Note : This version of the land law was promulgated when the Red Army arrived at Hsing @-@ kuo in southern Kiangsi from the Ching @-@ kang Mountains in the 4th month after the formulation of the previous land law .
One important revision in the contents was to change &quot; the confiscation of all land &quot; to &quot; the confiscation of public land and land belonging to the landlord class . &quot; It was a fundamental change .
There was no other change .
Changes were mot made until 1930 .
Both land laws are kept to show the development of our understanding of the land struggle .

RESOLUTION OF THE NINTH CCP CONGRESS OF THE RED FOURTH ARMY West Fukien Ku @-@ t &apos;ien Conference , December 1929
&#91; Text &#93; I.
Rectification of Incorrect Tendencies Toward Non @-@ Proletarian Ideas in the Party
The many kinds of non @-@ proletarian ideas in the party in the Fourth Array exert an extremely powerful influence and constitute a great obstacle to the implementation of the partyTs correct line .
If not thoroughly rectified , the Fourth Army will definitely not be able to shoulder the tasks assigned it by China &apos;s extensive revolutionary struggle .
The source of such incorrect ideas naturally lies in the fact that the foundation of the party organization is largely built on peasants and other petty bourgeois &apos;elements ; yet the failure of the party &apos;s leading organs towage a concerted and determined struggle against such incorrect ideas and to educate the party members along the correct line is also an important cause for their existence and growth .
This Congress , in accordance with the spirit of the September letter of the Central Committee &quot; , now points out the sources and manifestations of the incorrect
tendencies of the many non @-@ proletarian ideas in the party in the Fourth Army and the methods of rectification and calls on the comrades to eliminate them thoroughly .
The Purely Military Viewpoint
The origin of the purely military viewpoint : .
A low political level .
Those with this viewpoint fail to understand political leadership and the fundamental difference between the missions of the Red Army and the White army .
The mercenary concept .
This is especially so in the numerous prisoners of war captured in the various campaigns who joined the Red Army and brought with them a strong mercenary concept , thus laying a foundation for the purely military viewpoint in the lower level .
From the two above factors arises the third , over @-@ confidence in military strength and lack of confidence in the strength of the masses .
The party &apos;s lack of active attention and discussion of military work is also a factor for the purely military viewpoint of some of the comrades ,
The purely military viewpoint is unusually widespread among a number of comrades in the Red Army .
Its manifestations ;
They regard military affairs and political work as opposed to each other , and fail to recognize military work as only one of the tools to accomplish the political tasks .
Some even declare : &quot; When military work is well done , political work is naturally done well ; when military work is not well done , political work cannot be well done either . &quot; This is to go one step farther and regard military work as leading political work .
They regard the task of the Red Army as similar to that of the White armymerely fighting .
They fail to recognize the fact that the Red Army is an armed force for carrying out the political tasks of the class .
In its work , especially in China today , the Red Army definitely does not exist merely for the sake of fighting .
Besides fighting , it must also shoulder such important tasks as agitating , organizing , arming and helping the masses , and building political power .
The Red Army does not fight merely for the purpose of fighting .
It fights in order to agitate , organize , arm and help the masses and build political power .
Apart from such objectives , fighting loses its meaning and the Red Army the reason for its existence .
Therefore , organizationally , they subordinate the political work organ to the military work organ and propose the slogan that &quot; the army headquarters deals with the public . &quot; If this idea continues to develop , it may lead to estrangement from the masses , to usurpation of political power by the army , and to a departure from the class positionsimilar to the path followed by the Kuomintang army .
Meanwhile , they overlook the importance of the propaganda team in propaganda work and ignore the soldiers1 council and the worker @-@ peasant masses in mass organization work .
As a result , both propaganda and organization work are abandoned .
They are conceited when a battle is won and dejected when one is lost .
They subscribe to departmentalism of the Fourth Army , approaching everything in the interest of the Fourth Army without understanding that to arm the local masses is one of the Red Army &apos;s important tasks .
This is an enlarged form of cliquism .
Limited by the immediate environment in the Fourth Army , a small number of comrades think that no other revolutionary force exists , resulting in the extremely deep @-@ rooted idea of conserving its strength by avoiding action .
This is a remnant of opportunism .
Disregarding the subjective and objective conditions , they suffer from revolutionary impetuosity , &quot; are unwilling to perform detailed and careful mass work , and only want to do big things , filling their rnind with illusions .
This is a remnant of adventurism .
The methods of rectification :
The political level of the party must be raised by means of education , and the theoretical source of the -military viewpoint eradicated .
The remnants of opportunism and adventurism must be eliminated , and the departmentalism of the Fourth Army broken down ,
The political training of the officers and soldiers must be intensified , especially the education of the captive elements during the period of their induction .
Meanwhile , local political power organs must select , as many as possible , worker and peasant elements with struggle experiences to join the Red Army , in order to weaken and eliminate the source of the simple military viewpoint organizationally .
Local party units must be activated to criticize the party in the Red Army and mass political power organizations ( soviets ) encouraged to criticize the Red Army , in order to influence the party and the officers and soldiers of the Red Army .
The party must actively pay attention to military work and hold discussions on it .
All tasks , after discussion and decision by the party , must be implemented through the mass line .
Rules and regulations must be formulated , clearly defining the tasks of the Red Army , the relations between the military work and political work organs , the relations between the Red Army and the masses , and the powers and functions of the soldiers &apos; council and its relationship with the military and political organs *
Ultra @-@ Democratization
After the party in the Red Army accepted the directives of the Party Central , ultra @-@ democratization has definitely diminished considerably , - That party resolutions are better implemented , and that such slpgans as Mdemocratic centralism from the bottom to the top &quot; and &quot; discussion at the lower level first before de &apos;cision by the higher level , &quot; for instance , are no longer heard are facts .
Nevertheless , such diminution is only superficial , and ultra @-@ democratization definitely has not been fundamentally eliminated from the mind of the party members in general .
In other words , the poison roots of ultra @-@ democratization still lie deep in the minds of many comrades .
The reluctance in carrying out resolutions is one of the instances .
Methods of rectification ;
The roots of ultra @-@ deroocratization must be eradicated .
First of all , it should be pointed out that its danger lies in the tendency to damage and even completely destroy the party organization , to undermine and even completely wipe out the party &apos;s fighting power , and to incapacitate the party from shouldering its fighting tasks , , thereby causing the failure of the revolution and prolonging the counterrevolutionary life of the ruling class .
Next , it should be pointed out that the source of ultra @-@ democratization lies in the nature of the petty bourgeoisie ( small farm production and urban small capital ) its individualistic aversion to discipline .
Such nature , having found its way into the party , manifests itself politically and organizationally as the idea of ultra @-@ democratization .
Such idea is basically incompatible with the fighting tasks of the proletariat .
Objectively , it is actually one of the counterrevolutionary ideas .
If not vigorously rectified , and if permitted to develop , those with such idea will inevitably follow the counterrevolutionary path .
Organizationally , the democratic way of life under centralized guidance must be strictly enforced .
The line for this is :
j ( l ) The party &apos;s leading organ must provide a correct line of guidance and find solutions when problems arise , in order to establish itself as a leading center .
( 2 ) The higher level organ must understand the conditions of the lower level organs and the life of the masses , in order to secure the social source of correct guidance .
( 3 ) The party organizations of all levels must not make decisions without due deliberation .
Once a decision is reached , it must be firmly implemented .
( 4 ) All decisions of any importance made by the party &apos;s higher level organs must be promptly transmitted to the lower level organs and the membership masses .
The method for doing so is to call activists meetings , party branch meetings , or even party membership mass meetings in the columns ( when circumstances permit ) and to assign men to make reports at such meetings .
( 5 ) The lower level organs of the party and the membership masses must discuss in detail the directives from the higher level in order to understand their significance thoroughly and decide on the methods of implementation .
The Non @-@ Organizational Viewpoint
The non @-@ organizational viewpoint in the party in the Fourth Army is manifested in many aspects .
The most apparent are the following three categories :
The minority refusing to obey the majority :
If a proposal is rejected , the individual concerned becomes extremely dissatisfied and is insincere in implementing the party &apos;s resolution .
This is one of the instances .
The methods of rectification :
At a meeting , all the people should be made to voice their opinions fully .
They must understand that the right and wrong sides over a controversial issue must be clearly established without compromise or equivocation .
Anything that cannot be settled at one meeting can be discussed at another ( provided no work is affected ) in order to reach a clear @-@ cut conclusion . &apos; .
-
Party discipline requires , among other things , that the minority obey the majority .
The minority , after their proposal has been rejected at a meeting and before the holding of the next meeting , must support the decision of the majority .
Besides bringing it up again at the next meeting , they must not show any opposition in their action .
Non @-@ organizational criticisms :
Inner @-@ party criticism is a weapon to re @-@ enforce the party organization and increase the party &apos;s fighting power .
Yet many in the Red Army do not understand this significance and erroneously use inner @-@ party criticism for personal attacks .
As a result , it damages not only the individuals but the party organization .
This is a manifestation of petty bourgeois individualism .
The method of rectification is to make the party members understand that the significance of criticism is to re @-@ enforce the party &apos;s fighting power in order to attain victory of the class struggle and that it must never be used as a tool for personal attacks .
Many party members make their criticisms not inside the party but outside it .
This is because of the failure to implant the political significance of the party organization into the concept of the party members in general ; therefore , they do not understand the importance of the party organization ( meetings , etc . ) , finding no difference between criticizing inside or outside the organization .
This may also result in leading the party to destruction .
The method of rectification is to implant the political significance of the party organization into the concept of the party members in general .
Only , thus will all the irresponsible non @-@ organizational criticisms giving the masses an unfavorable influence be wiped out .
&apos;3 .
Elitism of some party members :
On ground of being busy , some party members are actually unwilling to associate with the masses and fear their criticisms ; therefore , they do not attend the party branch mass meetings and cell meetings .
When they do attend , they do not make work reports .
In everything , they differentiate themselves from
the general party members .
As a result , they are severed from the masses , from the party .
On this point , the responsible persons of the party branch have not only failed to rectify the situation , but seemed to fear such elite party members .
The creation of this situation is due to the following reasons :
First , the Red Army has always made a serious error : The party organ seldom pays attention to the discussion of military affairs ; therefore , it has not urged the responsible comrades of the military affairs organ to make reports on military plans ( such as training , management and combat plans ) at party conferences .
As a result , party discussions are separated from military affairs , and the responsible military affairs comrades forget that they must accept party guidance and make reports to the party .
In consequence , the military affairs work of the Red Army becomes a special part not understood by the party organ and the general party members .
Thus , it not only greatly hampers the task of the militarization of the party members , bur also severs the party from military affairs , endangering the party &apos;s leadership of the army .
Next , due to the serious error of the party in its tasks discussed above , some of the responsible military affairs comrades have become an elite group in the party .
Meanwhile , the responsible comrades in charge of other work have also become elite individuals who are unwilling to attend meetings or to express themselves at meetings .
This is one reason for the party branch of the Red Army to become so abnormal and unsound .
The methods of rectification are : First , the meetings of all levels of the party ( from the party branch to the Front Committee ) must include the plans and reports of military affairs work in their daily agenda for discussion and decision .
Next , regardless of their functions , party members must attend party branch mass meetings and cell meetings and make work reports .
They must not be absent without cause .
Absolute Equalitarianism
At one time , absolute equalitarianism in the Red Army developed to a very serious extent .
After many struggles , it has certainly diminished considerably , but some dregs still remain , such as objecting to different allowances to the wounded soldiers according to the extent of the injury but insisting on equal amounts , denying the necessity for officers to ride horses in performing their duties but regarding riding as an inequality , demanding absolutely equal distribution of supplies and objecting to larger .
allotments to special cases , demanding equal assignment for all persons in carrying rice , regardless of age or physical condition , demanding equal space in billeting and even condemning the headquarters for occupying larger quarters , demanding equal assignnent of duties and refusing any extra work , and even abandoning both wounded men when there is only one stretcher rather than carrying only one of them .
All such instances indicate that absolute equalitarianism among the Red Army officers and soldiers has not been fundamentally eradicated from the mind of the masses .
Whatever that has been eradicated is merely partial or superficial .
Similar to ultra @-@ democratization in politics , absolute equalitarianism is a product of the handicraft and small peasant economy , except that one is manifested in the political aspect and the other in the material aspect ,
The method of rectification is as follows ; It must be pointed out theoretically that not only is absolute equalitarianism merely an illusion of the peasants and petty bourgeois in the days before the disappearance of capitalism but , even in the period of the socialist economy , material distribution must be adjusted to the needs of the individuals and.the &apos; tasks .
There definitely cannot be absolute equality .
The maximum equality in material distribution in the Red Army should be attained , such as equal pay and equal rations for the officers and men , because it is the need of the struggle in the current environment .
But absolute equality beyond reason must be opposed , because it is not the need of the struggle .
On the contrary , it will hamper the struggle .
The Idealist Concept
The idealist -concept is extremely serious among party members in the Red Army , and it constitutes an extremely great obstacle to political analysis , work guidance , and the party organization .
The inevitable accompanying result of idealist analysis of politics and idealist guidance of work is either opportunism or adventurism .
As for the idealist critical spirit inside the party , random talk not based on evidence , or mutual suspicion , it often leads to controversies in the party not involving principles and without significance and to disruption of the party organization .
In regard to the issue of inner @-@ party criticisms , besides the idealist critical spirit , we should also mention the non @-@ political critical spirit .
The major function of criticism is to point out political errors .
Pointing out organizational errors comes next .
As for defects in personal life and minor technical mistakes , if they are not closely connected with political or organizational errors , it is not necessary to be so censorious as to place the comrades concerned in a quandary .
Moreover , once technical criticisms develop , the attention of the party may become entirely diverted to commonplace technical trivialities , and everyone may become cautious and timorous , thereby forgetting the party &apos;s political tasks .
This is the greatest danger .
Similar to the unscientific idealist critical spirit , the inner @-@ party technical and non @-@ political critical spirit in the Red Army will inevitably produce ( and has already prpduced ) the worst result .
.2 .
The only method of rectification is to raise the political and scientific levels of the party members in their thinking and inner @-@ party life .
To attain this goal , it is necessary to : a .
Educate the party members to make political analysis and class strength assessment with the Marxist method , in order to replace the idealist method of analysis and assessment , b .
Make the party members pay attention to survey and study of the social economy as a basis to determine the struggle strategy and work method , so that the comrades know that , apart from practical survey , they will fall into the abyss
of fantasy and adventurism .
Eliminate the idealist and technical spirit in inner @-@ party criticism , basing all statements on evidence and giving attention to the political significance when discussing work .
Individualism
The individualist tendency in the party in the Red Army manifests itself as follows :
Vindictiveness : After being criticized inside the party by a soldier comrade , the individualist will seek a chance to retaliate outside the partybeating or scolding is one way of retaliation .
There are many such instances .
Sometimes , retaliation is sought inside the party : You attack me at this meeting , so I shall retaliate by finding fault with you at the next .
There are also many instances of such .
Such vindictiveness proceeds solely from the personal viewpoint .
The individualist is ignorant of class interest or party life as a whole .
He only knows himself .
His target is not the enemy class but other individuals in his1 own ranks .
It is a corrosive which can weaken the organization and its fighting power .
Cliquism : On the surface , it is an expanded individualism , but underneath , it is still the narrow individualism .
It also produces a strong corrosive and centrifugal effect .
In the Red Army , cliquism has all along been rampant ; although it has now become less serious as a result of criticism , its remnants still exist and further struggle is needed .
The mercenary concept : A person with a mercenary concept fails to recognize that the party and the Red Army are the tools to implement the class tasks , and that he , himself , is a member thereof .
He fails to realize that he , himself , plays a main role in the struggle , but feels that the struggle has nothing to do with himself , and that he is responsible only to the superior officers of the Red Army or the party organ , not to the revolution .
Such mercenary concept of revolution is rather widespread in the Red Army .
It is the reason why there are not many unconditional , enthusiastic , and positive activists .
If the mercenary concept is not eliminated , the number of positive activists will not increase , and the heavy burden of revolution will always rest on the shoulders of a few , much to the detriment of the struggle .
Hedonism : In the Red Army , there are also quite a few whose individualism finds expression in hedonism .
They constantly hope that the troops will march to the big cities .
They want to go there not to work but to enjoy themselves .
What they dislike most is to work in the Red areas where life is hard .
The result of hedonism is thinking of personal interest only , without consideration of the entire revolution or group action .
Passive slowdown : With the least bit of dissatisfaction , an individual with this tendency becomes passive and slows down in his work .
Though the basic reason is individualism , because he has not accurately recognized his
own class tasks , there are also objective reasons such as improper handling of incidents , work assignments , or enforcement of discipline in the party and the army .
The desire to leave the army : The number of .people who ask for transfer from the ranks to local work is on the rise , This is not entirely due to subjective individualism , but also to ( 1 ) the material hardships in the Red Army ; ( 2 ) exhaustion after a long struggle ; and ( 3 ) objective environmental reasons of improper handling of incidents , work assignments or enforcement of discipline .
The origin of individualism is the influence of the small peasant and bourgeois ideologies in the party .
The method of rectification is mainly through education , rectifying individualism in thinking .
Next , the handling of incidents , work assignments and enforcement of discipline must be proper .
In addition , measures must be taken to improve the material life of the Red Army , utilizing all opportunities for rest and rehabilitation , in order to better the objective conditions ,
G , The Idea of Roving Insurgents
1 , The origin of the idea of roving insurgents in the Red Army is as follows : a .
Homeless proletarians constitute the majority of the Ked Army .
This is the immediate cause , b .
The remote cause is the existence &apos; of large groups of vagrants throughout the country , especially the southern provinces .
With these two causes , the political thinking and action with the idea of roving insurgents are created in the Red Army .
However , in today &apos;s China under imperialist control , especially with the import of advanced weapons ( grenades , steel cannon , machine guns , etc . ) , advanced communication methods ( military telephones and radios ) , and advanced transport means ( motor vehicles , steamships , railways ) , the large @-@ scale roving insurgent actions in the style of Huang Ch &apos;ao , Li Ch &apos;uang or Hung Hsiu @-@ ch &apos;uan are no longer feasible ; therefore , the idea of roving insurgents naturally cannot become the final and effective idea of the Red.Array in its actions .
Nevertheless , its influence , as manifested in the various aspects , is still very strong , such as ; a .
being unwilling to help the masses build political power by strenuous work for the purpose of expanding political influence , but thinking only of accomplishing the purpose by the mobile guerrilla method ; b .
in the organizational line of expanding the Red Army , following not the line of expanding the local Red Guard , the local units of the Red Army , or even the non @-@ local units of the Red Army , but the line of &quot; recruiting soldiers and buying horses &quot; and &quot; recruiting captives and accepting rebels &quot; ; c , being impatient to wage a hard struggle together with the masses , but only hoping to go to the big cities to eat and drink .
All such manifestations of the idea of roving insurgents seriously hamper the Red Army in performing the momentous tasks assigned it by the revolution .
Thus , the elimination of this idea is indeed one of the Important goals of the inner @-@ party ideological struggle in the Red Army .
The methods of rectification :
Change the incorrect ideas in the party coming from the vagrant elements through education in order to eliminate the idea of roving insurgents .
Intensify the anti @-@ vagabondism education of the current basic troops of the Red Army and future captives .
Recruit active elements among the workers and peasants with struggle experiences to join the current ranks of the Red Army in order to change its components .
Raise new troops from the struggling workers @-@ peasant masses .
Remnants of Adventurism
The party in the Red Army has exerted a great effort in the struggle against adventurism hut not yet to the full extent .
Therefore , remnants of adventurism still exist in the Red Army even though much of the adventurist idea and action has been overcome .
Adventurism comes from a combination of the lumpen proletarian ideology and the petty bourgeois ideology .
Its manifestations are : a .
Blind action without regard of the subjective and objective conditions , b .
Inadequate and irresolute implementation of urban policies , c .
Slack military discipline , especially when suffering a defeat .
Setting fire to houses without consideration of the mass foundation , which is a misconduct to varying extents in all the units , e .
The practice of executing deserters and of corporal punishment which are partially due to adventurism .
The methods of rectification : a * Eliminate adventurism theoretically .
.b.
Rectify adventurist actions by systems and policies .
Organization of the Party
The issue of the party organization in the Red Army has reached a very critical stage especially the inferior quality of the party members and the slack organization , which affect the leadership of the Red Army and the implementation of policies .
The Congress has made a careful analysis of the issue and coine to a decision .
The comrades must follow the spirit of the Congress and strive to reform the party organization , in order to enable it to truly shoulder the party &apos;s political tasks .
Only then can we consider it successful .
The Party &apos;s Organizational Line
1 , The combat soldiers are the main objectives in the development line of party members .
Meanwhile , the noncombatants , such as porters and orderlies , must not be neglected .
A party branch must be organized in every company and a cell in every squad .
This is one of the important principles of party organization in the army .
In units where the number of party members is tpo small and a cell cannot actually be organized , the platoon may be used temporarily as the unit to organize a cell and its members must be assigned systematically to the squads .
But it must be understood that this is only a transitional measure .
The current organization method of cells in the Red Army , i.e. , the method of mixing the cadre and general elements and the intellectual and laboring elements is correct , but those with different occupations and different abilities must also be systematically and successfully mixed when organizing .
Hereafter , more attention must be given to this point .
As for simply organizing the cadres into cells , it is undesirable .
The Slack Organization of the Party
The current situation of the party organization in the Fourth Army :
Enrollment is too easy .
Many without the proper qualifications are also dragged into the party , especially officers , who do not have to satisfy any requirement to join the party .
Therefore , the quality of the party has become very inferior .
The party units of the various levels solve the problems in their work but forget the task of educating the comrades .
There are very few training meetings , such as activists mass meetings , joint meetings of secretaries and propaganda sections , joint meetings of committees , party branch mass meetings , column or detachment party members &apos; mass meetings .
Discipline in general is lax .
This is especially true in regard to individuals in charge of important work and who are irreplaceable .
Their mistakes are often overlooked , and discipline is not enforced .
When one person is treated this way , others have to be treated the same way .
Thus , discipline in general is slackened .
All the officers are party members .
As a result , all those working in military affairs and political organs pay little attention to their social occupational work , feeling that social occupational work is party work and failing to distinguish the two .
The military affairs work conferences and the political work conferences of the various levels are almost never held .
They think that , whatever it is , once it is decided by the party , that is the end of it .
That the party .member produces a nucleus effect in social occupation is never discussed ,
The higher and lower levels do not have a close relationship .
The higher level seldom comments or makes instructions on the reports of the lower level , and it seldom sends men to attend the meetings of the latter .
While this is due to the lack of soundness , of the organization of the higher
level , the lack of positivity in its work attitude is also one of the reasons for the absence or inadequacy of its guidance of the lower level .
This is especially true in regard to directing practical work , such as the lack of detailed instructions to units embarking on guerrilla work .
In some units , even rough guidance is almost nonexistent .
Many party branch mass meetings and cell meetings are not held on time .
The line of rectification : .
The old foundation must be thoroughly overhauled .
Those with erroneous political concepts , smoking opium , making illegal profits , or gambling , and refusing to reform after many warnings , be they cadres or not , must all be expelled from the party .
The requirements for new party members hereafter :
( 1 ) No mistake in political concept ( including class awareness ) .
( 2 ) Honesty .
( 3 ) Possessing the spirit of sacrifice , and able to work positively .
( 4 ) No desire for illegal profits .
( 5 ) Abstinence from opium and gambling .
Only those meeting all five requirements will be introduced into the party .
The introducer must verify in advance whether the introduced truly satisfies the requirements , and the necessary procedure of introduction must be followed .
After joining the party , the new member must be informed in detail the party branch life ( including secret work ) and the important points to be observed by party members .
The introducer must shoulder certain responsibilities toward the introduced .
The party branch committee must assign someone to interview the membership applicant and ascertain his qualifications .
.c.
In addition to solving problems and directing practical work , the party units of the various levels also have the tremendous task of educating the comrades .
They must systematically hold all kinds of training conferences and other modes of training , such as training classes and discussion meetings .
Discipline must be strictly enforced , and the practice of merely paying lip service to discipline stopped .
The natures of the party members &apos; social occupation and their party work must be distinguished .
Each and every party member must undertake a social occupation , and perform the work assigned him by the party in his social occupation ( except those responsible for important functions or specialized tasks in the party who are professional revolutionaries ) .
The work attitude of the party units of all levels must become more positive than ever before .
The lower level must make detailed reports to the higher level , and the latter must discuss and reply to such reports in detail and , whenever possible , assign men to attend the meetings of the lower level .
It must not borrow the excuses of shortage of personnel , inadequate work capacity , and insufficient time to cover up its own lack of enthusiasm and negligence in work .
The party branch committee and the party units above it must systematically decide on the material for discussion at the party branch mass meetings and cell meetings every month , determine the meeting schedules , and strictly enforce the holding of meetings .
How to Make the Meetings Interesting
The reasons for the party members &apos; lack of interest in attending meetings
They do not understand the significance of meetings .
The important significance of the party branch meeting is primarily to solve problems .
All struggle and internal problems must be solved by concentrated discussion at the meetings .
If a party member does not attend , or if he does not actively express his opinions when attending , it will indicate his failure to understand the political significance of the meeting and his lack of interest in struggle .
Anyone with a positive feeling toward struggle will attend the meetings enthusiastically and express himself eagerly .
The next significance is to educate the comrades .
Meetings not only solve problems but , in the process of solving problems , the circumstances of the problems must be investigated and the instructions of the higher level studied , thus activating the mind and talent of the comrades .
As the meetings become political and practical , the mind of the comrades also become political and practical .
Then , the party &apos;s fighting power is increased .
This is the educational .significance of meetings .
The failure of the party members of the Red Army to understand such significance constitutes the first reason for their nonattendance or lack of interest .
When resolutions are not implemented or inquiries to the higher level are not answered for a prolonged period , the party members lose interest in the discussions .
The responsible persons fail to make proper preparations in advance , to formulate an agenda , to clarify the contents and circumstances of the problems , or to form some opinions ahead of time on the solution of the problems .
The chairman often interrupts at will a party member .
When a statement is slightly off the subject under discussion , the chairman will immediately stop him , and the party member becomes discouraged and keeps quiet .
If there is any mistake in the statement , the chairman will also ridicule him in addition to stopping him .
The feudal style order of meeting is inflexible and sterotyped , and attending a meeting is similar to- sitting in jail .
The methods of rectification :
First , the meetings must become political and practical .
Second , the comrades must constantly be reminded of the important significance of meetings , especially in regard to new members and members who are not positive in their work .
Third , resolutions must not be passed lightly .
Once a resolution is passed , it must be firmly implemented .
Fourth , the higher level must be prompt in answering the questions of the lower level .
It must not delay too long , causing the lower level to lose its fervor .
Fifth , the responsible persons must prepare the agenda in advance .
They must make the agenda concrete , clarify in advance the contents and circumstances of the problems , and give some prior thought to the solutions .
Sixth , the chairman must handle the meeting skillfully and channel the current of discussion toward the topic on hand .
However , should there be any development of important significance beyond the topic , he must not only refrain from interrupting the speaker and discouraging him , but must carefully seize upon the development , introduce it to everyone , and form a new topic of discussion .
Only then will the meeting become interesting , the problems truly solved and the educational significance of the meeting truly realized .
Seventh , the feudal order of meeting must be abolished .
The meeting of communist party members must reflect the positive , lively and joyful spirit of the proletariat and incorporate it into the order of the meeting .
Youth Organization in the Party in the Red Army and Its Work
The interests of the youths and adults in the troops cannot be separated , and the league has no special work objectives .
Moreover , only when the party cell is built with the squad as the unit will it benefit the struggle .
Therefore , there is no necessity to establish league cells in the party
branch .
As the youths among the party members possess different feelings from the adults , besides general party training , they must receive a special youth education .
.Furthermore , in view of the fact that righting for the young worker @-@ peasant masses is one of the party &apos;s important tasks , there must be a special organization to handle it .
Therefore , young party members in the party under 20 years of age ( except those under special conditions , such as being in charge of the party &apos;s important work ) must be assigned to form a youth work conference .
In regard to such conferences , besides regular and systematic meetings with the battalion as the unit , the detachments and columns must also deliberate on the time and call meetings .
For @-@ the purposes of planning the education of youth party members , devising means to fight for the young worker @-@ peasant masses , and directing the youth work conference , five @-@ member youth work committees must be formed in the Front Committee and column committee , and youth commissars appointed in the detachment committee and party branch committee , under the guidance of party units of the various levels .
Relationship Between the Political Commissar and Inner @-@ Party Work
Party secretaries of battalion and detachment levels must not , in principle , also serve as political commissars .
However , in units with personnel shortage , they may temporarily serve in both capacities , In regard to political commissars who do not also serve as party secretaries , the higher level party unit must study the situation and , under suitable circumstances , assign them as special emissaries of the party with the duty of directing the party work of their levels .
.
&apos;
The Highest Party Organization of Directly Subordinate Units
The directly subordinate units of the army and the columns must organize directly subordinate unit committees as the highest party organizations , consisting of five to seven members .
The Question of Establishing Party and Youth League Organizations in Soldiers &apos; Associations
No party or youth league organizations should be established in soldiers &apos; associations at the battalion level , and the work of these associations should be guided by the party branch committees concerned ; but party and youth league organizations should be established in soldiers &apos; associations at the column level , and the work of these organizations should be guided by the party committees of the columns concerned .
Inner @-@ Party Education A.
Significance
Education must be considered the most urgent issue in the party in the Red Army .
For the purpose of improving and expanding the Red Army and enabling it to shoulder the struggle tasks , we must start from inner @-@ party education .
If the political level in the party is not raised , if the many biases are not eliminated , we definitely cannot improve and expand the Red Army , nor enable it to shoulder the momentous struggle tasks .
Therefore , carrying out planned @-@ inner @-@ party.education and correcting the unplanned and laissez @-@ faire situation of the past constitute one of the important tasks of the party .
The Congress has decided to educate the party members with the following materials and methods .
The leading organs of the party must hold more detailed discussions to implement the task .
Materials .
Political analyses .
Discussion of documents from higher level leading organs .
Organization knowledge .
Rectification of eight erroneous ideas in the party in the Red Army .
Discussion of anti @-@ opportunism and the opposition faction against Trotskyism .
6 . Strategy and technique of mass work ,
, Survey and study of the social economy of guerrilla areas ,
8 . Study of Marxism @-@ Leninism ,
9 . Study of social economics .
10 . The current stage of the revolution and its future .
Of the 10 items above , except for a portion ( such as the study of social economics ) which actually is limited to the cadres , they are all suitable for the general party members .
Methods
Party newspapers .
Brief political reports .
All types of pamphlets for educating the comrades .

&#124; Propaganda Work of the Red Army
A * Significance of the Propaganda Work of the Red Army
i
The &apos; goal of the propaganda work of the Red Army is to expand our political influence and fight for the broad masses .
Only when this goal is realized will the general goal of the Red Army , such as organizing the masses , arming the masses , building political power , eliminating the reactionary forces , and promoting the revolutionary high tide , be realized .
Therefore , propaganda work is the foremost task of the Red Army .
Overlooking it is abandoning the main task of the Red Army and equivalent to helping the ruling class undermine its power .
Current Situation of the Propaganda Work of the Red Army
Defects of the propaganda contents :
a , No concrete political outline has been published .
( The political out- .
lines published before , such as the four @-@ word announcements , were not concrete . )
Propaganda and encouragement of the daily struggles of the masses are overlooked .
c . Winning of the urban poor is overlooked .
d . Propaganda to the women masses is overlooked .
e . Propaganda to the youth masses is inadequate .
f . Propaganda to the lumpen proletariat is inadequate ,
Propaganda against the armed organizations of the landowner class ( Civil League , Ching @-@ wei League , etc . ) is very little ,
There is no proper choice of time and place in propaganda ,
*
Defects of the propaganda technique : a .
The propaganda team is not sound .
( 1 ) The number of propagandists has been reduced from five per battalion to three , or even down to one .or two , or none .
( 2 ) The quality of the propagandists is too inferior .
They include captives , cooks , grooms , opium smokers , suspected deserters who are disarmed , those who failed as clerks , and cripples unwanted by other work units .
Today &apos;s propaganda team has actually become a receiving station and is completely incapable of performing its duties .
( 3 ) Almost all the officers and soldiers reject the propaganda team , ( partly because of the inferior quality of the propagandists and their lack of achievement , resulting in the dissatisfaction of others ) .
&quot; Loafers &quot; and &quot; fake medicine peddlars &quot; are the nicknames given them .
( 4 ) The propaganda teams do not have adequate funds .
( 5 ) The training of the propagandists is not systematic , nor the supervision of their work adequate .
Therefore , the work of the propaganda team is very sketchy , and no one pays any attention whether it does anything or not .
The handbills , announcements and declarations are outmoded and stale , and distribution and mailing are not properly handled .
There are very few wall bulletins ; the brief political reports are too simple in content ar.d too few ; and the characters are too small and too hard to read .
d . There is practically no revolutionary songs ,
e . Only a few pictorials have been published ,
f . There is no costumed propaganda .
Clubs with the double significance of recreation for the soldiers and association with the worker @-@ peasant masses have not been organized .
Verbal propaganda is too little and too inferior .
The discipline of the Red Army is a practical propaganda to the masses .
Now discipline is more lax than before ; therefore , it produces an unfavorable impression on the masses .
Putting up the gate boards , bundling rice straw , sweeping the floor , friendliness in conversation , fair buying and selling , returning intact borrowed things , and reimbursing for losses all constitute a kind of the Red Army &apos;s propaganda work , but now they are not fully performed .
Mass meetings are seldom held , and not successful when held .
The method of propagandizing to the White soldiers is not good , C.
The Lines of Rectification 1 .
Propaganda contents :
A concrete political program should be published , and be called the &quot; Red Army Political Program . &quot;
Propaganda must be compatible with the struggle sentiments of the masses .
Besides the general riot slogans , there must also be slogans on daily life , in conjunction with the riot slogans , in areas where the struggle sentiments of the masses are still low , in order to activate the daily struggles .
The urban poor ( middle and small merchants and students ) constitutes a considerable strength in the civil rights revolution .
Overlooking this strength is equivalent to presenting it to the big business bourgeoisie .
Hereafter , in regard to the urban middle and small merchant and student masses , intensive propaganda work must be performed in order to win them over .
i d .
Women constitute half of the population .
The economic position of the
laboring women and the extreme oppression suffered by them not only indicate that they are in urgent need of revolution but also that they will constitute
a determining force of the revolution .
Hereafter , there must be effective slogans and extensive propaganda toward theiq ,
The toiling youth masses constitute over 30 percent of the population , and they are also the bravest and firmest in struggle .
Therefore , propaganda to win the youth masses is an important task in the entire propaganda program .
In regard to China &apos;s broad lumpen masses , if they take the side of the revolutionary class , they will , become an instrument of the revolution ; if they take the side of the reactionary class , they will become an instrument of the counterrevolution .
Therefore , winning them over from under the influence of the reactionary class is one of the party &apos;s propaganda tasks .
When performing propaganda work , attention must be given to the life and nature of the .different groups of vagrants and appropriate propaganda measures adopted .
The destruction of the armed organizations of the landlord class and the winning over of their masses constitute one of the conditions for the victory of the rural land revolution .
Hereafter , special attention must be given to the propaganda work on the membership masses of the civil defense and pacification units .
The propaganda and agitation slogans must be adapted to the particular areas , and different slogans must also be created according to the different times ( such as fall harvest , year @-@ end , the Chiang &#91; 5592 &#93; -Kuei &#91; 2710 &#93; war period and the Wang &#91; 3076 &#93; -Chiang &#91; 5592 &#93; war period ) .
Propaganda technique : a .
The propaganda team :
( 1 ) Significance : The Red Army propaganda team is an important tool of its propaganda work .
If the propaganda team is not well organized , a large part of the Red Army &apos;s propaganda task is wasted .
Therefore , the reform and training of the propaganda team is one of the tasks at present requiring the party &apos;s re @-@ enforced endeavor .
The first step is to correct , from the theoretical aspect , the contempt felt by the officers and soldiers for propaganda work and propaganda teams .
Such odd nicknames as &quot; loafers &quot; and &quot; fake medicine peddlers &quot; must be deleted hereafter .
( 2 ) Organization :
( a ) Take each detachment as a unitj the detachments directly subordinate to the army and column command will eacn form a Unit .
Each unit will organize a propaganda team composed of a commander and a deputy commander , 16 propagandists , 1 porter ( carrying propaganda materials ) , and 2 orderlies .
The propagandists of each company are divided into a number of subunits ( the number of subunits to be decided according to the number of battalions or other troop units and organs ) and each subunit has a leader and three propagandists .

( d ) In regard to improving the quality of the propagandists , besides requesting the local governments to select progressive elements to join the Red Army propaganda team , the superior elements among the soldiers in the various units must be selected ( excluding the squad leaders wherever possible ) to serve as propagandists .
The political department must regularly formulate training plans for the propaganda team , specify the training material , method , time and instructors , and actively improve the quality of the propagandists .
In regard to the propaganda documents , such as handbills , announcements and declarations , the existing ones should be reviewed , and new ones drafted promptly .
The suitable and effective distribution of propaganda material is an important item in the technique of the propaganda team .
The political work organs must give attention to such means as sending propaganda by mail , enclosing propaganda material among other matters through the mail , or printing propaganda and agitation slogans on postal matters , and they must do so successfully .
Wall bulletins are one of the important means of mass propaganda .
The army and the columns must each run a wall bulletin , to be handled by the propaganda section of the political department and named &quot; Current Affairs Brief Report . &quot; The contents are : ( 1 ) International and domestic political news ; ( 2 ) the mass struggle situation of guerrilla areas ; ( 3 ) the work condition of the Red Army .
There must be at least one issue a week , written on large pieces of paper , not mimeographed , in as many copies as possible .
Attention must be given to the following : ( 1 ) The production must be prompt ; ( 2 ) the contents must be rich ; and ( 3 ) the calligraphy should be fairly large and clear .
The various political departments must collect and compile revolutionary songs expressing the sentiments of the masses , and the editing and compiling committee of the army political department has the responsibility of supervision and inspection .
The art unit of the propaganda section of the army political department must be reenforced .
It must publish lithographed or mimeographed pictorials .
To reenforce the military art unit , all those with talent in painting and drawing in the army must be gathered together .
ISA
Costumed propaganda is one of the most concrete and effective means of propaganda .
All the propaganda teams of the detachments and directly subordinate units must organize costumed propaganda subunits , responsible for creating and directing costumed propaganda to the masses .
Take each battalion as a unit , clubs must be organized in the soldiers&apos;
associations .
Verbal and written propaganda subunits must be organized in the propaganda teams , for the purpose of studying and directing verbal and written propaganda techniques .
The three disciplinary rules must be strictly enforced .
The political departments and the propaganda teams must , with organization and planning , call all types of mass meetings .
They must decide in advance the order of meeting , the speakers , the topics and the time .
Propaganda aimed at the soldiers and lower level officers of the White army is extremely important .
Attention must be given to the following methods hereafter :
( 1 ) The text of the propaganda must be short and concise , so that it can be read at a glance .
It must be skillful and clever , so that it will leave an impression .
( 2 ) Besides systematically displaying many .slogans appropriate to the particular units along the road traveled by the enemy , handbills must be stored with the party units and mass organizations along the road , so that they can be ingeniously distributed when the enemy soldiers pass through .
( 3 ) The names of the enemy officers and soldiers and the identity of their unit must be ascertained from the captives and through mail inspection , so that propaganda material or letters can be sent to them .
( 4 ) Preferential treatment of captives is an effective method of propagandizing to the enemy force .
Preferential treatment includes the following methods : The first is to refrain from searching them for money and things .
In the past , the conduct of the Red Army soldiers of searching captives for money and things must be firmly stopped .
The second is to welcome captives with great warmth , so that they will feel a spiritual happiness .
Insulting them by word or deed must be opposed .
The third is equal material treatment of the captives , same as the old soldiers .
Fourth , after propaganda , those who do not wish to remain will be issued travel expenses and released for them to return home , so that they will spread the influence of the Red Army in the White army .
Forcing the unwilling ones to remain just to satisfy the desire for more soldiers must be opposed .
Except under special conditions , the above are suitable for all captured officers and soldiers alike .
( 5 ) Giving medical attention to the enemy wounded is also an effective method of propaganda .
The medical treatment and monetary allowances to wounded enemy soldiers must be exactly the same as wounded Red Army soldiers .
All possible opportunities must be utilized to return wounded enemy soldiets who have received medical attention and monetary allowances , to the enemy army .
This principle applies to wounded enemy officers .

Method
Political classes ;
Political classes are divided into regular , special and cadre classes .
Regular classes are further divided into two types : When a detachment is together , classes are held with each detachment as a unit .
For instructors , the detachment political commissar serves as the instructor in charge , and battalion political commissars are responsible for the various subjects separately .
Besides combat soldiers who are required to attend , messengers , orderlies , porters , grooms and cooks must all attend .
The goal of the regular class is basic political knowledge for soldiers in general .
With each detachment as a unit , the special class , through selection and examination , consists of 50 soldiers from the battalions who can
read some and have some political knowledge .
The detachment political commissar serves as the instructor in charge , and the battalion political commissars are responsible for the various subjects separately .
The goal of the special class is to create personnel with political knowledge one level higher than the regular class , in preparation for promotion to lower level cadres in the future .
The column is the unit for the cadre class , and the directly subordinate unit of the army forms another unit , organized with battalion commanders and deputy commanders , company commanders and deputy commanders , military aides of the various levels , and other designated personnel .
The goal is to raise the political level of the current lower level cadres , so that they can lead the masses , in preparation for promotion to middle level cadres in the future .
The political commissar , political department chairman , and commander of the column and others with suitable qualifications serve as the instructors .
The political.training committee must be organized with each detachment as a unit , to include the political committee members of the detachment and qualified military officers .
The detachment political commisssar serves as chairman .

Abolition of Corporal Punishment
The Effect of Corporal Punishment in the Red Army
In the units where corporal punishment is more severe , there are more dissatisfied soldiers and deserters .
There were the following most apparent instances : A certain officer of the 8th detachment of the 3d column liked to punish by flogging .
As a result , not only almos &apos;t all the messengers and cooks , but even the supply sergeant and aides , fled .
During one period , a battalion commander who liked to flog people was assigned to the 25th battalion of the 9th detachment .
The masses nicknamed him &quot; Ironsmith . &quot; In consequence , the soldiers felt hopeless and utterly dissatisfied .
They only became liberated when the commander was transferred .
The .result of flogging in the 3d battalion of the special service detachment was the desertion of 4 cooks , 1 special service chief and 2 squad leaders who had struggled for a long time .
One of them , Hsiao Wen @-@ ch &apos;eng &#91; 5618 2429 2052 &#93; , left a letter , explaining that he was not counterrevolutionary , but deserted because he could not stand the oppression .
When the 4th column was first organized , the officers transferred from the 1st , 2d and 3d columns beat the soldiers savagely .
As a result , the soldiers deserted one after another .
Finally , this group of officers themselves could not stand their ground , and they had to leave the 4th column .
The 2d column has more deserters than any other column .
Though there are many reasons , the habit of flogging intensively practiced by its lower level officers is one of the most important ones .
There were three suicide incidents in the 2d column ( 1 platoon leader and 2 soldiers ) .
This is the biggest stigma of the Red Army , and the significance is extremely serious .
It cannot but be considered an outcome of flogging practiced intensively in the 2d column .
Currently , the outcry of the common soldiers in the Red Army is : &quot; Officers do not beat the soldiers ; they merely flog them to near death ! &quot; Such expression of the indignation and wrath of the masses truly deserves our serious attention .
The Origin of Corporal Punishment and the Reason for Its Abolition
To maintain its exploitation , the feudal class had to resort to the most cruel punishment as a tool , In order to suppress the resistance and revolt of the exploited .
This was the reason that corporal punishment was created in the feudal era .
When economic development progressed to the capitalist system , it became necessary to introduce liberalism in order to encourage the individuality of the worker @-@ peasant masses , enhance their labor and fighting capacities , and create the conditions for the development of capitalism .
Therefore , the bourgeois nations generally have abolished corporal punishment , and the monstrosity of flogging has disappeared in the troops .
When the economic development reached the stage of socialism , with the aggravation of the class struggle , the worker @-@ peasant class , for the purpose of overthrowing the power of the ruling class and eliminating &apos;the exploitation based on such power , must activate the strength of the broad masses of its own class before it can win the victory of the struggle .
The soviet political power is the political power of the most progressive class , and no remnant of the feudal system may exist under it ..
Therefore , in Soviet Russia , corporal punishment is not only no longer in existence in its Red Army , but the use of corporal punishment is strictly prohibited in its laws in general .
The Red 4th Army was created in a China where the feudal system had not been completely eliminated , and its main components mostly came from the troops of the feudal warlords .
The thinking and habits of the feudal system remain strong in the officers and soldiers in general , and therefore , the habit of flogging and the saying of &quot; no fear without flogging &quot; are the same .as in the troops of the feudal warlords .
Though the slogan that the officers must not beat the soldiers and the provision that the soldiers have the right to express their grievances have long been proposed , they are not effective at all , resulting in the alienation between the officers and soldiers , the low morale of the officers as well as the soldiers , the growing number of deserters , the atmosphere of dissatisfaction in the troops , and even incidents of suicide .
This situation is completely contrary to the fighting tasks of the Red Army .
If it is not promptly rectified , the danger is beyond description .
Methods of Rectification
Firmly abolish corporal punishment .
Launch a movement to abolish corporal punishment .
This campaign must aim at both the officers and the soldiers , and spread the meaning that &quot; only the abolition of corporal punishment will benefit the struggle &quot; generally in the officer and soldier masses .
Only then will the officers realize that the abolition of corporal punishment not only will not make it impossible for them to command the troops , but will benefit management and training .
On the part of the soldiers , not only will they not become more intractable , but , because of the abolition of corporal punishment , they will enhance their fighting morale .
With the disappearance of the alienation between the officers and soldiers , they will consciously accept control , training and general discipline .
After corporal punishment is abolished , certain temporary undesirable .
phenomena may appear due to historical reasons .
But the situation will only serve to intensify our responsibilities .
We must vigorously promote the spirit of persuasion and the conscious observance of discipline to overcome the most evil feudal system contrary to the struggle tasks .
We must never use the undesirable phenomena as an excuse to defend the practice of flogging .
All those opposing the abolition of corporal punishment under the excuse of the temporary undesirable phenomena , or slacking off on the movement to abolish corporal punishment , are objectively blocking the development of the revolutionary struggle and thereby helping the ruling class .
The legal procedure to abolish corporal punishment in the Red Army is : a * The penal regulations of the Red Army must be revised , b .
The supreme military and political organs &apos; conference must jointly issue a general order abolishing corporal punishment and promulgate the new penal regulations of the Red Army .
After the general order is issued , the military and political organs must call a meeting of officers to explain in detail the reasons for abolishing corporal punishment , so that they will support the momentous reform embodied in the general order and implement it diligently in the troops , d .
Meanwhile , the soldiers &apos; council must call a meeting of soldier delegates , explaining that , besides supporting the reform , they must hereafter consciously observe discipline and make stringent mass disciplinary sanctions , in order to obtain the desired result of abolishing corporal punishment .
Preferential Treatment of Wounded Soldiers
The Misery of the Wounded and the Sick and Its Influence
The health organs of the various units are unsound .
Medical officers , drugs and stretcher facilities are inadequate , and the personnel are insufficient and not well organized .
Therefore , many wounded and sick soldiers sometimes cannot even obtain basic care let alone full treatment .
The military and political organs of the army do not give sufficient attention to the wounded and the sick .
For instance : a .
In regard to the soundness of the health organs , the authorities have not only failed to make maximum effort , but actually paid no attention to it .
The issue of health is rarely discussed at the various meetings , b .
The officers are not doing all they can to comfort the wounded and the sick .
Such practice as bringing tea to the patients , covering them at night , and visiting them are almost.nonexistent in the Red Army .
The officers take the attitude of indifference , or they even find the patients annoying .
When marching , the officers , and even the soldiers , show no sympathy toward the wounded dropping out of rank , refusing to help them , cursing them or driving them on ruthlessly .
The seriously wounded and sick do not have adequate supplies and allowances .
Wounded soldiers do not have a change of clothes 7 or 8 days after being wounded .
Sick officers receive recuperation allowances , but not the sick soldiers .
The defects of Chiao @-@ yang Hospital are : a .
Being disorganized .
Shortage of medical officers and drugs .
Medical officers selling private medicine , d .
Lack of cleanliness , e .
Inadequate cold weather , clothing and bedding .
Shortage of medical attendants , g .
Inferior food .
Cramped quarters , i .
Bad relationship with the local people .
As a result , the wounded and the sick regard the hospital as a jail and are unwilling to remain in the rear .
The ill treatment of wounded and sick soldiers has produced the following effect : a .
The soldiers become dissatisfied with the Red Army .
&quot; While the Red Army is good , one must not become wounded or sick . &quot; Such opinion is widespread among all soldiers and the lower level officers , b .
The dissatisfaction of the soldiers and the officers further aggravates the alienation between the officers and soldiers , c .
The soldiers and lower level officers are afraid of being wounded .
Therefore , the combat power of the Red Army is reduced , d .
There are many deserters , e .
The worker @-@ peasant masses are less eager to join the Red Army .
Methods of Rectification
The military and political organs must not remain indifferent to the issue of health .
It must be fully discussed at the various meetings .
The organization of the health units must be improved .
Qualified personnel must be assigned to work in such units , instead of packing all those not needed elsewhere into the medical teams .
Moreover , the personnel must be increased , so that the patients will have adequate attention .
The shortages of physicians and drugs must be remedied wherever possible .
In regard to physicians , they must be urged to be more careful in diagnosing , instead of being so indifferent .
Officers , especially company officers in contact with the soldiers , must visit the patients from time to time , bring them tea , and cover them up at night .
If the patients are cold , the officers must find the means to help them , such as borrowing from others , or putting more clothes on them .
Such means of caring for the patients must be made into a system , followed by everyone , because it is the best way to win the masses .
In regard to the wounded dropping out of rank when marching : a .
No one is permitted to revile or ridicule them .
When the wounded or sick are required to yield the way , they must be asked politely , instead of being pushed aside roughly .
Regardless of which unit or organ , whenever a soldier drops out of rank due to injury or illness , be he a combatant or noncombatant , someone must be immediately assigned to look after him .
If the injury or illness is serious , all means must be exhausted to have him carried .
When marching , the rear guard must patiently help the wounded and the sick who are out of rank , and carry their weapons for them when necessary .
Allowances for incidental expenses must be issued to the patients .
Those seriously wounded or ill must receive more than those not seriously wounded or ill .
In regard to those extremely sick or wounded , appropriate recuperation allowances must be issued without distinction of officer or soldier .
In regard to the clothing and bedding of the patients , while the army must do its best to provide them , donations must be solicited among the officers and soldiers of all the units .
It will not only increase the incidental allowances of the patients , but also serve as a good means to stimulate the spirit of mutual help in times of need .
The many defects of the Chiao @-@ yang Rear Hospital must be rectified systematically .
In addition , a campaign for donations ( clothing , bedding , cash , grain ) must be launched among the worker @-@ peasant masses in western Fukien , in order to bring closer the relationship between the worker @-@ peasant masses and the Red Army .
IX .
The Relationship Between the Military and the Political Commands of the Red Army
Before the high level local political organ is organized , the political and military organs of the Red Army , under the leadership of the Front Committee , perform their work in a parallel manner .
The Relationship Between the Red Army and the Masses
In all matters affecting the entire army , such as the promulgation of political programs , the military and political commands will promulgate them jointly .
Before the local political organ is organized , the direction and supervision of mass work , such as propagandizing to the masses , organizing the masses , building political power , down to confiscation , trial , punishment , soliciting donations , , raising funds , and relief , are the functions of the political department .
In all areas where an administrative organ has not yet been set up , the Red Army political department serves in its place , until the time when it is .
In all areas where it has been set up , the principle that the local administrative organ handles all matters independently in order to gain the confidence of the masses must be followed .
Only when the local administrative organ is not yet soundly established , in matters concerning the Red Army and the local area , the method of joint handling by the local administrative organ and the Red Army political department may be resorted to .
Helping the local militia stabilize and develop is the responsibility of the political department ; helping it in peacetime military training and wartime combat direction is the responsibility of Headquarters .
Nevertheless , whenever possible , it should be done through the local administrative organ , and direct handling should be avoided as much as possible .
In regard to the personnel and administration of the Red Army , the military and political commands each has its independent line .
In @-@ matters concerning both , such as mutual transfers of personnel , mutual transmission of information , etc . , they are handled through official communications .
In regard to etiquette and discipline , the military and political commands follow the principle of class subordination .
There must be no disrespect or
insubordination on &apos; ground of different commands .
In regard to supplies , health , marching , combat and encampment , the political command must accept the direction of the military command .
In regard to political training and mass work , the reverse is true .
But such direction can only be issued to the subordinate organs ( general affairs section or the adjutant section ) of the other command .
The direction of matters relating to Red Army fund raising and the decision and disbursement of political work allocations are to be made by the political department , and the military affairs organs may not interfere .
( Funds are drawn directly from the quartermaster &apos;s office by the political department . ) Allocations to the party units are made by the political department . ...
All orders of the military affairs organ , except those which have to be cosigned by the political commissar . , require no endorsement by the political department director .
All orders of the political organs are singly handled by the political department without having to be endorsed by the political commissar .
Editor &apos;s note : This document is one of the earliest and most important records written by Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung on the army and party building of the Chinese Communist Party .
Its standpoint and basic content are completely applicable today .
The many kinds of non @-@ proletarian biases , i.e. , manifestations of warlordist and petty bourgeois biases , pointed in the first part of the resolution are the fundamental problems of the 8th Route Army and New 4th Army today as well as the Red Army at that time .
Our troops exist for the people ; therefore , the three great missions of the Red Army at that time were &quot; fighting , &quot; &quot; raising funds , &quot; and &quot; doing mass work . &quot; This document is extremely forceful on the mass work viewpoint of the Red Army .
Today &apos;s 8th Route Army and New 4th Army still have three great missions , except that &quot; fund raising &quot; has been developed to &quot; production . &quot; The decisions on abolishing corporal punishment ( not beating people ) and the propaganda and education work of the troops in this document deserve our serious attention today .
In general , as our troops are founded on peasants and other petty bourgeois elements and situated in an environment of prolonged dispersed rural guerrilla warfare and in the midst of mercenaries and counterrevolutionary enemies , such counterrevolutionary enemies , traitors and secret service agents , old army offleers , .war prisoners , lumpen proletarians , old peasants , petty bourgeois intellectuals , and the various dogmatist and
sectarianist factors corrode us from the inside as well as the outside .
Therefore , to make our troops truly into the troops completely belonging to the people under the leadership of the proletarian ideology , we must wage a constant anti @-@ bias struggle .
Currently , ours are the best troops in the nation supported by the people .
There has been a great improvement since 1929 .
However , in recent years , certain defects still remain , in the relations between the army and the party and government , between the troops and the people , between the officers and the soldiers , between the lower and higher levels , between military affairs and political work cadres , and among military units .
The main ones among the defects are the warlordist biases of severance from the masses and require the intensive examination and rectification by our military affairs and political work cadres in the rectification movement and the support @-@ government @-@ and @-@ love @-@ people movement .
Meanwhile , -this document starts from the masses and gives considerations to the civilian and soldier masses everywhere .
Therefore , it furnishes us with an effective weapon on this point .
In the political education of our troops , this document was not publicized for many years , and , when it was publicized , it was not used to launch self @-@ criticism , thereby re @-@ committing an error long solved by this document .
This is one loss .
Now , the Central has decided to make this resolution a document for the rectification of the military cadres and a text for the education of the entire army .

&quot; Resolution of the Ninth CCP Congress of the 4th Army of the Red Army , &quot; New Democracy Publishing House ( Hong Kong ) , January 1949
LETTER TO COMRADE LIN PIAO
5 January 1930
&#91; Text &#93; Comrade Lin Piao :
The new year has been here several days , but I have not yet replied to your letter .
First , because I have some business which keeps me busy .
Second , because after all , what could I write to you about ?
What was there that was good which I could offer you ?
I cudgeled my brains , but could not think of anything suitable .
Hence the delay .
Now I have thought of something .
I do not know whether it is appropriate after all to your situation , but this matter of mine is in fact an important question in the present struggle .
Even if it is not appropriate to your individual situation , it is nevertheless an important question .
Hence I bring it up . .
What is the question that I am going to bring up ?
It is a question of appraisal of the current situation and our actions ensuing from it , I used to feel in the past and still feel that your appraisal of the current situation has been relatively pessimistic .
This view of yours was most apparent at the conference in Jui @-@ chin on the evening of IB May last year .
I knew that you believed that a revolutionary upsurge would come inevitably , but you did not believe it possible that it would come soon , so you disapproved of action on .
the plan to seize Kiangsi within a year and favored only guerrilla activities in the three border areas between Fukien , Kwangtung and Kiangsi ; and as you had no profound notion about establishing a Red political power in these three areas , you had no profound notion of promoting a nationwide revolutionary upsurge through intensification and expansion of this Red political power .
Since you believe in the XXX @-@ style policy of mobile guerrilla warfare , you seem to think that , since the revolutionary upsurge is still far away , it will be labor lost to attempt to build up.our political power by hard work .
Instead , you want to extend our political influence by lighter , mobile guerrilla means and , when the masses throughout the country have been won over , or won over to a certain degree , to launch a nationwide uprising which , with the forces of the Red Army thrown in , would become a great , nationwide revolution .
Your theory of first winning over the masses and then establishing political power on a nationwide scale , including all regions , is in my view not suitable to
the Chinese revolution .
According to my observation , this theory of yours stems mainly from your failure to understand clearly that China is a semi @-@ colony contended for by many imperialist powers .
If you clearly understand this , then first , you will understand why in China alone in the world there is such an unusual thing as a prolonged strife within the ruling classes , why the fight intensifies and expands day by day , and why no unified political power has ever come into being .
Second , you will understand how important the peasant problem is , and consequently why rural uprisings have developed on such a nationwide scale as at present .
Third , you will understand the absolute correctness of the slogan of a workers * and peasants &apos; democratic political power .
Fourth , you will understand another unusual thing which corresponds to and arises out of the first that only in China is there a prolonged strife within the ruling classes , and that is the existence and development of the Red Army and guerrilla troops , and , together with them , the existence and development of small Red areas ( Soviet &apos;s ) that have grown amid the encirclement of the White political power ( no such unusual thing is found anywhere except in China ) .
Fifth , you will also understand that the formation and development of the Red Army , the guerrilla units and the soviet areas is the highest form of peasant struggle in a semi @-@ colony , a form which peasant struggle in a serai @-@ colony will inevitably take .
Sixth , you will understand that they ( the Red Army and peasants &apos; Soviets ) undoubtedly are the most important allied forces ( which the proletariat must come forward to lead ) of the struggle of the proletariat in a semi @-@ colony , and that undoubtedly they are an important factor in accelerating the revolutionary upsurge throughout the country .
Seventh , you will understand that the policy of purely mobile guerrilla activities cannot accomplish the task of accelerating the nationwide revolutionary upsurge , while the kind of policy adopted by Chu &#91; TehJ @-@ Mao &#91; Tse @-@ tung &#93; , Ho Lung , Li Wen @-@ lin and Fang Chih @-@ min is undoubtedly correct policy such as establishing base areas , building up political power according to plan , close cooperation between Red Army guerrillas and the broad peasant masses , their organization and training in struggle , deepening of .the agrarian revolution , expanding armed forces by developing first township uprising forces , then district Red Guards , then county Red Guards , then local Red Army units , all the way up to the regular Red Army , and expanding political power by advancing in a series of waves .
Only thus can we win the confidence of the revolutionary masses throughout the country , just as the Soviet Union has done throughout the world .
Only thus can we create tremendous difficulties for the reactionary ruling classes , shake their very foundations and precipitate their internal disintegration .
And only thus can we really create a Red Army that will be one of our important instruments in the coming great revolution .
In short , only thus can we accelerate the revolutionary upsurge .
I wish to speak once &apos;more now about the reason why you make a relatively
pessimisticto my way of thinkingappraisal of the current situation .
Your appraisal , I think , is exactly the opposite of that made by a group
in the party who suffer from revolutionary impetuosity .
Comrades who suffer
from this malady unduly overestimate the subjective forces of the revolution
and underestimate the objective forces .
Such an appraisal stems largely from
subjectivism .
In the end , it will undoubtedly lead to the path of adventurism .
You have not made such a mistake .
But you seem to have a .fault in .
another respect , and that is , you underestimate somewhat the subjective forces and overestimate somewhat the objective forces .
This is also an inappropriate appraisal and will inevitably produce another kind of bad result .
You admit the weakness of the subjective forces and the strength of the objective forces , but you do not seem to understand the following important features : &apos;
Although the subjective forces of the revolution in China are weak , so are all organs ( government , armed forces , parties , organizations , etc . ) of .the ruling classes with their foothold on the backward and fragile social and economic structure of China .
This explains why revolution cannot break out at present in the countries of Western Europe where , although the subjective forces of revolution are much stronger than those in China , the forces of the ruling classes there are also many times stronger than those in our country .
The subjective forces of the revolution in China are weak , but because the objective forces are also weak , the revolution will certainly move toward an upsurge more quickly in China than in Western Europe .
Since the defeat of the Great Revolution , the subjective forces of revolution have indeed been greatly weakened .
The force that remains is to all appearances very small and this naturally makes some comrades ( who judge by appearances ) feel pessimistic .
But it is a quite different thing if we look into the essence of the matter .
Here the old Chinese proverb , &quot; A .single spark can start a prairie fire , &quot; is applicable .
In other words , although the force is only a small one at present , it will rapidly develop .
.In China , as things stand , its development is not merely a possibility but a necessity .
This was fully proved in the 30 May Movement and the Great Revolutionary Movement which followed .
In studying an event , we must examine its essence and treat its appearance merely as a guide to the threshold of the essence .
Once we have crossed the threshold , we must grasp the essence and put aside the appearance that serves as the guide .
.This alone is the reliable and scientific method of analysis which has revolutionary significance .
Similarly , in estimating the objective forces , we must never look merely at their appearance , but must study their essence .
In the early period of our independent regime on the Hunan @-@ Kiangsi border , a small number of comrades seriously believed in the incorrect appraisal made by the Hunan Provincial Party Committee of that time and regarded our class enemy as not worth a rap .
The two phrases , &quot; extremely.shaky &quot; and &quot; exceedingly panicky , &quot; which have been passed on as standing jokes even to this day , were precisely the description used at that time ( from May to June 1928 ) by the Hunan Provincial Party Committee in sizing up Lu @-@ Ti @-@ p &apos;ing , the ruler of Hunan ..
Political adventurism necessarily ensued from such an appraisal , But during the approximately 4 months from November 1928 to February 1929 ( before the war between Chiang Kai @-@ shek and the Kwangsi warlords broke out ) , when the largest third joint expedition pressed forward to Ching @-@ kang Mountains , a section of comrades raised the question , &quot; How long can the Red flag be kept flying ? &quot; As a matter of fact , the struggle in China between Britain , , the United States and Japan had by then become quite open , and the situation was taking shape for a fight between Chiang Kai @-@ shek , Feng Yu @-@ hsiang and the Kwangsi warlords .
In reality it was just the time when the counterrevolutionary tide began to ebb and the revolutionary tide to rise again .
But during this very period not only was a pessimistic view found in the Red Army and local party organizations , but the party center was more or less perplexed by surface conditions and became pessimistic in its tone .
The February letter from the Central Committee furnished proof of the pessimism shown by the party in its analysis at that time .
The present objective situation may still easily perplex those comrades who observe only the appearance of the existing conditions but not their essence .
Those of us working in the Red Army , especially when defeated in battle , encircled on all sides or pursued by strong enemy forces , often unwittingly universalize and magnify what after all are only momentary , particular and local conditions , as if the whole situation in China and throughout the world was dark and gloomy , and the prospect of victory of the revolution dim and remote .
They neglect the essence in making such an observation because they have not made a scientific analysis of the general situation .
If it is asked whether the revolutionary upsurge will arise soon in China , we can give a definite answer only after studying carefully whether the contradictions leading to the revolutionary upsurge are really developing .
Since contradictions are developing internationally between the imperialist countries , between the imperialist countries and their colonies , and between imperialism and the proletariat in these countries , the imperialists feel all the more urgently the need to contend for China .
As the imperialists &apos; contention for China intensifies , both the contradiction between the imperialist powers and the whole Chinese nation and the contradiction among the imperialists themselves develop simultaneously in China , a daily expanding and intensifying strife thus ensues between the various cliques of rulers in China and the contradictions between them develop daily .
From these contradictions between the various cliques of rulersthe strife between the warlordsensues an increase of taxation ; thus the development of the contradiction between the broad masses of taxpayers and the rulers is accelerated with every passing day .
From the contradiction between imperialism and Chinese capitalism , that is , the failure of the Chinese bourgeoisie to obtain concessions from imperialism , ensues an immediate intensification of the contradiction between China &apos;s bourgeoisie and the Chinese working class : the Chinese bourgeoisie must now intensify their exploitation of the working class .
From the imperialist commodity aggression , the inroads made by Chinese merchant capital , and increase of taxation by the governmentall of which are contradictory to the interests of the landlord class , ensues the sharpening of the contradiction between the landlords and the peasants , that is , exploitation by landlords in the form of rent and usury becomes heavier .
Because of the pressure of foreign goods , the exhaustion of the purchasing power of the broad masses of workers and peasants , and increase of taxation by the government , dealers in domestic products and independent small producers are forced daily further on the road to bankruptcy .
Because of the unrestricted expansion of &#91; government &#93; troops without sufficient provisions and funds to support them and the steady spread of war , the masses of soldiers constantly find themselves suffering from cold , hunger , exhaustion and
casualties .
Because of the increase of taxation by the government , the mounting burden of rent and interest demanded by landlords , and the daily extension of the horrors of war , which leads to widespread famine and banditry throughout the country , the broad masses of peasants and the urban poor are brought to such a pass that they can hardly survive .
Because funds are lacking for keeping schools open , many students are worried that , they may not be able to continue their education .
Because of the backwardness of production , graduates have little hope of obtaining employment .
Once we understand all these contradictions , we shall see how desperately precarious the situation is , and how chaotic the state in which China finds herself .
We shall also see how inevitably and soon the revolutionary upsurge against the imperialists , the warlords and the landlords will arise .
China is littered all over with dry firewood which will -soon be kindled and become a conflagration .
The proverb , &quot; A single spark can start a prairie fire , &quot; appropriately describes how the current situation will develop .
We need only look at the nationwide development of.workers &apos; strikes , peasant uprisings , soldiers &apos; mutinies , and strikes by merchants and students to see that it is no longer merely &quot; sparks &quot; but will undoubtedly not take long for these &quot; sparks &quot; to become &quot; a prairie fire . &quot; ,
The gist of what is said above was given in a letter from the Front Committee to the Central Committee , dated 5 April 1929 .
It reads in part :
key districts are the important organizational tasks of the party at present .
But at the same time the development of struggles in the countryside , the establishment of Red political power in small areas , and creation and expansion of the Red Army are also main conditions for helping the struggle in the cities and accelerating the revolutionary upsurge .
Therefore , it is the biggest mistake to abandon the struggle in cities and be immersed in guerrilla activities in rural areas .
But in our opinion it is also a mistake for any of our party members to fear the development of the power of the peasants lest it become stronger than that of the workers and hence detrimental to the revolution .
For the revolution in semi @-@ colonial China will fail only if the peasant struggle is deprived of the leadership of the workers , and it will never suffer just because the peasants &gt; through their struggle , become more powerful than the workers . &quot;
The letter also contains the following reply to the question of the Red Army &apos;s line of action :
&quot; To preserve the Red Army and arouse the masses , the Central Committee wants us to divide up our forces into very small units and disperse them widely over the countryside , and that Chu Teh and Mao Tse @-@ tung leave the ranks so that the major targets will be hidden from the enemy .
This is an idealistic way of thinking .
To divide up our forces into company or battalion @-@ size units , each operating on its own ; to disperse them widely over the countryside ; to arouse the masses through guerrilla activities ; and to avoid becoming the enemy &apos;s targetall these we planned and tried on numerous occasions ever since the winter of 1927 , but they all proved failures .
The reasons are :
( 1 ) Most of the soldiers in the main force of the Red Army catne from the outside and are different from the local Red guardsmen in their origin *
( 2 ) With small dispersed units , the leadership will become so weak as to be unable to cope with adverse circumstances , hence we shall be liable to suffer defeat .
( 3 ) Small units are easy for the enemy to crush separately , ( A ) The more adverse the circumstances , the greater becomes the need for the forces to be concentrated and for the leadership to conduct , resolute struggle , for only thus @-@ can we achieve internal unity against the enemy .
Only in favorable .
circumstances can the forces be divided for guerrilla operations , and it is only then that the leaders need not stay with the ranks all the time , as they must do in adverse circumstances , . , &quot;
The defect of this passage is that the reasons given against the division of forces are of a negative character , and that is far from adequate .
The positive reason for concentrating our forces is this : only concentration will enable us to wipe out comparatively large enemy units and occupy cities .
Only after wiping out comparatively large enemy units and occupying cities can we arouse the masses on a large scale and build up a unified political power over a number of adjoining counties .
Only thus can we arouse the attention of the people far and near ( i.e. , &quot; expanding our political influence &quot; ) , and make a material contribution toward accelerating the revolutionary upsurge .
For instance , both the regime we created on the Hunan @-@ rKiangsI border in the year before last and that created in western Fukien last year were the result
of our policy of concentrating the troops .
This is the general principle .
Are there , however , not times when the forces should be divided up ?
Yes , there are .
The letter to the Central Committee from the Front Committee speaks of the Red Army &apos;s guerrilla tactics , including the division of forces within a short radius :
&quot; The tactics we have worked out during the last 3 years in the course of the struggle are indeed different from any employed in ancient or modern times , in China or elsewhere .
With our tactics , the struggles of the masses are daily expanding and no enemy , however powerful , can cope with us .
Ours are guerrilla tactics .
They consist mainly of the following points : &quot; Disperse the forces to arouse the masses and concentrate the forces to deal with the enemy . &quot; &quot; The enemy advances , we retreat ; the enemy halts , we harass ; the enemy tires , we attack ; the enemy retreats , we pursue . &quot; &quot; In an independent regime with stabilized territory , we adopt the policy of advancing in a series of waves .
When pursued by a powerful enemy , we adopt the policy of circling around in a whirling motion . &quot; &quot; Arouse the largest number of the masses in the shortest possible time and by the best possible method . &quot; These tactics are just like casting a net .
We should be able to cast the net wide or draw it in at any moment .
We cast it wide to win over the masses and draw it in to deal with the enemy .
Such are the tactics we have applied in the past 3 years . &quot;
Here , &quot; to cast the net wide &quot; means to divide up our forces for a short term .
For example , when we first captured the county town of Yung @-@ lisin on the Hunan @-@ Kiangsi border , we divided up the 29th and 31st Regiments within the boundaries of Yung @-@ hsin .
Again , when we captured for the third time the county town of Yung @-@ hsin , we divided our forces by dispatching the 28th Regiment to the border of An @-@ fu , the 29th to Llen @-@ hua and the 3lst to the border of Chi @-@ an County .
And again , in April and May last year our troops were divided up in the counties of southern Kiangsi , and in July they were divided up in the counties of western Fukien .
All these were appropriate examples .
As to the dispersion of forces over a wide area , this is possible only under two conditions : .when circumstances are comparatively favorable and when the leading body is comparatively sound .
For the aim of dividing up our forces is to render ourselves more capable of winning over the masses , of deepening the agrarian revolution and establishing political power , and of expanding the Red Army and the local armed forces .
It is better not to divide up the forces if it is impossible to attain these aims , or if division of forces could only lead to defeat and a weakening of the Red Army , as in August of the year before last when our forces were divided up on the Hunan @-@ KIangsi border for an attack on ChTen ~ chou .
If the two above @-@ mentioned conditions are present , we should undoubtedly divide up the forces , because then division will be more advantageous than concentration .
As for the division of forces under emergency circumstances to preserve our strength and avoid concentration of target for the enemy , I am opposed to that in principle .
This is made clear in the letter from the Front Committee to the Central Committee quoted above .
In addition , will there be a time when work should be done by dividing the forces because economic conditions do not permit concentration ?
That is possible , but I cannot make a positive conclusion , because we have not yet had concrete experience in this respect .
The February letter from the Central Committee was not written in the right spirit , and has exerted a bad influence on a number of comrades in the party in the 4th Army .
Even you seemed to have been affected too * The Central Committee also issued at that time a circular stating that war between Chiang Kai @-@ shek and the Kwangsi warlords might not break out .
Since then , however , its appraisals and directives have in the main been correct .
It has already issued another circular to correct the one containing the inadequate appraisal ( as in fact it was only part of a larger circular ) .
Although it did not make any formal correction as to the letter to the Red Army , its subsequent directives were entirely not tainted with such pessimism and its views on the Red ArmyTs movements now completely agree with ours .
Yet that letter remains a bad influence on a number of comrades .
The Front Committee &apos;s reply to the letter of the Central Committee was made public within the party together with the Central Committee &apos;s letter , but it does not seem to have had a considerable influence on this section of comrades , because the letter from the Central Committee exactly suited their convictions .
Meanwhile , many subsequent correct directives from the Central Committee on its appraisal of the current situation might not have been heeded by this section of comrades , or even if they have heeded them , they are still unable to erase completely the former impression given them .
Thus I feel that even now it is still necessary to give some explanation on the question .
The plan to seize Kiangsi within a year was also proposed by the Front Committee to the Central Committee in April last year , and a resolution was subsequently passed at Yu @-@ tu .
1 record as follows the reason given then in the letter to the Central Committee :
&quot; The troops of Chaing Kai @-@ shek and the Kwangsi warlords are drawing near each other in the environs of Chiu @-@ chiang , and big battles will take place presently .
The Kuomintang rule will consequently disintegrate and the revolutionary upsurge will arrive soon .
In preparing our work in these circumstances , we feel that , so far as the southern provinces are concerned , the military forces of the compradors and landlords in Kwangtung and Hunan are too strong , while in Hunan , because of the party &apos;s putschist mistake , we have moreover lost almost all our mass following outside as well as inside the party .
In the three provinces of Fukien , Kiangsi and Chekiang , however , the situation is different .
First , the enemy &apos;s military strength there is at its feeblest .
In Chekiang , there are only a small number of provincial guards under Chiang Po @-@ ch &apos;eng .
In Fukien , though there are altogether 14 regiments under 5 commands , Kuo Feng @-@ ming &apos;s brigade has already been smashed ; the troops under the respective command of Ch &apos;en Kuo @-@ hui and Lu Hsing @-@ parig are bandit forces of small fighting capacity ; the two brigades of marines stationed along the coast have never seen action and certainly cannot have great fighting capacity ; Chang Chen alone is comparatively able to fight ; but even he , according to an analysis made by the Provincial Committee of Fukien , has under his command only two regiments of some fighting capacity .
In addition , Fukien is now entirely in a state of confusion and disunity .
In Kiangsi there are altogether 16 regiments under two commandsthat of Chu P &apos;ei @-@ te and that of Hsiung Shih @-@ hui ; the military strength there is
superior to that of either Fukien or Chekinng , but still far inferior to that of Hunan .
Secondly , we have committed fewor putschist mistakes in these three provinces .
With the exception of Chekiang , where the situation is not quite clear to us , the party &apos;s organizations and mass following in both Kiangsi and Fukien are better than those in Hunan .
Take Kiangsi for instance .
There we still retain a fairly adequate basis in Te @-@ an , Hsiu @-@ shui and T &apos;ung @-@ ku in northern Kiangsi .
In Ning @-@ kang , Yung @-@ hsin , Lien @-@ nua atid Sui @-@ chfuan in western Kiangsi the party and the Red Guards are still powerful .
In southern Kiangsi the situation is even more hopeful , as the 2d and 4th Regiments of the Red Army tend to grow every day in counties like Chi @-@ an , Yung @-@ hsin and Hsing @-@ kuo , and the Red Army under Fang Chih @-@ niin is by no means wiped out .
All this places us in a position to close in on Nan @-@ chang .
We propose to the Central Committee that during the period of prolonged warfare between the Kuomintang warlords , we contend with both Chiahg Kai @-@ shek and the Kwangsi clique for Kiangsi and at the same time for the western parts of both Fukien and Chekiang , In these three provinces the Red Army should be expanded and an independent regime of the masses created .
We set the time @-@ limit at 1 year for accomplishing this plan .
Within this year proletarian bases for struggle should be established in such places as Shanghai , Wusih , Ningpo , Hangchow , Foochow and Amoy , in order to provide leadership to the peasant struggles in the provinces of Chekiang , Kiangsi and Fukien .
The Provincial Committee of Kiangsi must be made healthy and strong .
An effort must be made to build workersT bases of Nan @-@ chang , Chiu @-@ chiang , Chi @-@ an and the Nan @-@ chang @-@ Chiu @-@ chiang Railway . &quot;
The above proposal to seize Kiangsi in 1 year erred in setting the time @-@ limit mechanically at 1 year .
The proposal to seize Kiangsi was based , in my opinion , on the consideration that the nationwide revolutionary upsurge would arise soon , apart from the conditions in the province itself .
For if we had not been convinced of this , we could not possibly have arrived at the conclusion about the seizure of Kiangsi in a year .
The only defect in the proposal was setting the time @-@ limit mechanically at 1 year , thereby affecting the meaning of the word &quot; soon &quot; in the statement that &quot; a revolutionary upsurge will arise soon &quot; and making it smack more or less of mechanicism and impetuosity .
But you do not believe in the seizure of Kiangsi in a year , because you overestimate the objective forces and underestimate the subjective forces , Consequently , you do not believe in the arrival of the revolutionary upsurge soon , and hence your conclusion .
As to the subjective and objective conditions in Kiangsi , they will deserve our attention .
Apart from the subjective conditions as stated above to which I have no new opinion to add , three things concerning the objective conditions can now be clearly pointed out : First , the economy in Kiangsi is chiefly an economy of feudal vestiges , i.e. , one of exploitation through land rent ; the power of the merchant bourgeoisie is relatively weak ; and the armed forces of the landlords are stronger than those in any other southern province .
Second , Kiangsi has no troops of its own .
It has always been garrisoned by troops from other provinces .
Sent there for the &quot; annihilation of Communists &quot; or &quot; annihilation of bandits / &apos; these troops are not very enthusiastic because they are unfamiliar with local conditions and do not feel such personal concern as native troops do .
And third , Kiangsi , unlike Kwangtung which is close to Hong Kong where almost all things are under British control , is comparatively free from the influence of imperialism .
Once we have grasped these three points . , we can explain why rural uprisings have been more widespread and the Red Army and guerrilla units more numerous in Kiangsi than in any other province .
I have now said roughly all I want to say to you , I have perhaps said too much , like a chatterbox .
But I think our discussion of the question is good .
If this question which we are discussing is really correctly settled , the influence on the action of the Red Army will be great .
So I have written this with great pleasure .
Lastly there are still two points which need making clear .
First , how to interpret the two words &quot; arise soon &quot; in the phrase tra revolutionary upsurge will arise soon &quot; is a common question among many comrades .
Marxists are not fortune @-@ tellers .
Of future developments and changes he should and can only point the general direction ; he should not and cannot mechanically fix the day and the hour .
My statement that the revolutionary upsurge in China will arise soon emphatically does not refer to something utterly devoid of significance for action , to a tantalizing phantom , which , in the words of some people , &quot; may arise . &quot; It is like a ship on the sea whose masthead is already seen in the horizon by people standing on the shore .
It is like the morning sun which , rising with radiant beams in the east , is already seen from afar by people standing on the top of a mountain .
It is like an almost fully formed child stirring in its mother &apos;s womb .
Second , when I say you want to extend our political influence by lighter , mobile guerrilla means , I do not mean that you have a purely military viewpoint and the mentality of a roving bandit .
Obviously , you have neither , because neither has any idea of winning over the masses , while you advocate &quot; winning over the masses without reservation . &quot; You not only advocate it , but are actually doing it .
What I do not approve is your lack of a profound notion about establishing a &#91; Red &#93; political power , as a result of which the task of winning over the masses to accelerate the coming of the revolutionary upsurge will certainly not be satisfactorily accomplished as you wish .
The principal purpose of ray letter is to make clear this point .
Please correct me where I am wrong .

QUESTION OF RICH PEASANTS AFTER LAND DISTRIBUTION ( Situation at Yung @-@ hsin and in the Northern Party )
October 1930
&#91; Text &#93; Exploitation by the rich peasants of the Red area of Yung @-@ hsin is done by ( 1 ) hoarding of grain to raise its price and ( 2 ) selling of industrial products .
Hoarding of grain is in turn done by two methods : one , hoarding of their own surplus grain and two , buying o grain from poor peasants at very low prices , causing this year &apos;s serious spring famine .
Because they wanted to hoard grain and raise its price , and as the maximum price of grain was set by the government , the rich peasants concealed all their grain , so that poor people and workers in the town had to subsist on thin gruel for a whole week .
Even farm hands and poor peasants in rural villages , unable to buy grain , had to fight with starvation .
Later , the county soviet led a spring famine struggle , waging a resolute fight against the rich peasants without making any concession , in a determined bid to hold down grain prices .
The party acted in all districts and villages , leading Young Pioneers in throwing open storerooms and uncovering large amounts of grain concealed by the rich peasants in wine barrels , double walls , barns and under brick @-@ covered yards and beds .
As a result , there was enough grain for all and to spare .
And when new grain was harvested , the rich peasants all brought their old grain to the town to sell .
In selling industrial goods and doing small business the rich peasants make extraordinarily large profit .
They deal mainly in salt , imported stockings , handkerchiefs , sugar and soap .
They have money and various old social connections .
They can buy in quantity what the poor peasants and farm hands cannot buy .
( The above is reported by Wang Huai &#91; 3769 / 2037 &#93; ; the following is by Ch &apos;en Cheng @-@ jen &#91; 7115 / 2973 / 0086 &#93; )
The situation prevails not only in Yung @-@ hsin , but also ifl the northern parts , where a spring famine struggle was also waged this year .
There the rich peasants do business and make money like their counterparts in Yung @-@ hsin .
There is Chiu Ju @-@ t &apos;ang in Fu @-@ t &apos;ien which is smalltime capitalist .
When there is a shortage of salt in the north , it goes to buy salt in Nan @-@ chang , When supplies of printing ink and paper run short , it also buys them from Nan @-@ chang .
Consequently , it has friendly contacts with the leader of the Kuomintang lookout squads as well as old social connections .
Chiu Ju @-@ t &apos;ang
sells salt and other goods at a very high price .
In June @-@ July it sold salt at 1 string and 600 coppers a catty .
It owns two sewing machines and is opposed by all tailors and dressmakers of Fu @-@ t &apos; ien . , as it takes away work from them .
Because it sold goods at too high prices , the Fu @-@ t &apos;ien town soviet , acting on demands by the masses , had the proprietor of Chiu Ju @-@ t &apos;ang arrested and fined him 1,000 yuan .
After the fine , he continued to do business in Fu @-@ t &apos;ien .
After the capture of Chi @-@ an , his business has grown even more .
During the spring famine in the north , the rich peasants sold their grain in White areas .
The spring famine struggle was to stop grain from flowing to White areas , permitting such flow only between Red areas .
INVESTIGATION IK TUNG @-@ T &apos;ANG AND OTHER AREAS 8 November 1930
&#91; Text &#93; On 30 October 1930 , the Red Army Front Committee decided at Lo @-@ fang on a policy of luring the enemy deep into our territory .
On 6 November the Red Army moved from Hsia @-@ chiang , crossed Kan @-@ chiang and marched toward Yung @-@ feng and Nan @-@ ch &apos;eng , while I went from Hsia @-@ chiang to Chi @-@ an to make arrangements for a withdrawal .
On 7 November I passed the night at Tung @-@ t &apos;ang , arriving at Chi @-@ an the following day .
On the way I made some summary investigations .
My investigations at Li @-@ chia @-@ fang have enabled me to know clearly the organization and activities of village and township level Soviets in the agrarian struggle in these places .
Prior to these investigations , my .Ideas of the situation were vague .
These investigations have , enabled me to find out the serious character of land distribution based on each village as a unit .
Land is already distributed in several dozen counties in southwestern Kiangsi .
The land law promulgated by the superior level government makes the distribution based on each township as a unit , and all personnel of superior @-@ level organs presume that distribution is made with each township as a unit .
The actual situation is quite different .
Distribution is generally made with each village as a unit .
Only in a few instances has it been made with each township as a unit .
Such distribution based on each villageadvantageous to the rich peasants but disadvantageous to poor peasantsshould be changed .
Investigations in Tung @-@ t &apos;ang
Tung @-@ t &apos;ang village of the 15th township , T &apos;ung @-@ shui Ch &apos;u , Chi @-@ shui County .
The township consists of 1,000 families of 3,000 persons .
Land is distributed with each village as a unit .
The population of this village is 290 .
The village government has a chairman and a secretary , both of whom provide their own food .
Land distribution is made at 1 tou 3 sheng per capita , yielding about 2.5 tan of grain .
( 1 tou of land yields 2 tan of grain . )
In some , other villages the distribution is 1.5 tou per capita or 2 tou , which is the maximum .
Distribution never exceeds 2 tou in this township ,
Hu Te @-@ shun , 48 , is secretary of the village government and concurrently a teacher at the Common People &apos;s School .
Eight persons eat in his house : he himself , his five children , his wife , and the wife of his eldest son .
The eldest son , 25 , is a tailor but also tills the land .
The second son , 19 , is learning to be a carpenter .
He has gone to Yung @-@ feng County to serve as an apprentice and has no money to send home .
The third son , 14 , is learning to do wickerwork .
He too , being still an apprentice , has no money to send home .
The fourth son , 7 , goes to school .
The fifth son is only 3 years old .
The family had 1 shih 3 tou and 8 sheng of land in the past , yielding 27 tan of grain a year .
When there was not enough grain to eat , the family lived on sweet potatoes and kept pigs for sale .
The eldest son already earned some money and tilled the land besides .
They owed a debt of 300 strings of copper cash .
The eight @-@ member family receives a total of 1 shih and 4 sheng of land as a result of the recent land distribution , but the land is divided and 3 tou and 4 sheng is taken out of it .
For 70 or 80 li round from Chi @-@ antown to Chin @-@ t &apos;an , T &apos;ung @-@ shui and Fu @-@ tTien , almost all female members of families weave cloth .
The output is considerable .
Yarn ( foreign yarn ) is provided the peasant families by merchants , rich peasants and landlords .
The process of capitalists undermining household side @-@ occupation has not yet ended .
Investigations in Ta @-@ ch &apos;iao
This belongs to the 9th township of ChintTan Ch &apos;u , Chi @-@ shui County .
It is
50 li from Chi @-@ an ,
The Ch &apos;u is divided into 13 townships .
This township is divided into 5 villages .
This village is Tach &apos;iao Village .
Chairman of the township government is Sun Hsiu @-@ en .
The population of Liu @-@ chia of Kao @-@ k &apos;eng is 570 .
Distribution of land is 9 lo or 4.5 shih per capita .
The population of TTang @-@ chia of Kao @-@ k &apos;eng is 110 , with each person also receiving 9 lo .
Each of the 50 persons of Wu @-@ chia of Kao @-@ k &apos;eng also receives 9 lo .
The three villages of Liu , T &apos;ang and Wu have one government in common .
The distribution is 9 lo per capita in all three villages .
The Kuo clan of Ta @-@ ch &apos;iao village , with 1,027 persons , receives 8 lo per capita , or 2 tou of land , yielding 4 tan of grain .
The Lo clan of Shen @-@ chiang Market , with a population of 210 in two villages under one government , receives 8 lo per capita .
The two villages of Kuo and Lo receive 8 lo per capita , because the land here is better .
The distribution in the three villages of Liu , T &apos;ang and Wu is 9 lo per capita , because the land here is poorer .
The average per capita consumption of grain is 10 lo ( 5 tan ) a year .
Late crop rice can be grown on one--third of the land of each village .
This cannot be done in the remaining two @-@ thirds of the land because of lack of water .
The two kinds of land , that which can grow late crop rice and that which cannot , are mixed in distribution , so that each person receives some of each kind .
The 8 or 9 lo refers to the combined yield of early and late crops .
As the per capita consumption is 10 lo a year , he who receives 8 lo is 2 lo short and he who receives 9 lo is 1 lo short .
The shortage is made good in two ways : One is working at the crafts , such as cloth dyeing , rice processing , carpentry , blacksmithing , tailoring , etc .
Over 300 persons have gone to other places to work .
Of these , 170 or 180 have gone to Kanchow , mainly as millers , tailors and small merchants .
About 100 persons have gone to Chi @-@ an , mainly to work at rice milling and cloth dyeing .
All these persons receive their share of land at home .
The township does not produce coarse grain .
Two are weaving cloth .
The female members of every family weave cloth .
Each &quot; piece &quot; of cloth is over 12 chang or 130 ch &apos;ih long and is worth 400 copper cash in wages , A worker who is fast takes 10 days to weave one piece and will get 1,200 copper cash a month in wages .
A worker who is not fast , or who has to look after small children besides , will not be able to finish one piece in 10 days .
The rich peasants and small @-@ time merchants bring foreign yarn from Chi @-@ an and allot it to the villagers and families .
Those whose work is not satisfactory are paid 300 coppers a piece or even as little as 200 .
Some even have to pay for the yarn spoiled .
In addition to the cash payment , a worker receives also 2 taels of yarn for every piece of cloth woven .
The yarn , is enough for 2 ch &apos;ih of cloth , and each ch &apos;ih is worth 100 to 110 coppers .
It is this extra payment in yarn that provides the peasants with clothing .
The 120 @-@ copper a month is enough for cooking oil and salt .
Working at crafts and weaving cloth together constitute the main source of income that makes up for the grain shortage .
At present there is not much work to do either in weaving or the crafts .
The workers who have gone to Kanchow have not yet returned .
Of the 100 men who went to Chi @-@ an , 50 or 60 have come back .
This township has not yet set up a school .
A recent order from this Ch &apos;u will have 20 volunteers for the Red Army from each township .
Eighteen have responded , all voluntarily .
A rally was held today at Wu @-@ kang Ch &apos;u Government to send them off .
Investigations in Li @-@ chia @-@ fang
Li @-@ chia @-@ fang is the 19th township , Ju @-@ fang Ch &apos;u , Chi @-@ an .
( About 40 li from
Chi @-@ an )
This township has nine villages under six village @-@ level governments .
Of the nine villages , six are large and three small .
The six large villages are Li @-@ chia @-@ fang , Shang @-@ chao @-@ tfang , Ts &apos;ang @-@ hsia , Hsu @-@ yuan , Chin @-@ pi and Chou @-@ yuan .
The three small ones are Yen @-@ chia @-@ fang , Hsiao @-@ li @-@ chia @-@ fang and Yang @-@ p &apos;ing @-@ chou , The three small vil &#93; ages and Li @-@ chia @-@ fang are under one government , while each of the remaining five large villages has its own government .
The village government of Li @-@ chia @-@ fang is run by four persons : one chairman , one secretary , one officer in charge of land and grain , and one in charge of communications and concurrently cooking .
The chairman , secretary and communications officer who is concurrently the cook live and work in the government building and eat at public expense .
The officer in charge of land and grain administration lives in his own home and eats his own meals .
He is provided with meals only when he works at the government office .
The village government &apos;s expenses are : ( 1 ) Regular meals for three plus meals for an average of two persons a day .
At 10 cents per person each day , it comes to 15 yuan a month .
( 2 ) Office expenses for lamps , oil , paper and pens , 3 yuan .
( 3 ) Every time Red Guards and Young Pioneers are sent out on a mission they are paid expenses for straw sandals , haircut , cigarettes .
Sometimes they are paid 500 and other times 1 string of coppers ( Actual expenses are defrayed ; overpayment is returned , underpayment is made up for . ) In the nine attacks on Chi @-@ an , they sometimes went on a mission for a month before returning .
These pocket expenses amounted to 3 yuan a month on the average in the past .
In the past , the village government had also to pay for their food .
Later , the township government paid for their food and the village government gave them pocket expenses .
These three items amounted to a total of 21 yuan .
In the past nine persons worked for the village government .
There were the chairman , secretary , finance officer , procurement officer , land officer , grain officer , judge , communications officer and the cook .
All nine worked in the government office and were provided with board .
The revolutionary force was in control from early in the 1st month this year to the 19th of the third month , and again from the fourth day of the sixth month to the fourth day of the ninth month .
In the period from the 20th of the third month to the third of the sixth month when the reactionary force was in control , the village government was abolished and the responsible persons fled to Fu @-@ t &apos;ien .
From the fifth day of the ninth month up to the present , only four persons work regularly in the government .
More money was required when nine persons worked in the office .
In the period from the tenth of the first month to the 19th of the third month , and again from the fourth of the sixth month to the fifth of the ninth month , the township government comprised the chairman , a secretary , buyer , treasurer , cultural officer , lang officer , grain officer , judge , communications officer , a cook , three women officers , three Young Pioneers ( the leader , the deputy leader and an instructor and concurrently secretary ) , and one leader of the Children &apos;s Corps , a total of 18 &#91; sic &#93; persons .
They were all provided with board by the government .
From the sixth of the ninth month up to the present
the number of officers has been reduced Co seven : the chairman , a secretary , an officer in charge of land and grain , a cultural officer , the chairman of the Woman &apos;s Committee , the leader of the Red Guards who doubles for the cook , and another secretary who is the &quot; Confiscations Commissar &quot; and concurrently the officer who &quot; goes to the villages to do propaganda on the expansion of the Red Army , &quot; These seven persons regularly live and have their meals in the government offices .
The four members of the Woman &apos;s Committee eat their meals at the government office when they have official work to do , otherwise they stay at home .
The work of these four women members consists of going to the villages to organize working women to serve as Red Guards , comforting squads and washing squads , and doing propaganda to get the men to serve in the Red Army .
In the second month this year eight men from this township went to join the Red Army .
During the second attack on Chi @-@ an on the 18th of the sixth month , two men from each village or a total of 18 , went to join the Red Army .
During the seventh attack on Chi @-@ an in the seventh month , another seven men went .
After the ninth attack on Chi @-@ an on the 13th of the eighth month , another 46 men went .
These have been placed in the Independent Regiments and are receiving training at the command post of the 2d Independent Regiment at Ta @-@ t &apos;acig .
Altogether 80 persons from this township have gone to join the Red Army .
They all did so after being agitated .
But of the last batch of 46 , A or 5 were unwilling to join up and wept .
They went reluctantly .
This township comprises nine villages : Li @-@ chia @-@ fang ( of the surname of Hu , over 220 persons ) , Hsiao @-@ li @-@ chia @-@ fang ( surname of Li , 30 persons ) , Yeh @-@ chia @-@ fang ( surname of Yeh , 45 persons ) and Yang @-@ p1ing @-@ chou ( surname of Tung , 24 persons ) ; these four villages have a population of 327 ( 155 male and 172 female ) .
Shang @-@ chao @-@ t &apos;ang , ( surname of Liu , 200 persons ) ; Ts &apos;ang @-@ hsia , surname of Yen , 315 persons ( 150 male and 165 female ) ; Hsu @-@ yuan , surname of Chou , 300 persons ; Chin @-@ pi , 190 persons ; and Chou @-@ yuan , 372 persons ( 176 male and 196 female ) .
The nine villages have a total population of 1,404 .
The four villages headed by Li @-@ chia @-@ fang have altogether 921.1 mou of fields .
In Li @-@ chia @-@ fang each person receives 2.7 mou , yielding 7 tan of grain .
In Yeh @-@ chia @-@ fang each person receives 3 mou , yielding 6 tan of grain .
In Hsiao @-@ li @-@ chia @-@ fang each person receives 2 mou , yielding 5.5 tan of grain .
In Yang @-@ pTing @-@ chou each person receives 2.5 mou , yielding 5.5 tan of grain .
Of the remaining 17.9 mou of Li @-@ chia @-@ fang , 6 mou has been transferred to Hsiao @-@ li @-@ chia @-@ fang and another 6 to Yeh @-@ chia @-@ fang .
Only 5,9 mou remains &quot; communal property . &quot; After distribution in Yang @-@ p &apos;ing @-@ chou , 2.3 mou remains &quot; coimnunal property . &quot; This remainder after distribution is difficult to divide up again .
So it is public land of the village government , which rents it out at a rate of 60 percent of the yield .
This rent in kind helps to defray public expenses .
Shang @-@ chao @-@ tTang Village has 820 mou of fields .
Each person receives 2.4 mou , yielding 2.5 tan of grain .
After the distribution , 29.2 mou remains &quot; communal property . &quot;
Ts &apos;ang @-@ hsia Village has 690.3 mou of fields .
Each person receives a share that yields 7.8 tan of grain .
Hsu @-@ yuan has over 820 mou of fields .
Method of distribution : Each person who stays in the village receives 3.5 mou .
The land is good , each mou yielding 5 lo ( 2 lo make 1 tan ) , so that 3.5 mou yields 17 lo .
Each worker receives 1.75 mou , or half of what a peasant gets .
Each person who has left to work elsewhere receives 1.4 mou .
Chin @-@ pi Village has 489 mou of fields .
Each person receives 2.7 mou , yielding 6 lo of grain .
Those who have left to work elsewhere get nothing .
Chou @-@ yuan Village has 510.5 mou of fields .
Each person receives 2.2 mou and gets 6 lo of grain from it .
Those who have left the village get nothing .
After the Red Army captured Chi @-@ an , four members of the reactionary lookout squadthe leader , his deputy , the secretary and a platoon leaderwere taken prisoner in Chi @-@ an .
They were sent under escort to T &apos;ung @-@ shu @-@ p1ing Ch &apos;u Government and executed .
All ordinary members of the squad joined in the revolution in this township and no one went to Chi @-@ an .
Three platoon leaders and 10 group leaders who stayed at home were not executed .
They were permitted to join in the revolution .
Yen Ch &apos;un @-@ wen , chairman of the township government , owned 8 mou of fields , yielding 24 lo of grain at only 3 lo a mou , and supporting a family of four .
At the first distribution of land in the seventh month , when both those at home and those who had left to work elsewhere received a share , Yen &apos;s family had 1,2 mou taken away from him , so that he now owned only 6.8 mou , capable of yielding 20 lo of grain or 5 lo for each member of the family .
After the capture of Chi @-@ an in the eighth month another distribution was made .
This time those who had left and found work elsewhere received nothing .
Only those who stayed behind and those who had left but could not find work elsewhere were given a share of 2.2 mou .
Since the family already had 8 mou , it received 0.8 mou .
The family owed a debt of 500 strings of coppers In the past .
A daughter ( 7 years old ) was sold in Chi @-@ an ( the buyer was from Kanchow , but operated a money @-@ lending shop in Chi @-@ an called Ho Mao ) for 100 yuan .
This the family paid the creditor , but another 200 strings of coppers was still outstanding .
Another daughter ( newly born ) was given away to the Catholic Church in Chi @-@ an , for which the family received nothing .
Investigations in Hsi @-@ i @-@ t &apos;ing
This is one of the villages of the 23d township of Ju &apos;fang Ch &apos;u of Chi @-@ an .
It is 15 li from Chi @-@ an .
Ju @-@ fang Ch &apos;u comprises over 30 townships .
There are nine village governments in this township .
Hsi @-@ i @-@ t &apos;ing Village has a population of about 600 .
The village government is run by five persons ; the chairman , a secretary , grain officer , land officer and a woman officer .
They all provide their own meals , as the village government does not provide board .
But when they gather together for some business ( such as a conference ) , the village government will
provide them with meals .
Public funds of the ancestral temple and other religious pools are combined for the use of the village government .
The village government &apos;s expenses consist of payments to Red Guards and Young Pioneers who are sent out on missions ( as in the attacks on Chi @-@ an and in attending conferences ) and to soldiers of the Independent Regiments for their meals ( 10 cents a day for each man ) .
This is the only payment .
No money is given for straw sandals , haircuts or cigarettes ,
Nineteen persons work for the township government : one chairman , two secretaries ( one works for the township government and the other for the Red Guards ) , a cultural officer , buyer , grain officer , land officer , Red Guards officer , social insurance officer , two women ( one chairman of the Women1s Committee , one in charge of organization ) &gt; a cook , a communications officer , one leader of Red Guards brigade , three leaders of Red Guards teams , one Red Guards instructor , and one Young Pioneer leader .
This township government began working on the ninth day of the sixth month .
It was unstable , because the reactionaries of Chi @-@ an often came to this township to arrest people , and when the enemy came the government moved out .
It was only after the capture of Chi @-@ an that township work began to develop .
The reactionaries took away 10 people , two of then were executed .
After the capture of Chi @-@ an , the eight prisoners were released , and over 20 reactionaries from this township were seized in Chi @-@ an .
Of these , six of the more brutal were executed , a number was released after paying a fine , and the remaining were sent under escort to T &apos;ung @-@ shupring Ch &apos;u Government .
The government is very busy now distributing land and grain , opposing debts , and setting up a school .
Land distribution is being made right now in this township .
Distribution is already made in five villages , taking each village as a unit .
But an order has come from the superior level , stating that distribution should be made on the basis of taking each township as a unit , so that distribution has got to be made again .
The opinion of the various villages is that distribution should be made on the basis of taking each village as a unit where the land owned by the village is extensive and each township as a unit where the land owned by the various villages is small .
Of the nine villages of this township , eight want the distribution based on village as a unit , only one wants it based on township as a unit .
The five villages where distribution is already made are Ting @-@ t &apos;ang , Pan @-@ chi @-@ k &apos;ang , T &apos;a&apos;shui , Hsin @-@ t &apos;ang and Hsia @-@ shang .
In Ting @-@ t &apos;ang the distribution is 2 mou ( yielding between 4 and 5 lo ) per capita .
In Fan @-@ chi @-@ k &apos;ang it is 2.5 mou per capita .
In T &apos;ashui and Hsiashang it is also 2 tnou per capita , but in Hsin @-@ t ? ang it is only 0.8 mou per capita .
Hsin @-@ t &apos;ang has little land and wants distribution based on the township as a unit .
Though the land of
Hsin @-@ t &apos;ang , with a population of about 200 all surnamed Huang ^ is small , it is all good land ( with no flooding disasters ) , some high , some low .
Chi @-@ an has been captured for more than a month , but distribution of land is not yet accomplished in this township .
It will take another 5 or 6 days to complete .
The anti @-@ debts struggle means creditors are required to surrender the pro @-@ misory notes they hold , so they may be destroyed .
Of the nine villages , only Kuan @-@ t &apos;ien has so far surrendered all promisory notes to the township government , but they are not yet destroyed .
The chairman of the township government has been dismissed by the Ch &apos;u Government .
Wang Yu @-@ t &apos;ang , the new chairman , has been here only 5 days .
Liu Ch &apos;uan @-@ sheng , the previous chairman , is a carpenter .
His family of three owns 1.8 mou of land .
He was made chairman in the sixth month .
Ju @-@ heng and Fang @-@ k &apos;uo were formerly two districts , but are now combined into one under the name of Ju @-@ heng Ch &apos;u .
The new chairman if this township government comes from Ju @-@ heng , but this township formerly belonged to Fang @-@ k &apos;uo Ch &apos;u .
Wang Yu @-@ tfang , a carpenter , owns 5 mou of land which yields 18 lo of grain for his family of four .
Besides being a carpenter , Wang also tills the land .
Over 70 men from this district have joined the Red Army .
Of these , over 40 are Young Pioneers , teenagers who are very brave .
The District Government is situated in TTung @-@ shup1ing .
Its chairman , Ch &apos;en Chun @-@ pin , is a rice miller .
&quot; Rural Surveys , &quot; Liberation Press , July 1947
LAND DISTRIBUTION IN WESTERN KIANGSI 12 @-@ 15 November 1930
&#91; Text &#93; These are delegates &apos; reports made during the expanded conference of the western Kiangsi Mobile Commission held on 12 November 1930 and the expanded conference of the Provincial Mobile Commission held on 15 November .
I made brief notes during the conferences , and , although they are very sketchy , from them one can see a small part of the land struggle in southwestern Kiangsi .
Distribution of Fields
Ch &apos;un @-@ hua : Townships are separated by as much as 10 li .
In one township the good and the bad &#91; fields &#93; were grouped for even distribution .
The first distribution took place in December of last year ( 1929 ) .
The second distribution took place in March of this year , taking the original tiller as the basic unit and taking from those with more to compensate those with less .
Now the third distribution is taking place , using the fertile &#91; land &#93; to compensate for the infertile * Distribution is beginning , and will take over 10 days to complete .
Ju @-@ yen : In December of last year ( 1929 ) , the fields of the bad gentry and landlords were distributed , but public fields and the fields of wealthy farmers had not yet been distributed .
In March of this year , all &#91; fields &#93; were confiscated and distributed in accordance with productive capacity .
In May , all &#91; fields &#93; were confiscated for the third time and distributed according to physical labor .
Yet it was not thoroughly equal in that some fertile land was taken from those with more fertile land while some infertile land was taken from those having more infertile land .
Equalization has not yet been accomplished by division into three classes , A , B and C.
The majority used the village as the basic unit ,
Shui @-@ tung : The township was used as the basic unit for all three distributions .
During the first , in January of last year , land was taken from those with more to compensate those with less .
During the second , in June , fertile land was taken to compensate for the infertile , but it was still incomplete
and many persons were dissatisfied with it .
The third distribution is now in process .
Land committee members of the various townships were concentrated at district level and land commissions were organized for mutual assistance in distribution , and to carry out the taking of fertile land to compensate for the infertile .
When Chi @-@ an was opened , over 1,000 .
people returned from the city and received land in the same manner as others .
On completion of this distribution , distribution will have been completed in 13 out of 17 townships .
Western District : Two distributions havetbeen made .
During the second one in August of this year , although distribution was made in three classes , upper , middle and lower , with the good and the bad &#91; fields &#93; distributed equally , it was actually not complete .
The township was the basic unit .
The township is too big , with the district fields being as much as 6 or 7 li away and unwanted by the farmers .
Recently the District Commission announced that the third distribution would be complete , taking fertile land to compensate for infertile land , and burning tax records and land titles , with five inspectors dispatched by the district to assist in the distribution .
Ju @-@ fang : The first &#91; distribution &#93; was in January of this year , with the good and the bad &#91; fields &#93; distributed equally .
It was incompletepublic fields remained .
In some cases the township was the basic unit and in some cases the village was the basic unit .
The second was in May , when the masses took the defector leaders &apos; fields and distributed them to the poor people ( those receiving distributed land for the first time ) .
In the third ( the current one ) , equal distribution was made to the upper , middle and lower classes .
Territory newly seized in the three or four townships in the Nan @-@ yu @-@ miao area has not been completely distributed .
Distribution is complete in Hsi @-@ yi @-@ t &apos;ing , where the township was the basic unit .
An @-@ fu : Distribution has not yet been made in places where there have been no defectorsdistribution was made first in places where there had been defections , with 10 days to complete distribution which was to be totally equal .
Distribution is half complete in seven districts , two @-@ thirds complete in five districts , and has not yet been done in the remaining turncoat places .
Among the nine districts in the county , the First District is not turncoat at all , one @-@ third of the Second District is not turncoat , half of the Third District is not turncoat , one @-@ third of the Fourth District is not turncoat , three @-@ fifths of the Fifth , Sixth and Seventh Districts is not turncoat , half the Eighth District is not turncoat , the Ninth Districtthe cityis completely turncoat , as is the 30 @-@ li area around the city .
The reason some areas are not turncoat is that they border on the red areas of Yung @-@ hsin , Lien @-@ hua and Yuan @-@ chou .
All non @-@ turncoat places are &quot; weak and small minority peoples &quot; who have been oppressed by the large villages .
Distribution of fields has been completed in all such places , taking from those with much to compensate those with little , but not yet taking the fertile to compensate for the infertile land .
Tung @-@ ku : The township was the basic unit .
Land was distributed in July of last year ( 1929 ) &apos; , taking fertile land to compensate for the infertile , and equalizing by division into three classes : A , B and C.
The second distribution has not yet taken place .
Later , because those serving in the Red Army had returned their land to the government , such land in the various villages was given to the villagers to till .
The masses of the people clamored , so the fields were evenly divided in July of last year under the slogan &quot; Group for evenness . &quot;
f ,
Hsia @-@ chiang : In the first distribution which took place in January and February of this year , the fields of the local tyrants and evil gentry were divided .
Public fields were divided during the second distribution held in March .
Fields of wealthy farmers were divided in the third distribution held in April and May , completing the distribution by taking the fertile to compensate for the infertile &#91; fields &#93; .
Taking the village as the basic unit , there were unwanted fields because there was much land and few people .
Two distributions have taken place in the newly developed areas .
The first distribution was carried out in haphazard fashion 2 weeks ago .
The second and current distribution must be completed in 5 days .
The good and the bad &#91; fields &#93; are being combined for even distribution .
Shui @-@ han : The first was made in March of this year , taking from those with much to compensate those with little .
For the second distribution carried out during August along the border of the White areas , land was taken from those with much to compensate those with little , but the fertile were not taken to compensate for the infertile .
In the remainder , fertile &#91; land &#93; was taken to compensate for the infertile .
Special distribution of good fields , however , was made to responsible members of the party headquarters and the farmers were directed to help work such fields .
Ju @-@ lin : The first distribution took place in March of this year , taking from those with much to compensate those with little .
In May the entire district defected .
In June the guard units were overthrown , and the second distribution of fields took place , with the fertile taken to compensate for the infertile in several townships , but in the great majority of townships distribution was performed in name only .
This was because the AB group was in control there .
The township was the basic unit with the village being the basic unit only under special circumstances ,
Yung @-@ hsin : In the Northwestern Special District , the old , young , and crippled who had no tilling capability received an additional half @-@ share .
It was also so resolved at the first County Delegates &apos; Plenary Conference , in addition , it was resolved to add to those receiving the additional half @-@ share those &quot; working personnel &quot; whose dependents did not have a tilling capability .
This was carried out in part of the Northwestern Special District , but was rejected by the Special Western Route Working Committee , because it stemmed from a charitable view , and was derided by some as the &quot; Orphan and Widow Line . &quot; In Yung @-@ hsin land distribution was performed twice throughout the county , the first after Lung @-@ yuan @-@ k &apos;ou was opened , the second was carried out in September after being decided upon by the Western Route Working Committee in June , Distribution has still not been completed
in one @-@ fifth of the county : the entire First District ( city ) , half of the Fourth District ( Nan @-@ hsiang ) , and the entire Fifth District ( Tung @-@ hsiang ) .
The farmers of Yung @-@ hsin wished to use production capacity as the standard for the distribution of fields , and this was accepted at the County Delegates Plenary Conference .
Chi @-@ shui : County seat and Feng @-@ shui fields have been distributed ; &#91; fields in &#93; Chin @-@ t &apos;an have not .
&quot; Distribute to people who can be seen . &quot; &quot; Group good with bad . &quot; &quot; Distribution was poor at the outset . &quot;
The &quot; Honan Fellows &quot; are a difficult problem .
In the township of Ku @-@ ts &apos;un , each person received only 2 tan worth of land &#91; production capacity &#93; .
Wan @-@ an : The village was the basic unit .
By the second distribution , the fertile were taken to compensate for the infertile .
Fen @-@ yi : Fields distributed with the village as the basic unit .
Division was by &#91; amounts of &#93; grain , not by field .
Over 2,000 houses were burned by the counterrevolutionaries , and for more than 20 li there were no old houses .
The Barren &#91; Fallow &#93; Field Situation
Tung @-@ ku : Each person received a minimum of 16 tan of grain ( a tan is about 80 catties ) ; many fields were uncultivated .
A large portion of the hills were fallow because it cost too much to harvest peaches ; nor were the hills dug up .
Cb &apos;un @-@ hua : Fields capable of producing 400 or 500 baskets lay fallow because ( 1 ) the March distribution occurred when farming was busy , the farmers had no family property , furniture or equipment , the land distributed was poor and distant , and ( 2 ) manpower was inadequate because of the elder sons serving in the Red Army and working outside ( that is to say 2,700 or 2,800 persons ) .
Shui @-@ tung : Several li were fallow .
This was because Lin @-@ shui at the Red @-@ White border was frequently harassed by the reactionaries of Chi @-@ an city .
Several hundred guards were required daily .
Three lines of guards were posted , and were frequently killed by the enemy at night .
Shui @-@ nan : Fields &#91; capable &#93; of &#91; producing &#93; several hundred tan of grain lie fallow because , when public fields are reserved , the farmers are unwilling to rent them for tilling , &quot; Having received distribution of fields &#91; capable &#93; of &#91; producing &#93; several tan of grain , I have enough to eat , and am unwilling to till public fields . &quot;
Ju @-@ lin : Fields of several thousand tan of grain lie fallow , with no one to harvest the ripe grain .
This is because the fields belonged to the
guards of the reactionary landlords and wealthy farmers , and when these people fled , the government did not distribute the fields to the farmers , so the farmers had no responsibility to till or harvest them ( Ju @-@ lin is a district near the city of Chi @-@ an ) .
An @-@ fu : Fields of 6,000 tan of grain lie fallow in the Tao @-@ p ? u and Ch &apos;ung @-@ wen Districts , because reactionary farmers are afraid to return to their homes in view of revenge @-@ ism for slaughter .
It was also because the distribution of fields was not thorough , having been on the basis of numbers only .
Both reasons stemmed from the mischief @-@ making led by the wealthy fanners .
An @-@ fu has much land and few people .
Most of the people from Hunan , Yung @-@ hsin and Honan work fields in An @-@ fu .
If you will only pay their taxes to the government , they will give you their fields to work .
Why are there sc few people ?
It is because many die because of poor sanitation .
Hsin @-@ yu : Fields of several hundred tan of grain lie fallow in three Red districts because part of the people left to serve in the Red Army .
Some &#91; fields &#93; are also fallow near the Red @-@ White border .
Fcn @-@ yi : Fields of several tans of grain lie fallow .
Yung @-@ hsin : Generally speaking , no fields are fallow , with total fields of less than 100 tan of grain lying fallow .
Kung @-@ nan : Much land lies fallow in all Red @-@ White border areas .
The Problem of Distributing Land to Workers
The farmers of Yung @-@ hsin opposed the sharing of land equally with the workers , but the Yung @-@ hsin Delegates Plenary Conference did not accept this view .
In one district in Tai @-@ ho the wages of workers were reduced after the distribution of land to them , but the wages were later restored .
In Chi @-@ an , workers who worked for less than a half @-@ year received their distribution of land accordingly , whereas those who worked for more than half the year received a half @-@ share of land .
The Problem of Distributing Hills
The Yung @-@ hsin Delegates Plenary Conference resolved that the township would be the basic unit in tea @-@ producing hills , with equal distribution made according to population .
The Chi @-@ an Delegates Plenary Conference ( October 1930 ) resolved that bamboo @-@ covered and tree @-@ covered hills would not be divided but would be controlled by the township soviet and used by the farmers .
Those needing bamboo or wood must get the government &apos;s permission to cut &#91; bamboo or trees &#93; .
Reeds and grass may be freely cut and taken from hills .
Tea @-@ oil hills in Yung @-@ hsin , Hsia @-@ chiang , , Yen @-@ fu , Ju @-@ hsing , Tung--ku , T &apos;ai @-@ ho and the Western District have all been equally divided .
Ju @-@ fang and Ch &apos;un @-@ hua have no hills producing tea and oil .
The hills of Wan @-@ an have not been divided .
Fen @-@ yi : On 5 November of this year ( 1930 ) , the Provincial Mobile Commission dispatched Liu Lin @-@ tung to participate in the County Mobile Commission , which passed by the County Workers Partners and Soldiers Plenary Conference .
The method was : &quot; Hills worth over 300 yuan will be turned over to the Soviets .
Hills worth less than 300 yuan will be controlled by the original owners . &quot; In May and June of this year ( before the 2d Plenary Conference ) , however , because of the receipt of orders from higher authority ( the Fourth Expanded Conference of the Northern Route Mobile Commission ) , the township had already been taken as the basic unit in equal distribution of hills , although no meeting had been held in this county .
This decision was reversed in November , and the farmers were very dissatisfied .
There are seven types of hills : ( 1 ) lumber &#91; producing &#93; , ( 2 ) miscellaneous food , ( 3 ) raw material , ( 4 ) bamboo and wood ( large and small ) , ( 5 ) firewood ( reed and grass hills and firewood hills ) , ( 6 ) mines and ( 7 ) barren hills .

MISTAKES IN LAND STRUGGLE IN KIANGSI 14 November 1930
&#91; Text &#93; On 14 November 1930 , the Kiangsi Provincial Committee met in Chi @-@ an .
After the reports of Comrades Ch &apos;en Yi , Ch &apos;en Cheng @-@ jen , and Ma Ming , I spoke as the representative of past committee members , pointing out that the line continually followed within the Western and Southern Kiangsi Party after the &quot; Second Plenary Conference &quot; of cancelling land reform had been discussed in conference , and all acknowledged that a determined struggle must be carried out against this incorrect line .
The following are a few important points which I recorded during the reports of Comrades Ch &apos;en Yi , Ch &apos;en Cheng @-@ jen and Ma King , and only I can understand many of them .
Ju @-@ lin District : Wash away loyal comrades , leaving the homogeneous AB group .
Red areas : Wealthy farmers control the economy .
Yung @-@ hsin : Wealthy farms control the food .
The government &apos;s policy of suppressing wealthy farmers is correct .
District Committee secretaries do not visit townships to inspect .
The views of the Central Committee and higher authority are not transmitted to lower levels .
&quot; Kill all wealthy farmers and landlords . &quot; &quot; Must divide firmly . &quot;
Use the White Terror in discussing the policy of wealthy farmers cheating poor fanners , &quot; White Symbol . &quot;
When the line is not clearly specified , the wealthy farmers will encircle and deceive , as was the case in the Fourth District Committee of Yung @-@ hsin ( Ma Ming is the secretary ) .
Distribution of the fields of the Eastern Route has not been completed at all .
In the Southern Route , distribution has only been completed in the Hsing @-@ kuo and Kung counties .
Tseng is a superior man .
Eighty percent of the Jui @-@ chin Party is landlords and wealthy farmers ; over 80 excellent party members , over 30 landlords and wealthy farmers including the head of the counterrevolutionary guard unit .
No fields have been distributed in 2 months .
The grain of the local tyrants remnants has been taken away .
The youth of the masses of the East Route are brave , the Youth Corps is cowardly .
Women have not struggled .
&quot; Everything must be divided , this is the farmers1 consciousness . &quot;
There &#91; are &#93; many wealthy farmers but few poor farmers in the tea hills .
Failure to divide tea hills is to the benefit of the wealthy fanners .
Village peoples &apos; schools are also benefits of the wealthy farmers , inasmuch as the children of poor farmers have to work , so few of them attend school .
Wealthy farmers order the masses to fight to protect the interests of the wealthy farmers .
The officers of the Hsin @-@ feng Red Guards are all wealthy farmers .
&quot; Seize names , &quot; &quot; adjust fields , &quot; &quot; fight butchers , &quot; &quot; fines . &quot;
With the slogan of protecting Red areas , the wealthy farmers of the northwestern townships of Hsin @-@ feng incite Red troops to desert and return home .
The wealthy farmers are an obstacle to the expansion of the Red Army .
The problem of preferential treatment for Red Army dependents .
In Yung @-@ hsin , preferential treatment was not afforded to Red Army volunteers , and no assistance was provided in tilling their fields .
The dependents of those dispatched by the government were treated preferentially .
Hsin @-@ feng ; Those members of local Red defense units killed or wounded in action were treated preferentially .
Those killed or wounded in action in the 22d Army were ignored , The wealthy farmers played tricks .
Only wealthy fanners opposed freedom of marriage .
Saying &quot; The farmers oppose it &quot; is a lack of differentiation .
At the Second Plenary Conference , eliminate farmers , cancel land reform .
Li Wen @-@ lin went to the Southern Route on 24 August , He did not make a specialized report on land reform .
There was no specialized discussion ,
At the Southern Route Expanded Conference of 15 July , Ch &apos;en Yi put forth eight principles such as immediate distribution of fields and harvesting of grain , taking from those with much to compensate those with little , taking the fertile to compensate for the infertile , unconditional distribution of housing , division of hills and woods , division of ponds , and so on , which were promulgated by the Southern Kiangsi Revolutionary Committee .
The wealthy farmers of Jui @-@ chin and Yu @-@ tu &#91; 7184 6757 &#93; , citing Article 14 of the &quot; Western and Southern Kiangsi Land Law &quot; the original tiller should be the ownerspoke loudly of not violating the land law , but their violation was counterrevolution , even to the extent of &quot; fighting . &quot; The Revolutionary Committee had to issue this official announcement .
There was some interactioa between the two cooks at the Expanded Conference .
&quot; It &apos;s hereditary , so now he wants to be chairman too ? &quot;
Afraid that the communists &quot; won &apos;t talk , just chop off heads . &quot;
&quot; Even if you paid your rent in years past , this field can &apos;t be worked ! &quot;
Red Army wives and freedom of marriage .
&quot; Will you serve in the Red Army ?
If you serve in the Red Army , 1 cannot marry you . &quot; &quot; If people report that you have been killed in the Red Army , must I still observe the festivals for you ? &quot; &quot; Eight yuan for 80 catties of meat . &quot; &quot; Yesterday I went to him , today I go to the Chairman .
That &apos;s freedom . &quot; &quot; Reporting to the West River Combined Conference , Ch &apos;en Chi @-@ chung washed away the atmosphere of Ch &apos;en Yi ( After 9 days of meetings , Ch &apos;en Yi had resolved a detailed land law .
Arriving on the tenth day , Ch &apos;en Chih @-@ chung cancelled it . )
&quot; Confiscation of the land of the landlords and dividing it equally is only a temporary measure rather than an objective , nor will it develop a land law of proletarian consciousness . &quot;
Hsieh Han @-@ ch &apos;ang transmitted the message in the Northern Route : &quot; Using labor is the standard in the poor fanners * consciousness . &quot;
The body strength of poor farmers does not equal that of wealthy farmers ( poor farmers have nothing to eat ) ; nor are the sons of poor farmers strong .
Li Tui @-@ ts &apos;ung said , &quot; At the Second Plenary Conference no one had a grasp &#91; of the subject &#93; , so the land question could not .be discussed . &quot;
In the Western Route the message was transmitted ( by Chou Kao @-@ ch &apos;ao ) : &quot; To divide everything is the poor farmers7 consciousness . &quot;
On 28 October an expanded conference was held at Hsin @-@ feng by the Southern Route Mobil Commission , at which Kuo transmitted the message : &quot; Take the fertile to compensate for the infertile , make thoroughly equal distribution . &quot; Yet after a day and a half of meetings , it had not been discussed , and there was no resolution ,
The two lines of Southern Kiangsi ( as stated by Ch &apos;en Yi ) : &quot; Yung @-@ hsin is not the wealthy fanners &apos; line .
I oppose , &quot; said Ma ,
&quot; I don &apos;t agree with entering deeply into land reform , &quot; Tuan Liang @-@ pi said to Chfen Cheng @-@ jen ,
&quot; To expand and deepen simultaneously is the total farmer consciousness .
&quot; To fail to attack Chi @-@ an , and to attack Kiu @-@ kiang later , will irrevocably lose the high tide of the Chinese revolution , &quot; so reported the Special Committee to the Central Committee .

HARVEST DISTRIBUTION AND RENT PROBLEMS 15 November 1930
&#91; Text &#93; On 15 November 1930 , the Kiangsi Provincial Mobile Committee held an expanded conference at Chi @-@ an .
Besides members of the Provincial Committee and the Standing Committee , those attending the conference included the chairman of the Yung @-@ hsin , Chi @-@ an , T &apos;ai @-@ ho , Wan @-@ an , Chi @-@ shui , An @-@ fu , Fen @-@ yi and Hsia @-@ chiang Soviets as well as Comrade Ch &apos;en Yi of the 22d Army .
I participated in this conference as the representative of past committee members .
The special feature of this conference was the discussion of two problems : harvest distribution and rent .
With regard to harvest distribution , I brought up the mass basis of support for harvest distribution .
With regard to the renting of land , the previously prevalent leftist but actually wealthy farmer theory of &quot; Rent should not be collected in soviet areas &quot; was overthrown .
In addition , the Chiang Han @-@ po &#91; 3068 3352 3134 &#93; method of distribution according to labor was opposed by pointing out that its error lay in helping wealthy farmers while it was contrary to the interests of poor farmers .
This conference broke up prematurely because reactionary troops had already reached Hsia @-@ chiang , and those responsible for the various counties had to return to prepare to deal with the enemy .
Therefore such questions scheduled for discussion as &quot; Mountain forests , &quot; &quot; Ponds , &quot; &quot; Housing , &quot; &quot; Fallow Fields , &quot; &quot; Unemployment , &quot; and &quot; Debt &quot; were not discussed .
A serious enemy offensive and the Fu @-@ t &apos;ien Incident occurred after the conference .
So for this reason the resolutions of the conference have still not been promulgated .
What follows is a brief record made by me during the day &apos;s conference .
I retained it because it contained some important material .
Distribution of Fields in Ch &apos;un @-@ hua With the District as the Basic Unit
The third distribution of fields in ChTun @-@ hua District ( October 1930 ) had progressed to using the district as the basic unit , taking a census of population and production capacity to determine how much land each person should receive .
Then distribution was made within the scope of the township , &quot; shifting fields where possible and shifting people where fields could not be shifted . &quot; Now the more than 30,000 persons in Ch &apos;un @-@ hua District have each received an equal amount of land ( each person received land capable of producing 11 shlh of grain , with each shih equal to 44 catties ) .
Deficiencies of Distribution of Fields With the Village as the Basic Unit
The deficiencies in using the village as the basic unit are ; ( 1 ) large villages are unwilling to give up fields to small villages ; ( 2 ) with too many basic units , it is not easy for district and township governments to press &#91; the program &#93; , so many concealed deficiencies developed ; and ( 3 ) within a single village , it was easy for the masses to be hoodwinked through the use of surname @-@ ism by landlords and wealthy farmers and not thoroughly divide land evenly , nor thoroughly combat local tyrants .
This view is worth noting .
The Land Struggle Cannot Be Deepened at a Stroke
In the distribution of land , no matter how many times the land is divided , the wealthy farmers always conceal the good land the first time , making it impossible to investigate and to classify the land into the three grades : upper , middle and lower .
Wealthy farmers and middle farmers always lead the first time , while the poor farmers have no authority , &quot; After some period of unrest , the proletariat will arise . &quot; This view is correct .
Yang Ch &apos;eng @-@ fu &apos;s &#91; 2799 2052 5346 &#93; Plan for &quot; The Socialization of Agriculture &quot;
Yang Ch &apos;eng @-@ fu , chairman of the Chi @-@ art County Government ( originally chairman and secretary of Ch &apos;un @-@ hua District Committee ) , was determined to achieve common tilling and expenditure of &#91; the proceeds of &#93; the land in three steps : the first was to distribute land with the district as the basic unit , the second was to organize cooperatives and the third was to share in the tilling and expenditure .
This is completely erroneous .
The Chiang Han @-@ po &#91; 3068 3352 3134 &#93; Style of Distribution According to Labor
The deficiency of using labor as the basis for distribution of land is that orphans , widows , the elderly , infants , women with small &#91; bound &#93; feet , and all people unable to till the land , would not have enough to eat .
Even poor farmers of great laboring capacity are no match for wealthy farmers because poor farmers do not have the oxen , farming implements and capital of the wealthy farmers .
In addition , wealthy farmers can lease the land of the orphaned , widowed , elderly , infants , women with small feet , and others .
Therefore , using labor as the basis for distribution is of benefit only to wealthy farmers .
The &quot; Chiang Han @-@ po Method &quot; using labor as the basic unit was carried out in the &quot; border areas &quot; along An @-@ fu &apos;s boundary with Chi @-@ an and Fen @-@ yi as well as in Yen @-@ fu Township in Chi @-@ an .
It was also carried out absolutely , regardless of age , distribution was made to those with the capacity for labor and not to those without it .
Distribution was made to vagrants .
Those with no capacity for labor would receive food from the farming of those with the capacity for labor .
A member of the Political Committee of the Third Army Group who came to Chi @-@ an said to Wang Huai &#91; 3769 2037 &#93; that the land
distribution method on the border of Hunan , Hupeh and Riangsi took labor as the basic unit , with those with no capacity for labor receiving a half @-@ share , and with nothing furnished by the government .
When labor is used as the basic unit for distribution , the wealthy farmers , with much land , need to use their oxen , plows and harrows themselves , so the poor farmers cannot even borrow them .
It is only by equal distribution that poor farmers will be able to borrow the excess farming implements of the wealthy fanners , therefore the poor farmers demand equal distribution .
Harvest Distribution Problems
Part of the farmers of Jui @-@ chin and Yu @-@ tu &#91; 7184 6757 &#93; upheld the slogan of the Ting @-@ chou &#91; 3060 1558 &#93; Conference : &quot; Unconditional distribution of the harvest &quot; ; while others upheld the slogan of the Pi @-@ t &apos;ou &#91; 7095 7333 &#93; Conference : &quot; Do not distribute green young sprouts &quot; ; and the pretext was : &quot; Do not break the Land Law . &quot;
Land was distributed in the county of the Northern Route in May of this year .
Compensation was provided for capital and for original tillers at the rate of 600 cash per shih of grain &#91; capacity &#93; .
In Fu @-@ t ? ien the wealthy farmers were not compensated for their land while poor farmers received a string of cash per tan of grain for their land .
Land was distributed in Chrun @-@ hua in March , at which , time no planting had been done , plowing had been done only once and fertilizer had been spread in a few cases , After distribution no compensation was paid for capital .
On the Northern Route , compensation of 600 cash or a string of cash was paid for capital on each shih of grain .
Before May , the county had resolved that the price of grain would be 4 strings &#91; of cash &#93; per shih , with compensation paid at the rate of one @-@ sixth or one quarter , Land had not yet been distributed at the time , and it was a period of famine , so prescribing the price of grain at 4 strings was intended to help the poor farmers by equalizing the price of grain .
After the harvest , however , the price was still fixed at 4 strings per shih .
&quot; This is incorrect . &quot;
In Yung @-@ hsin during the fifth month of the old calendar last year , the government of the Fifth District of the Northwestern Special Area prescribed that land distribution would take place when the early grain crop was about to ripen .
Persons entering land would compensate those leaving the land 1 yuan &quot; big money &quot; for every 2 tan of grain ( 200 catties , which is a shih of land ) .
Rice is harvested once a year .
In May , when the seedlings have just been transplanted , the rice is still not fully grown , so persons leaving the land were compensated a string of cash for each shih of land ( 2 tan of grain ) .
The County Committee had decided that land would be received without compensation , but because of restricted communications , the Fifth District did not receive the direction of the County Committee , and therefore proceeded according to its own decision .
The wealthy farmers in the eastern townships of Yu @-@ tu and the northwestern part of Kung County requested compensation of 2 yuan &quot; small money &quot; ( worth 4 strings ) for each piece of land producing a shih of grain ( actually only 8 tou ) .
The party prohibited this and land was received without compensation .
A legitimate policy should be : &quot; To receive land without compensation , and to divide both land and harvest . &quot; Equal distribution would be made for uniform application to family members of landlords .
Assessments should be made separately against landlords who have much money .
Vagrants should receive equal distribution because they work hard .
The wealthy farmers &apos; opposition to vagrants1 sharing the harvest is wrong .
Middle farmers , not having much land to be distributed , would not be affected .
Although the &quot; top layer of poor farmers &quot; which tills much land would be affected , there will be other benefits to compensate them .
The broad masses of the low level poor farmers , manual laborers and tenant farmers support this method 100 percent .
After the distribution of the harvest , those not having the strength to cultivate their land would be permitted to follow the rental method .
Consolidating Original Tillers for Equal Distribution
In the past , using the &quot; village &quot; and &quot; family &quot; as the basic unit and the original tiller as the criterion for equal distribution , resulted in benefit for the wealthy farmers but not for the poor farmers .
The legitimate way should be : taking the township as the basic unit according to the total population of the township divided by the total of the original tillers of land in the entire township ( total township population is the total of those who originally tilled land in the village as well as those who originally tilled land in other villages ) , taking from those with much to compensate those with little , taking the fertile to compensate for the infertile , shifting land when it can be shifted ( villages with more land would give part of their land to villages with less land ) .
When land cannot be shifted , move people ( when distances are great , there is no way to shift land , so people must be moved ) .
This method is called &quot; Distribution by Consolidating Original Tillers . &quot;
The Non @-@ laboring Population and the New Land Rental System
When people without the capacity for labor rent their land to those with laboring capacity to farm , the tenant hands over grain , as rent to the owner .
In Ch &apos;un @-@ hua , Wan @-@ an and Hsin @-@ yu four @-@ tenths was handed over ; in Fen @-@ yi and Ning @-@ tu five @-@ tenths was handed over ; and in Yung @-@ hsin one @-@ third was handed over .
The land in Fu @-@ t &apos;ien ( a district of Chi @-@ an ) was divided into three classes &apos;upper , middle and lower .
For the upper class four @-@ tenths was handed over , for the middle class three @-@ tenths , and for the lower class two @-@ tenths was handed over .
This appears to be comparatively reasonable .
In Ch &apos;un @-@ hua , An @-@ fu , T &apos;ai @-@ he , Hsin @-@ yu , Fen @-@ yi and Hsia @-@ chiang , those without the capacity for labor who wish to rent their land comprise about 20 percent of the population .
In Ning @-@ tu they comprise over 20 percent because of the number of women with small &#91; bound &#93; feet .
In Yung @-@ hsin they comprise only 5 percent because the women all have big &#91; unbound &#93; feet , and the renters are mostly widowed , orphaned , crippled , aged , very young or engaged in revolutionary work .
The above refers only to that portion of the population in which the entire family lacks the capacity for labor and must rent its land .
There are even more of the population who do not have the capacity for labor but who have family members who can farm the land , and thus do not have to rent their land .
Generally speaking , 75 percent of the entire population does not have the capacity for labor , that is , only one out of every four persons is a young man strong enough to till the land @-@ this is China &apos;s big problem .
This so @-@ called lack of laboring capacity , however , refers to actual tilling of the land .
About half of them have a partial capacity for such labor as tending cattle , chopping wood , cooking rice , washing clothes and preparing food .
Statistically :
25 percenthave full capacity for labor
37.5 percent @-@ have half @-@ capacity or some capacity for labor
37.5 percenthave no capacity at all for labor .
The &quot; Renting Land for Grain &quot; in all the above @-@ mentioned areas is the so @-@ called &quot; Grain Distribution System &quot; except for Ch &apos;uni @-@ hua &apos;s , which is the &quot; Rental System . &quot; The deficiency in the grain distribution system is that those renting land &#91; from others &#93; emphasize their own land , and invest effort and fertilizer haphazardly in the landowner &apos;s land .
When the grain is ripe , it Is shared according to the amount harvested , equally , or on a four @-@ to @-@ six or other ratio .
This system is not beneficial to the owner of the rented land .
With the rental system , the rent is fixed without regard to the amount harvested .
Therefore the tenant is attentive to the expenditure of effort and fertilizer , which is of benefit to both production and the owner of the land .
The deficiencies of the rental system are :
( 1 ) Fixed rent is detrimental to the tenant in disaster years .
( 2 ) It is also detrimental to the tenant when Red Guard units are called out for many farming days and farming is reduced .
In summary , the grain distribution system is of benefit to the wealthy farmers , while the rental system is of benefit to the poor farmers .
A legitimate policy would be as follows :
( 1 ) Should poor farmers , tenant farmers and the unemployed lack oxen , farming implements or capital after receiving land , the government should distribute surplus oxen , farming implements and other items confiscated
from wealthy farmers and landlords to the tenant farmers , poor farmers , the unemployed and others for their own farming .
At.the same time , the collective use of such implements should be rewarded , and some items confiscated from wealthy farmers and landlords given to cooperatives .
Yet another method is for individuals to borrow oxen and farming implements temporarily from wealthy farmers for support , with the government controlling those wealthy farmers who wilfully fail to lend their things , so as to help the poor farmers , tenant farmers and the unemployed .
( 2 ) Those totally unable to till the land should be permitted to rent their land to wealthy and middle farmers to till under the following conditions :
( a ) Abolish the grain distribution system , prescribing a fixed rental , with no reduction for disasters .
( b ) Prescribe the minimum rental ( 50 percent ) to preclude excessive exploitation of poor and tenant farmers by wealthy farmers .
( c ) Do not permit wealthy farmers to use the pretext of farming only their own land and not that of others .
Should a wealthy farmer be willing to rent land , the township government should take all land which must be rented and distribute it among the wealthy and middle farmers of the township , forcing them to farm it .
The Problem of Unemployed Workers From Cities Requesting Land
Over 200 unemployed masons and carpenters in the city of T &apos;ai @-@ he &#91; 3141 0735 &#93; requested that land be distributed to them , but received none .
They were from outside counties and the farmers of the city area would not permit land to be distributed to them .
The sugar cane workers from outside Nan @-@ men City also requested the distribution of land .
This problem also occurred in Hsing @-@ kuo &#91; 5281 0948 &#93; .
This problem deserves careful and deliberate consideration .
o Investigations of Farm Villages , Liberation Press , July 1947 .
INVESTIGATION AT MU @-@ K &apos;OTJ VILLAGE 21 November 1930
&#91; Text &#93; On 18 November 1930 , the Red Army abandoned Chi @-@ an .
On the 19th I went with Comrades Ku Pai &#91; 0657 2672 &#93; and Hsieh Wei @-@ chun &#91; 6200 0787 0193 &#93; from Chi @-@ an to Heng @-@ t &apos;ien &#91; 5899 3944 &#93; , which belongs to Yung @-@ feng &#91; 3057 6265 &#93; , to meet with the Main Force of the Red Army .
Passed through Shui @-@ nan &#91; 3055 0589 &#93; to Pai @-@ sha &#91; 4101 3097 &#93; , ate lunch at Mu @-@ k &apos;ou &#91; 2606 0656 &#93; Village , and investigated the composition of the members of the village government and the reactionary elements killed in this village .
This investigation proved that , in the equal distribution of land , the middle farmers not only do not lose but even gain ; and that wealthy farmers and small landlords , in the intense struggle of the farmers , will go over to the counterrevolutionary camp .
Mu @-@ k &apos;ou Village of the 8th Township , Shui @-@ nan District , Chi @-@ shui &#91; 0679 3055 &#93; County
There are 200 people in the entire village .
There are 46 able @-@ bodied adults , all of whom have been enrolled in Red Guards units :
The village government is established in the ancestral hall &apos; .
There are nine functionaries in the village government : Chairman , Secretary , Committee Member for Land , Committee Member for Social Insurance , Committee Member for Red Guards , Committee Member for Food , Committee Member for Adjudication , Committee Member for Women , and Committee Member for Youth .
Chairman Liu Hsing @-@ nan &#91; 0491 5281 0589 &#93; ( small landlord ) , two persons to feed , has 56 shih of land ( each shih of land produces 3 baskets of grain and each basket of land 10 catties ) .
Farms over 10 shih and rents 40 shih .
Because of his liking for gambling , he has no money to lend .
During this distribution of land , most of his land was given up .
Secretary P &apos;eng Chia @-@ fa &#91; 1756 1367 4099 &#93; ( middle farmer ) eight persons to feed , has land for 48 shih of grain and rented &#91; from others &#93; over 20 shih more &#91; of land &#93; , has enough to eat , and has no debts .
By this distribution each person received
7 shih and 8 tou , totaling 64 shih ; thus he received 16 shih in the distribution , proof that middle farmers receive land in the distribution .
Committee Member for Land Liu Hsing @-@ wen &#91; 0491 5281 2429 &#93; ( poor farmer ) , three persons to feed , land for 10 shih of grains and not enough to eat .
He received 14 shih in this distribution , and in the past had debts of 60 yuan .
&quot; Committee Member for Social Insurance &quot; Wu K &apos;ai @-@ lien &#91; 0124 7030 6647 &#93; ( poor farmer ) , has four persons to feed , 16 shih of grain land , not enough to eat , and rented over 20 shih from others .
He received 15 shih and 2 tou in this distribution , and had debts in the past .
Committee Member for Red Guards P &apos;eng Chia @-@ hsiung &#91; 1756 1367 0338 &#93; ( middle farmer ) , one person to feed in the past , 12 shih of grain land , sold 6 shih to repay high @-@ interest debts , leaving 6 shih which gave him enough to eat .
He also worked as a day laborer , had no wife , and could not feed pigs .
Liking to gamble , he had debts of 30 yuan .
After the revolution , he &quot; acquired &quot; a wife .
The wife brought with her a 13 @-@ year @-@ old son and a 13 @-@ year @-@ old daughter @-@ in @-@ law .
Now , with four people to receive distribution of land , each person receiving 7 shih and 8 tou , they receive a total of 31 shih and 2 tou .
Speaking in terms of the individual , originally having only 6 shih and now receiving 7 shih and 8 tou , an increase of 1 shih and 8 tou , is another proof of middle farmers receiving land from the distribution .
Committee Member for Food Hsu Chuan @-@ chang &#91; 1776 0278 4545 &#93; ( poor farmer ) , one person to feed , had only 2 shih of grain land , which was not enough and he had to work as a day laborer .
Now he has received through the distribution 5 shih and 8 tou , and still does not have a wife .
Chairman P &apos;eng &#91; sic &#93; Hsing @-@ nan also serves as Committee Member for Adjudication .
Committee Member for Women Yang Chiu @-@ ying &#91; 2799 0046 5391 &#93; ( middle farmer ) , five persons to feed , has 50 shih of grain land .
With her husband and her father farming , there is enough to eat but no excess , and she has no debts .
From this distribution , she received 6 shih of grain landanother proof of middle farmers receiving land through distribution .
Of the above seven functionaries of the village government , one a small landlord , three middle farmers and three poor farmers , all middle fanners received land through the distribution .
Revolution began in this village the year before last , and land was .distributed in January of this year ( distribution was from Tung @-@ ku &#91; 2639 0942 &#93; District- this village previously belonged to Tung @-@ ku ) , All members of the village government feed themselves , and the revolution came along without arousing violent opposition .
A total of seven reactionaries have been killed in this village : P &apos;eng Cnia @-@ kuang &#91; 1756 1367 0342 &#93; , P &apos;eng Chia @-@ shan &#91; 1756 1367 0810 &#93; , P ? eng Chia @-@ chun &#91; 1756 1367 0193 &#93; , P &apos;eng Pei @-@ chun &#91; 1756 0971 &#93; , P &apos;eng Ch &apos;ang @-@ lung &#91; 1756 2490 7127 &#93; , P &apos;eng Ch &apos;ang @-@ hsi &#91; 1756 2490 4406 &#93; , and Wen Chih @-@ kuei &#91; 3306 1807 6311 &#93; .
P &apos;eng Chia @-@ kuang ( small landlord ) , three persons to feed , had over 30 shih of grain land , was proprietor of a cloth shop in Shui @-@ nan , rented his land to others to farm and collected the rent .
Business was bad in the shop , which lost money every year .
Handled the collection of taxes of the 38th Tu and sought profit in so doing .
Smoked opium , a scholar and a very villainous member of the gentry .
P &apos;eng Chia @-@ shan ( wealthy
farmer ) , younger brother of Chia @-@ kuang , five persons to feed , had over 40 shih of grain land , and had money to lend .
Saddened because of the cancellation of debts , he joined with Honan bandits , and was captured and killed along with his elder brother in July of last year .
P &apos;eng Chia @-@ chun &#91; 1756 1367 0193 &#93; ( vagrant ) , three persons to feed , had no land and owed debts to others .
Joining the revolution , he served as adjutant in the Tung @-@ ku guerrillas .
He also served as executive officer and quartermaster .
Later he deserted , acquired three guns and became a bandit , preying on local tyrants .
He was captured last year and killed .
He liked to play cards .

Wen Chih @-@ kuei ( wealthy farmer ) , seven persons to feed , 30 shih of grain land , rented over 100 shih , besides his own labor , he hired an old person and many day laborers , did not lend money , but engaged in small business carrying ducks and oil seeds to sell .
He plotted with the Honan bandits to leak information of the revolution and was killed .
( The so @-@ called Honan bandits were part of the Honanese who had moved &apos;to Chi @-@ shui County in Kiangsi , some of whom became bandits . )
The above seven reactionary elements who were killed : three small landlords , three wealthy farmers and one vagrant @-@ H ^ oved that , when land reform deepens , many small landlords and wealthy farmers will move in the direction of counterrevolution .
Whether every one of these seven persons should have been killed , however , is a question .

INVESTIGATIONS IN HSING @-@ KUO COUNTY 26 January 1931
&#91; Text &#93; In September 1930 the Red 1st Army returned to Kiangsi following Its attack on Changsha .
In early October after breaking through Chi @-@ an it entered the Yuan River Valley where many peasants came from Hsing @-@ kuo to join the ranks of the Red Army .
I took this opportunity to conduct an investigation of the 10th ( Yung @-@ feng ) District in Hsing @-@ kuo County .
I got together and held fact @-@ finding meetings with eight persons , namely , Fu Chi @-@ t &apos;ing , Li Ch &apos;ang @-@ ying , Wen Feng @-@ chang , Ch &apos;en Chen @-@ shan , Chung Te @-@ wu , Huang Ta @-@ ch &apos;un , Ch &apos;en Pei @-@ p &apos;ing and Lei Han @-@ hsiang .
The investigation was undertaken at the end of October 1930 with Lo @-@ fang , Hsin @-@ yu County as the meeting place where a series of fact @-@ finding meetings were held for a full week .
Yung @-@ feng District is situated at the intersection of three adjoining counties of Hsing @-@ kuo , Kan @-@ hsien and Wan @-@ an .
It is divided into four townships , of which the old Ling @-@ yuan District is the 1st , Tung @-@ chiang the 2d , Shan @-@ k &apos;eng the 3d and Chiang @-@ t &apos;uan the 4th , with Yung @-@ feng @-@ yu of the 2d township as the political and economic center of this district .
The distribution of population is as follows : the 1st township has 3,000 people , the 2d 800 , the 3d 3,000 and the 4th 4,000 , so the total population of this district is 8 * 800 .
Because this district is bounded by the three counties of Hsing @-@ kuo , Kan @-@ hsien and Wan @-@ an , so if the situation in this district is well understood , there is not much difference in that of the other two counties .
In fact , conditions of struggle for land are not much different in the whole region of southern Kiangsi .
Practical policy must be determined on the basis of actual conditions .
Things which you sit around the house imagining about or which you read from sketchy written reports are definitely not those based on actual conditions .
It is dangerous to base decision of policy on reports which were either unrealistic or &quot; believed to be true . &quot; In the past many mistakes were made in the Red areas because the leadership of the party had not been in keeping with actual conditions .
It is , therefore , most essential to make detailed scientific investigations based on actual conditions .
Generally speaking , this investigation is still not penetrating enough even though it is more so compared with those made on previous occasions .
First , I have made an investigation of eight families , something which I have never attempted before .
The truth is that without
243this kind of investigation it is impossible to have basic ideas about the rural areas .
Second , I have tried to find out the manifestations of land struggle among various classes of people in Hsun @-@ wu but my investigation is not complete .
The shortcomings of this investigation are that I have not included in it the situations of the children and women , the situations of exchange and comparison of commodity prices , the situations in .
farm production after the land distribution , and the cultural situations .
All these aspects were intended to be investigated had it not been for the enemy attack on Lo @-@ fang .
Because the Red Army had decided on the policy of luring the enemy deep into our area , we were forced to conclude our fact @-@ finding meetings .
The data given below was gathered in this way : I drew in an outline of investigation , then everyone was asked questions followed by a discussion ; all conclusions were submitted by me ; after they were agreed to by the eight comrades I put them down in writing .
On some points no conclusions were reached , but their answers were described .
Our fact @-@ finding meetings had been lively and interesting .
Two or three meetings were held every day with some lasting into the late night but they did not feel tired .
For this we should be deeply grateful to these comrades .
Some participants are members of the Communist Party but the majority of them are no t .
A Survey of Eight Families 1 .
Fu Chi @-@ t &apos;ing
A native of the 1st township of the 10th District , He runs a small butcher shop but has no capital .
There are five persons to be fed .
He has a rice field of 23 shih ( piculs ) on which 3 shih must be paid as rent leaving him with a balance of 20 shih .
Now each of the five persons eats 7 shih totaling 35 shih resulting in a shortage of 15 shih which must be made up by the business in his butcher shop .
He can make a profit of about 1.30 yuan for each pig slaughtered ( there are no more large pigs to be killed so he can only earn about 0.50 yuan per pig killed ) .
The five persons are : father , 80 years old ; wife cooks , raises pigs , makes firewood , washes and mends clothes , but tills no field ; son , 5 years old ; daughter , 1 year old ; and himself , 39 , tilling field and slaughtering pigs .
In addition to his own , he rents another field of 5 shih but has to hire someone to help him till it for 1 month every year .
His mother died 5 years ago .
He spent over 100 yuan for her burial .
Apart from his brother &apos;s contributing share , he has to go into debt for 50 small yuan which with compound interest added had already come to 150 yuan this year .
Out of the 23 shih of rice field , 17 shih were owned by himself , and 6 shih were &quot; t &apos;ui @-@ chiao ^ t &apos;ien &quot; belonging to the public lands of Chung @-@ wu in Pai @-@ lu ( a subdivision of Kan @-@ hsien , 10 li from the 1st township of the 10th District ) .
For 6 shih of this public field he had to pay 6 small yuan per shih totaling 36 yuan as mortgage money .
In addition , he must deliver 3 &apos; shih as land rent every year ( at the rate of 50 percent ) .
In March last year when the revolution failed , he fled into the hills of Chun @-@ ts &apos;un helping people repair them .
In September he returned home with the arrival of the Red Army in Hsing @-@ kuo when the jackals of the Pacification Corps ran away into the hills .
There was no land distribution then .
In February ( March by solar calendar ) the Red Army attacked Kan @-@ chou and in the same month land was distributed .
Although he did not get any land , he was relieved from the payment of his rent of 3 shih and his debt of 150 yuan .
At the same time he did not get back his mortgage money of 36 yuan .
From February he served for 3 months as chief of land section in the town government assisting in distributing land to the people .
In April he became a company commander of the Red Guards equipped with spears but no guns .
He served for 3 months .
On 15 June he led his unit in one attack against the jackals of the Pacification Corps in Hsing @-@ kuo County .
From June the Red Guards were reorganized into a reserve contingent of the Red Army in which he became a platoon leader .
A month or so later he was made a company commander .
At this time two companies were formed in the 1st township .
In August he led his unit to attack Ch &apos;i @-@ fang and won a victory .
During the march ( in October by solar calendar ) on Hsin @-@ yu he served as a batallion commander .
Because he was unable to leave production and because his meat accounts were not collected so that he could pay back to others , he wanted to go home and did not wish to serve in the Red Army .
He had a schooling of 6 years and can barely read newspapers .
Li Ch &apos;ang @-@ ying
A native of PTang @-@ wu @-@ t * ung in the 1st township of the 10th district .
There were six persons .
He himself , 48 , tills fields .
His wife , also 48 , has aching heart , cooks , washes clothes and feeds pigs .
His son , 20 , tills fields but is stupid and unable to read .
His daughter @-@ in @-@ law , 20 , makes firewood daily but cannot till fields .
His daughter , 12 , was married off in June this year to someone in Wu @-@ wa , 40 li away .
His second son , 3 } died in April this year .
There are only four persons to be fed .
He himself is owner of 30 tan ( piculs ) of rice fields .
From his younger
brother Li Ch &apos;ang @-@ feng he borrowed another field of 20 tan .
Because
Li Ch &apos;ang @-@ feng &apos;s field was of poor quality and did not yield enough to meet
his expenses he went to T &apos;ai @-@ ho and L. ~ k &apos;ang to farm for others .
Li Ch &apos;ang @-@ ying &apos;s own field of 20 tan could yield only 13 tan of rice because
water could not be pumped into it but he had to pay 9 tan of rent .
Li Ch &apos;ang @-@ feng owed a debt of 120 yuan and 9 tan of rice as rent .
He paid
interest on them for Ch &apos;ang @-@ feng .
As for his own 30 @-@ tan field , he could
only reap 17 tan because it was a hilly land situated on a broken cliff .
Coupled with Ch &apos;ang @-@ feng &apos;s actual yield of 4 tan , his total harvest came
to 21 tan .
Besides they were all paddy rice ( rough rice ) which when
converted into dried rice at a 30 percent discount totaled 15 tan , at
best 17 tan in a good harvest year .
Six persons need 40 tan of rice a
year .
Thus there was a shortage of more than one @-@ half which must be made
up by his sweet potato harvest of 30 tan &apos; or so a year .
He fed a pig until December when he sold it for money with which he bought oil and salt for home use .
No meat can be had in ordinary times .
It is bought and served only during festive occasions such as Ch &apos;ing @-@ ming ( Tomb @-@ sweeping festival , 40 cents ) , Shih @-@ t &apos;ien ( Planting crops , 1.5 yuan ) , Tuan @-@ wu ( Dragon boat festival , 30 cents ) , Chifih @-@ hsin ( Eating new rice , 1 yuan ) , Ch &apos;ih @-@ yueh @-@ pan ( the 15th day of the 7th moon , a ghost festival , 20 @-@ 30 cents ) , Chung @-@ ch &apos;iu ( Mid @-@ moon festival , 20 @-@ 30 cents ) , Ke @-@ ho ( Harvesting festival , 2 yuan ) , and Kuo @-@ nien ( New Year festival , 3 yuan ) .
During ChTih @-@ hsin 1 yuan &apos;s worth of meat has to be served because field hands must be hired to plant sweet potatoes .
During Shih @-@ t &apos;ien and Ko @-@ ho helping hands must be hired , totaling 20 man @-@ days a year .
Father and son , apart from working in their own field , must help younger brother Chrang @-@ feng till his 20 @-@ tan field .
This would cost him every year 80 man @-@ days of hired labor ( for each tan of rice a good field needs 3 man @-@ days of hired labor while a poor one , 4 ) .
The death of his younger brother Ch &apos;ang @-@ feng left his wife a widow .
She adopted his ( Ch &apos;ang @-@ ying &apos;s ) second son as her own .
As these 80 man @-@ days of labor cannot be paid for , he has to work his own as well as his sister @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s fields so that there is no time left for him to work for other people .
He owed a debt of 120 yuan to the public granary for which he roust give 7.50 shih of rice as interest ( for each 160 yuan borrowed 1 shih of rice must be paid as interest valued at 2.4 yuan ) .
At the end of each year he sold pigs for 20 or more yuan .
Out of this sum he spent 6 or 7 yuan to buy oil and salt and the balance was paid to the public granary after conversion into rice as interest .
The old and new public granaries of this village each have 30 or more shih of rice totaling 70 shih .
In March this year land was distributed with each of the six persons getting 7 shih totaling 42 shih .
All of Ch &apos;ang @-@ feng &apos;s land was awarded to Ch &apos;ang @-@ ying , Ch &apos;ang @-@ feng &apos;s old debt on which Ch &apos;ang @-@ ying had paid interest was erased .
His own debt of 120 yuan to the public granary was also erased .
The 42 shih of rice field is infertile and can only reap a harvest of 40 percent totaling 25 shih or so .
This coupled with his sweet potato crop is barely sufficient to keep the family fed .
In August this year the authorities of southwest Kiangsi ordered a re @-@ distribution of land on the principle of taking out some fertile land to compensate for the barren .
In his family a son died and a daughter had been married off .
Only four persons are left now and each is given 6 shih 1 t &apos;ung ( 4 t &apos;ung make 1 shih ) .
Some of his barren lands were given to others while he got some fertile ones owned by others .
On this occasion land was divided equally and evenly .
In March each person was awarded 7 tan whereas in August he was only given 6 shih 1 t &apos;ung .
Why ?
The reason is that following the victory of the revolution 1.2 of the P &apos;eng @-@ wu @-@ t Tung peasants who went to T &apos;ai @-@ ho to farm land earlier had come back by this time .
There was then no revolution in T &apos;ai @-@ ho , When they heard about the revolution in Hsing @-@ kuo and its land distribution they all came back .
This is why the people were given less land in this village than in others on a per capita basis .
P &apos;eng @-@ wu @-@ t &apos;ung has only four family surnames of Yi , Li Ch &apos;iu and Cheng , numbering 130 or more people .
It has no village government .
Li Ch &apos;ang @-@ ying did little work in the town government .
His son Li Ch &apos;uan @-@ po was in charge of weapons ( spears , bird guns , swords , etc . ) in the town government .
His son took part in attacks on Hsing @-@ kuo and Liang @-@ k &apos;ou .
He himself participated in attacks on Ch &apos;i @-@ fang and Nanchang .
He is willing to serve in the Red Army but must ask for 1 month &apos;s leave so that he can go home and buy a calf to help till his field .
On 27 June his ox died from a fall .
He bought it 2 years ago for 23 yuan .
After his ox died he sold it for beef and got 10 yuan .
In June he spent 12 yuan to buy another calf but in July it also died from a fall .
He sold it for beef for 8 yuan ( which he had not yet collected ) .
He must buy another calf to help him till his field .
This is why he must ask for 1 month &apos;s home leave before he can come back to serve in the Red Army .
&quot; Thanks to the kindness of the Red Army , &quot; an ox for which one had to pay 70 yuan can now be bought for 20 yuan ^ .
&quot; Thanks to the kindness of the Red Army , &quot; prices on everything are reasonable now .
In the past edible oil cost 23 yuan for 1 tan ( 100 chin ) , now it Is only 10 yuan per tan .
Rice used to cost 4 yuan per shih , now it costs 1 yuan per shin ( 3 coppers can buy 1 sheng of rice ) .
Firewood used to sell for 20 coppers per chin , now it only costs 8 coppers per chin .
Meat which had been sold for 530 coppers per chin before is now sold for 320 coppers per chin .
Only the price of salt and cotton cloth has become very high .
Salt was sold for 320 coppers per chin , now it is 800 coppers per chin .
White cotton cloth used to sell for 140 coppers per ch &apos;ih , now it costs 320 coppers per chi &apos;ih .
Wen Feng @-@ chang
A native of the 4th ( Hou @-@ ching ) township of the 10th district ; it has a population of over 300 and a township government .
There are four persons to feed .
Father , 56 , has aching feet and cannot do any work .
Mother , 46 , cannot see anything or do any work except feeding pigs .
He himself , 22 , tills fields .
In March this year he served as a platoon leader .
In June he became a member of the finance committee in the town government .
In October he set out to attack Nanchang as acting commander of a company of the Red Army reserve detachment .
His wife , 16 , makes firewood , cooks , looks after cattle , but tills no fields .
He himself owned 8 shih of &quot; tTui @-@ chiao @-@ t &apos;ien . &quot; He did not know for how much his father had mortgaged it but he must deliver 2.50 shih of dried rice as rent per year .
His 8 shih is paddy rice field and because it is a good field it can reap 8 shih of dried rice .
Four persons need 28 shih of rice a year , thus short of 20 shih .
He leased a 120 @-@ shih rice field from his landlord who demanded no mortgage money but rent in kind .
As this is all inundated
field , it can only reap 90 shih of paddy rice ( only one harvest a year ) which when converted into dried rice at a discount of 20 percent totals 72 shih .
Out of this he must deliver 55 shih of dried rice as rent in kind ( rent is 75 percent ) , leaving a balance of 17 shih which is not enough to feed the family .
Harvest time is from June to July .
After harvesting crops , paying rent in kind and paying last year &apos;s rent on borrowed new rice , they soon found themselves without anything to eat .
In August and September they had to borrow new rice again from rich peasants .
For every shih of new rice borrowed he had to pay 3 lo ( basket ) .
Every year he must borrow 10 or more shih of new rice .
With regard to the 12 shih of new rice he borrowed last year , &quot; thanks to the kindness of the Red Army , &quot; he does not have to repay them any more .
He owed big landlord Liu Hua @-@ jang a debt of 60 yuan , on which an interest was charged at 1 shih of rice for each 10 yuan due , that debt he does not have to pay back now .
Fortunately he is able to harvest 40 tan of sweet potatoes , 3 tan of which equal 1 tan of rice , so the total would be equivalent to 13 tan of rice .
In March this year , four persons were given a total of 32 shih of rice fields .
After deducting his own 8 shih of &quot; t &apos;ui @-@ chiao @-@ t &apos;ien , &quot; he was actually awarded 24 shih .
The method of distribution was as follows : out of the 128 shih originally tilled by him ( 120 shih leased from landlord , 8 shih tilled by himself ) , 96 shih were shoveled out to others while he kept the remainder of 32 shih .
What had been shoveled out were mostly poor land ; what had been kept were mostly good land .
In August when land was re @-@ distributed , it was found that he had more and better land than he should have , so he had to shovel out 2 shih more and kept the balance of 30 shih .
Some of his good land was shoveled out in exchange for poor land from others .
&quot; Land was fairly distributed by the town government.11
In the past when he tilled his 120 @-@ shih fields , he had to work himself almost to death .
During seasons of rice planting , rice harvesting and sweet potato planting , he had to hire hands to help : rice planting required 6 or 7 man @-@ days of hired labor , rice harvesting 30 or more man @-@ days of hired hands , sweet potato planting another 30 or more ( for early and late crops ) , a total of 70 or more man @-@ days of hired hands .
This did not include exchanges of labor ( that is , you and I help each other with labor ) during rice harvest and sweet potato planting which came to another 10 or more man @-@ days .
Now he only tills 30 shih so he needs no more hired hands or exchanges of labor .
If he used to work 3 times as hard , he now labors one @-@ third as much .
Because he has more time on hand , he manages finances and does some other work in the town government .
When attacks were launched against Hsing @-@ kuo , Liang @-@ k &apos;ou , and now Nanchang , he took part in all of them .
He had a schooling of 4 years , reads half of the posters , and can keep accounts .
Ch &apos;en Chen @-@ shan
A native of the 2d ( Chih @-@ ko @-@ ssu ) township of the 10th district .
The 2d township has 800 people with the town government established at Yung ~ feng @-@ yu .
There are seven persons to be fed : three brothers , three wivesandone daughter of the eldest brother .
The eldest brother , 29 ; ChTen Chen @-@ shan , the second of the three , 24 ; and the youngest brother , 18 .
The eldest set up a street stall in front of another man &apos;s store selling edible oil and salt .
He borrowed 120 yuan as capital , lost it , and &quot; joined the revolution as an expediency . &quot; He did not have to pay his debt but could not operate his street stall anymore .
He is now a soldier in the Red 20th Army .
Ch &apos;en Chen @-@ shan had a schooling of 8 years .
Before 19 he tended cattle at home .
At 19 he started to learn to farm land and worked for 5 years .
He became a propagandist in the Cown government .
During the current inarch he became a company political commissar .
The youngest brother had been a bamboo @-@ splinter apprentice for 3 years .
He is now a soldier in the Red 20th Army .
The eldest brother &apos;s wife cooks , makes firewood and plants vegetables .
His ( Chen @-@ shan &apos;s ) wife joined her in these chores .
She now serves as a unit commander of the Women &apos;s Red Guards .
The wife of the youngest brother is only 9 years old .
The daughter of the eldest brother is 2 .
He owned a rice field of 12 shih .
In addition , he leased another 10 shih to be managed by his elder brother ( a rent in kind of 5 shih must be paid ) .
Embankment work is usually done 1 day out of 3 on the Yung @-@ feng @-@ yu dike .
On such a day his elder brother went out there selling oil and salt and came home later to till his field .
Apart from his own tilling , his elder brother must hire 80 hands to help him every year .
He owed a debt of 130 yuan on which he must pay 10 shih of rice as interest .
He had a harvest of 30 shih of rice a year .
After paying interest of 10 shih on his debt and rent in kind of 5 shih , he had a balance of 15 shih left , Among the seven persons , the youngest brother was away from home working as a bamboo @-@ splinter worker for some other people , so there were six persons consuming 42 shih a year , thus leaving a shortage of 23 shih .
This deficit had to be made up by his elder brother selling oil and salt and by his earning from land farming .
During the period of his apprenticeship , his youngest brother earned no money .
In February last year he and his elder brother joined the revolution .
His elder brother served as chief of the food and grain section of the peasant association while he himself worked as a propagandist .
The wives were all in favor of the revolution because they were frequently hard pressed by their creditors for debt payment and thus unable to observe the New Year .
They were delighted when they heard about resisting payment of rents , taxes , grains and debts .
This is why they were in favor of their husbands joining the ranks of the revolution .
The youngest brother is a simple fellow ; he would do what others have told him .
He did not join the revolution at this
time .
In April when the revolution had failed the jackals of the Pacification Corps came here .
His elder brother fled to Chungr @-@ ts &apos;un where he helped others repair hills .
He himself went to Kuan @-@ ch &apos;ao in T &apos;ai @-@ ho where he made 70 or 80 yuan as a farm helper .
In December last year the Red Array re @-@ took Hsing @-@ kuo .
He and his brother came home and re @-@ joined the revolution .
During the period of failure of the revolution the jackals of the Pacification Corps had burned down six rooms of his house .
In March this year land was distributed .
In addition to his own 20 shih , his family was given 29 shih more , thus totaling 49 shih with each person getting 7 shih .
When the wives witnessed the division of land without having to pay rents and debts they were overjoyed .
So his wife cheerfully went to the town government to serve as a unit commander of the Women &apos;s Red Guards .
In the March distribution they got all good land .
In August when land was divided again , it was evenly exchanged this time between the good and the bad .
They had to give up one @-@ half of the good land and take in one @-@ half of the bad , but the total remained 7 shih per person .
The wives were still delighted because they themselves were government workers and kept telling others that they should even up their land between the good and the bad .
So when it came to even up their own land they were also in favor of it .
All three brothers including himself and his wife have left home to do revolutionary work .
Only three women stayed home : his elder sister @-@ in @-@ law and her daughter , and his youngest sister @-@ in @-@ law , none of whom were able to till fields .
So the two on government sent people to till their fields ; those who were sent had more labor to spare ; they first tilled those of the Ch &apos;en family and then their own ; and the tilling was well done .
The tillers who were sent to till the fields of the Ch &apos;en family eat at the Ch &apos;en &apos;s home .
Because four out of the seven persons eat away from home , each of them saved 7 shih a year .
This is sold for money to buy oil , salt and cotton cloth .
Chung Te @-@ wu
A native of the 3d ( Shan @-@ k &apos;eng ) township of the 10th district .
This family has 11 persons .
He himself , 28 , had a schooling of 7 years , and worked as a bookkeeper in Wang &apos;s grocery store in Pai @-@ lu ( 30 li from Shan @-@ k &apos;eng ) at an annual salary of 60 yuan .
From apprentice to bookkeeper he had worked a total of 13 years .
In March last year he followed the Red Army when it entered Pai @-@ lu and stayed home .
His mother , 57 , is getting old and looks after children .
His elder brother , 31 , tills fields .
His sister @-@ in @-@ law , 32 , cooks , makes firewood , washes clothes , but tills no fields .
He has two nephews , one , 9 , going to school , and the other , 3 .
His wife , 28 , cooks , makes firewood , and feeds pigs .
He has two sons , one , 7 , going to school , and the other , 2 .
His elder nephew is married to a girl of 9 who looks after children .
He also has a niece of 2 .
The above totals 11 persons .
Only his elder brother tills fields while he himself is engaged in business , the rest all lacking productive capability .
He owned 30 shih of rice field and rented another 36 shih totaling 66 shih .
On his leased field he must pay rent in kind at the rate of 60 percent , that is , 21 shih 6 tou ( peck ) which was converted into money so he could keep his rice .
He reaps 40 or more tan of sweet potatoes a year .
The 11 persons need 77 shih of rice a year .
Another 20 or more shih were needed to raise chickens , feed pigs , make wine , hire labor , entertain guests , etc .
Thus he required a total of 120 or more shih a year and was short of over 20 shih on balance .
The whole family needed 150 to 160 yuan a year to pay for salt , cotton cloth , workers1 wages , borrowed rice and entertaining expenses .
Among these items salt cost 20 to 30 yuan , cotton cloth 30 or more yuan , borrowed rice of 25 to 26 shih at 3 yuan per shih totaling over 70 yuan , and entertaining for 20 or more yuan .
The source of this 150 to 160 yuan came from : his salary earned from the store in Pai @-@ lu amounting to 60 yuan plus a bonus of 20 yuan , 10 or more yuan from his miscellaneous crops such as beans , 10 or more yuan from selling surplus pork after feeding themselves , and 10 or more yuan from selling pine firewood , thus totaling about 120 yuan a year .
Every year he owed a debt of 30 to 40 yuan .
His family owed a debt of 200 or more yuan covering all the previous years .
In the past he had owned 46 shih of rice fields .
He sold 7 shih 10 years ago at 10 yuan per shih .
He sold another 9 shih 2 years ago at 12 yuan per shih .
Now he has only 30 shih in all .
Tilling by his elder brother alone was not enough so a hired hand of 120 days was needed every year ; labor cost 240 coppers a day so the total amount of wages came to 28 strings of coppers a year .
In February ( March by solar calendar ) this year following the success of the revolution each person was given 5.50 shih of rice field .
The 11 persons got a total of 60 shih 1 lo ( including 30 shih of his own ) .
Because land in this township had not been evenly divided between the good and the poor , another distribution became necessary but so far it has not been carried out .
There are more people than land in this township .
Each person given 5.50 shih has not enough to live on .
In the past his family needed about 120 shih of rice plus an expenditure of 150 to 160 yuan per year .
As a result of the land distribution they were given 60 shih 1 lo .
This was 6 shih less than what they used to have before the revolution .
However , they need not pay the rent in kind of 21 shih ( converted into 60 or more yuan ) .
Nor do they have to pay the interest of 40 yuan ( at the rate of 20 percent ) on their debt of 200 yuan .
This is the good side .
The bad side is that with the collapse of Wang &apos;s store in Pai @-@ lu he is left without a job .
Thus he has lost his income of 80 yuan a year ( 60 yuan as salary , 20 yuan as bonus ) .
By comparison , the situation is about the same as it was before the revolution .
However , since the revolution living expenses have been greatly reduced .
In making wine some expense of hired labor is still necessary but it is reduced to some extent .
Less cotton cloth is needed because of sparing use .
Although it is still necessary to borrow rice to make up the shortage , the price of rice is greatly reduced to 0.70 yuan per shih .
Entertaining has correspondingly decreased so that miscellaneous expenses which used to require 150 to 160 yuan can now be reduced to about one @-@ half , totaling 80 yuan a year ( in Hsing @-@ kuo money is counted in terms of yuan ) .
In March land distribution &quot; was based on existing Land ownership , taking from those who have more to compensate those who have less . &quot; Each village was used as a unit of land distribution .
Because this village has more people than land , existing land ownership has not been changed .
In the present re @-@ distribution some land was taken from other villages so that everyone could get about 7 shih of rice field .
When this is done , there would probably be enough rice to go around .
In May Chung Te @-@ wu worked in the land section of the town government in charge of distributing forest land ( he was a member of a four @-@ man committee ) and completed its distribution in the 3d township .
The way it is done is by resolution of the town people &apos;s congress after which he sets out to various villages where mass meetings are held and lands actually distributed .
Those who were given more forest land get less on the plains and vice versa .
There were cases in which some got land on the plains but no forest land , but no one got forest land without also getting some land on the plains .
In May he served as a company commander of the Red Guards reserve detachment , In June he became a propagandist of an independent regiment .
During the current inarch to Hsin @-@ yu he again served as a propagandist .
He took part in the 7th and 8th attacks on Chi @-@ an , He is willing to work as a propagandist in the Red Army .
Huang Ta @-@ ch &apos;un
A native of Ch &apos;a @-@ kan @-@ ts &apos;un ( village ) of the 1st township of the 10th district .
This village has 390 or more people .
There are four persons to be fed .
He himself , 36 , makes firecrackers for others .
His mother , 54 , has been sick for 9 years and cannot do any work .
His wife , 31 , chops and carries firewood on a shoulder pole to market in Pai @-@ lu ( Ch &apos;a @-@ kan is 10 li from Pai @-@ lu ) , buys rice with the money she earned , cooks , plants vegetables and washes clothes , working extremely hard .
His younger brother , 32 , is a bamboo @-@ splinter worker .
Since March last year he had gone to serve in the 2d Regiment of the Red Army and was not heard from .
His family owned 5 shih of rice field tilled by himself .
He rented no field from other people .
He makes firecrackers for others as a hired hand earning 0.14 yuan a day .
If he works every day , he can earn 4 yuan a month .
As a bamboo @-@ splinter worker his younger brother makes 0.10 yuan a day , enabling him to smoke yellow tobacco and make some clothes , but has no money to save .
After the revolution he could make no more firecrackers .
His younger brother gave up bamboo @-@ splintering to become a soldier .
In the past he depended on making firecrackers and his wife selling firewood for a living .
They worked hard all year around and still had not enough to
eat .
After land was divided , they had enough to feed themselves .
He owed rich peasant Ch &apos;en a debt of 40 yuan for which he had to mortgage his 5 shih of rice field , This rich peasant was very bad ; he was killed by the masses during the revolution .
In March last year Huang Ta @-@ chrun organized a secret peasant association in ChIa ~ kan @-@ tsfun village .
It had 50 or 60 members and he served as its liaison officer .
In November last year he became a unit commander of the Red Guards .
In April this year he worked as a land clerk ; in June he served as a platoon leader of the Red Army reserve unit ; and in August he was made a company commander of the Red Army reserve unit .
He led his unit in the current march to Hsin @-@ yu ,
In March land was distributed .
Each person was only give 6.50 shih which was all poor land .
Moreover , because the original tiller had already planted seeds in his field , he was entitled to share 60 percent of the harvest while the new owner could only get 40 percent .
In July ( August by solar calendar ) land was distributed again with each person getting .
7.50 shih , of which one @-@ half was good land .
He was a firecracker worker but now is without a job .
His brother used to be a bamboo @-@ splinter worker but is now a soldier .
This entitles them to their land .
Other workers with jobs also got their land in about the same amount as peasants .
The reason for this is that a worker even with a job now has no security and is always fearful of losing it so he wants to have a share of the land .
Moreover , as a worker cannot till his field and must hire someone to till it for him , he wants to get the same amount of land as given to others .
At first , the peasants only allowed the workers to get one @-@ half share of their land , but the workers said that in that case they would raise their .wages.
Then the peasants said : &quot; We will let you have your full share of our land but you will not raise your wages . &quot;
After the workers have got their land , they do not have oxen so they must borrow them from their relatives and friends .
As they do not have plows and hoes , they must borrow them too .
They find it hard ,
He had no schooling and can only keep accounts .
Ch &apos;en Pei @-@ p &apos;ing
A native of the 3d ( Shan @-@ k &apos;eng ) township of the 10th district .
There are 11 persons : three brothers , three wives , two nephews , one father , one mother and one grandmother .
The eldest brother , 38 , is a mason .
The second elder brother , 31 , tills fields .
The youngest , Ch &apos;en Pei @-@ p &apos;ing himself , 24 , had a schooling of 6 and one @-@ half years , studied at a primary school for 1 and one @-@ half years , and taught for 5 years at a countryside primary school .
Father is 65 .
Mother is 62 .
The three wives stay home to cook , chop wood , plant vegetables and wash clothes , but till no fields .
Two nephews are 2 and 3 years old .
Grandmother is 92 .
They owned 32 shih of rice field and leased another 20 shin from others for which they had to pay 10 shih as rent in kind .
Two out of the 11 persons eat away from home ; the elderly and the young eat less .
For this reason they should have enough to eat if they had 60 shih a year .
However , their harvest only totaled 42 shih , thus leaving them with a shortage of about 20 shih a year .
In addition , there were miscellaneous expenses such as that incurred in wine @-@ making , artisan labor , and purchase of oil , salt , cotton cloth , sundry articles , gifts for marriage , funeral and seasonal festivals , etc . , which amounted to 120 yuan or so a year .
The eldest brother earned 50 yuan or so in wages ; his teaching salary came to 50 yuan or so ; and an income of about 20 yuan , accrued from selling coil palm , firewood , bamboo , lumber , etc . , from their hill .
Their cow gives birth to a calf every year , which sells for 20 yuan or so .
All these added to a total of 140 yuan or so which was used to defray miscellaneous expenses and make up their shortage of rice .
He owed a debt of 80 yuan .
Last year his mother , his eldest sister @-@ in @-@ law , and two nephews died , leaving the three brothers , two wives of the two younger brothers , and the mother @-@ in @-@ law of his eldest brother .
There are six persons to be fed .
In March land was distributed on the basis of nine persons ( at that time there were one new @-@ born son , one new @-@ born nephew , and one newly married sister @-@ in @-@ law , but they all died in the latter half of this year ) with each given 5.50 shih totaling 50 shih 5 tou .
This included his own 32 shih ; he was awarded 18 shih 5 tou which was all poor land .
At present , land was being distributed again .
Investigations have been completed but actual re @-@ distribution remains to be carried out .
With the fall of landlords and rich peasants , no more houses were built .
The eldest brother , being jobless , turned to till his field .
Although he could still teach at the newly established village people &apos;s school , he earned only 0.1 yuan a day as food money but no salary , the same as all government workers .
In March he , Ch &apos;en Pei @-@ p &apos;ing , became a political commissar in the standing detachment ; in April he served as a propagandist in the town government ; in May he was chief of cultural section in the town government ; in June he became secretary of the town government ; and in the intercalary month of June he returned home to teach school .
In September he became political commissar of the 2d Company of the Red Army Reserve in the march to Hsin @-@ yu .
The two elder brothers took part in attacks against Wang @-@ t &apos;ang and Lang @-@ ts &apos;un .
Lei Han @-@ hsiang
A native of the 3d ( Shan @-@ k &apos;eng ) township of the 10th district .
There are five persons to be fed : three brothers , one mother and one elder sister @-@ in @-@ law .
The eldest brother , 43 , spent one @-@ third of his time as a hired tiller and two @-@ thirds to till his field .
The second elder brother , 39 , spent two @-@ thirds of his time as a hired tiller and one @-@ third to till his field .
Lei Han @-@ hsiang , 25 , the youngest of the three , worked as an apprentice mason for 2 years , then came home to be a hired tiller .
Mother is 70 .
His eldest sister @-@ in @-@ law , 34 , cooks , makes firewood and plants vegetables .
He owned 7.50 shih of rice field and leased another 44 shih from the public hall on which he must pay rent in kind of 60 percent .
He owed a debt of 120 yuan at an interest rate of 20 percent .
He borrowed it from rich peasant Lei Tsu @-@ yung in the same town .
The two elder brothers worked on odd jobs for others .
When they worked at home , the eldest brother took two @-@ thirds of his time while the youngest only one @-@ third .
He himself spent almost all of his time to do off jobs for others The eldest brother was the head of the household .
His own 7.50 shih of rice field could only reap 6 shih in a year of poor harvest .
The 44 shih of public hall field could reap 70 percent of the harvest totaling 30 shih .
While harvest is reduced , rent cannot be reduced : he must still deliver 26 shih of rice as rent in kind of 60 percent on the 44 shih of the public hall field .
From the latter he had only 4 shih for himself , This coupled with his own 6 shih came to a total of 10 shih .
This was far from enough to feed the family .
Besides he must pay 24 yuan as interest on his debt .
Thus the whole family became extremely impoverished .
This was the way to sustain their livelihood .
First of all , the two elder brothers and especially he himself the youngest of the three were relied on to bring home their wages .
He did about 220 days of odd jobs a year , his eldest brother did 30 or 40 , and his second elder brother did 170 or 180 , thus totaling 420 to 430 days of odd jobs a year .
These odd jobs normally earn 200 coppers a day while reaping crops and picking wood earn 500 coppers a day so that the wages come to a total of 40 yuan a year .
Second , planting sweet potatoes can reap 40 or more tan equivalent to 10 or more shih of rice .
Third , cultivation of late rice crop can yield 10 or more shih on which no payment of rent is required .
However , this makes it impossible to raise coarse crops .
Fourth , raising pigs at the rate of two a year can earn over 20 yuan per pig totaling 40 yuan or more .
If they eat one @-@ half , they still have a balance of 20 or more yuan .
According to the calculation given above , the family had an income of 30 or more shih of rice and a cash of 60 or more yuan a year .
On the side of the outlay , only three persons ate at home ( two of the three brothers ate away from home , only one man and two women eating at home to make a total of three persons ) .
To this was added 24 yuan or 240 mao as payment of interest , thereby leaving a small balance which could be used to buy oil , salt and
other sundry articles .
They should not feel too hard pressed , Why , then was his family still very impoverished ( all year around they simply had nothing good to eat , eating daily sweet potato strings mixed with rice , and nothing good to wear ) ?
The first reason was that all .three brothers were fond of gambling , in which the second brother in particular always had losses .
The second reason was that the eldest sister @-@ in @-@ law was gluttonous and lazy , turned the house upside down , made the three brothers loath to work , and beat the pigs to death .
The third reason was that two oxen died in a row , one died from drinking nitric acid water and the other died from a fall .
His family fortune had turned bad against the times .
For these three reasons , his family always remained impoverished .
In March land was distributed .
Each person was given 6.50 shih totaling 32.50 shih .
That is , out of their originally tilled land of 51.50 shih ( their own 7.50 shih and 44 shih leased from others ) , 19 shih were taken out to be given away to others while they kept the remainder to themselves .
However , the 19 shih which were given away were mostly hill @-@ side barren land reaping only one crop a year while what remained was all good land yielding two crops a year .
Land was to be distributed again .
Investigations had been completed but actual re @-@ distribution remained to be carried out .
In March when land was divided , 19 shih was taken out to be given away to the new owner .
Because this field was then tilled by the new owner , he was entitled to the full share of the harvest of 19 shih .
In dividing land of other families , a part .of the harvest was taken out with the original tiller getting 60 percent and the new owner getting 40 percent .
That is to say , the new owner had nothing to do with the planting of the current crop and left the work of fertilizing and sowing the field to the original tiller .
Accordingly , at harvest time the new owner would let the original tiller take 60 percent &quot; of the harvest while the latter would give 40 percent to the new owner .
This is like the original tiller paying the new owner 40 percent of the harvest as rent in kind .
The eldest brother became a soldier in the Red Guards detachment of this township .
He took part in the attacks against ChiTi @-@ fang and Wang @-@ t &apos;ang , The second eldest brother served as a squad leader of the Red Guards detachment .
He himself at first was a soldier in the Red Guards detachment , later became a platoon leader ; and in the current march to Hsin @-@ yu he was made a company commander .
The Old Land Relationship in This District 1 .
Land Distribution
With regard to land in the 10th district , namely , the area of Yung @-@ feng @-@ yu , the old distribution of land was as follows :
Landlords Kung @-@ t &apos;ang &#91; Public Hall &#93; Rich peasants Middle peasants Poor peasants
40 percent
10 percent ( jointly owned by landlords and rich peasants )
30 percent
15 percent
5 percent
Composition of Population
In general , the composition of population in the 10th district of Hsing @-@ kuo County is as follows :
Landlords Rich peasants Middle peasants Poor peasants Hired peasants Handicraft workers Small merchants Vagabonds
1 percent
5 percent
20 percent
60 percent
1 percent
7 percent
3 percent
2 percent
According to the above description , the real exploiting class ( landlords and rich peasants ) constitutes not more than 6 percent of the population but they hold 80 percent of the land .
Out of this amount rich peasants take up 30 percent and substantial portions of public hall land were under their control .
Thus if the lands of rich peasants were not evenly distributed , it would be difficult to solve the question of land shortage faced by the majority of the people .
Middle peasants comprise 20 percent of the population but they only hold 15 percent of the land .
Because of their insufficient holdings , it is necessary for them to share in the equal distribution of land which will result in an increase and not a decrease of their holdings .
Those who allege that equal distribution would hurt middle peasants are wrong .
In analyzing the composition of population in this district , .the family , not the individual , is used as the unit .
The 1 percent of hired peasants refers to pure and simple hired peasants ; those who are both poor and hired peasants are not included in this category although their number is considerable .
Small merchants refer to full @-@ time small merchants ; those who are part @-@ time peasants and part @-@ time merchants are not included in this category .
The 2 percent of vagabonds refers to the group of people who are totally unemployed and make their living as gamblers and bandits ; those who are partially unemployed are not included in this category ,
Why landlords only constitute 1 percent of the population ?
This is because the majority of the land @-@ holding landlords of this district live in Pai @-@ lu and T &apos;ien @-@ ts &apos;un districts of the neighboring county and in the urban area of this county .
If they were included in this count , the landlord class would generally make up 2 or 3 percent of the population .
Conditions of Exploitation Type 1 : Exploitation by Rent
In the 1st ( Ling @-@ yuan @-@ li ) , 2d ( Yung @-@ feng @-@ yu ) , and 4th ( Hou ~ chin ) townships , land rent is 50 percent .
In the 3d ( Shan @-@ k &apos;eng ) township , it is 60 percent in some areas and 50 percent in a small area .
Because of floods and drought in the 1st , 2d and 4th townships , harvests are frequently poor so rent is lower .
There is neither flood nor drought in the 3d township so rent is higher .
Why are there floods and drought in the 1st , 2d and 4th townships and not in the 3d ?
Because land is mostly poor in the former three townships where the hills are full of shifting sand and devoid of trees .
When the sands from the hills were dashed by clashing water into the river , thereby raising the riverbed higher than the farm land year after year , and when the dike bursts open , the result is flood by inundation .
On the other hand , drought comes when there is no rainfall in a long time .
In the 3d township land is mostly on the hills and higher than the river .
Although land acreage is small , there is no fear of flood in case of rain and no drought in case of a long dry spell .
There is no way to plant trees on shifting sandy hills .
In this district there is only one planting of fields in a year .
Less than 5 percent of the people plant late rice crops .
No rent is collected on small late rice crops and miscellaneous crops .
Type 2 : Exploitation by Usury
Money usury : This can be divided into two periods .
Before 1927 interest on money was 30 percent ( annual interest of 30 yuan on 100 yuan ) .
However , not everyone could get this kind of loan ; he had to mortgage his land , hill or house to get it , Since 1927 &quot; the world has changed , &quot; There were few money lenders .
Very few pure landlords lived in this district .
Most of them lived in the districts of Pai @-@ lu and T &apos;ien @-@ ts &apos;un in Kan @-@ hsien County although their lands were held here .
However , many rich peasants lived here .
For this reason , there was no instance of poor peasants borrowing money from landlords and .
80 percent of their loans were obtained from rich peasants and 20 percent from public hall lands .
Middle peasants did not need loans and hired peasants could not get them .
The only people who needed and could get them were the poor peasants because they had the collaterals .
On the other hand , those who were in the business of lending money were mainly rich peasants .
Thus the struggle between the poor and rich peasants in the land revolution would doubtless be very intense .
Rich peasants sometimes also borrowed money from landlords in amounts of several hundred or 1,000 yuan , at a lower rate of interest ranging from 15 to 18 percent .
The money thus raised by
the rich peasants were in turn lent to peasants in smaller amounts of less than 100 yuan each while they received mortgaged property and squeezed high interest .
In this way the rich peasants acted as the middle man in the exploitation of poor peasants by the landlords .
By the same token , the interests of the rich peasants are inseparable from those of the landlords .
Most of the public hall lands were controlled by the evil gentry of this district .
The majority of this type of local gentry owned some land but not enough to support himself .
He is neither rich peasant nor landlord ; he is evil gentry .
Because he had not enough to eat , he wanted to control the public hall lands to exploit the poor in the process .
In the 1st , 2d and 4th townships , 60 percent of the public hall lands were in the hands of the evil gentry and 40 percent in the hands of the rich peasants .
In the 3d township , most of these lands were controlled by the evil gentry prior to 1912 because at that time only those who were endowed with official rank or academic degree could gain their control .
During the Republican era the rich peasants had controlled most of them .
In contrast with the situation prevailing in the 1st , 2d and 4th districts , 60 percent of the public hall lands in the 3d district were controlled by the rich peasants and 40 percent by the local evil gentry .
When poor peasants borrowed from the public hall , the loan interest was a little chea &apos;per than that charged by rich peasants : the latter charged 24 percent while the former charged 20 percent .
A loan from the public hall required a mortgage as collateral just the same .
Collection of debt was even harsher by the public hall than by the rich peasant .
If interest on the loan was not paid when it became due , the creditor would resort to hauling cattle and pigs and reaping crops from the field .
If the debtor failed to pay the loan interest when due , he could still talk to the rich peasant by agreeing to pay it next year in compound interest or he could sub @-@ lease his mortgaged land to be tilled by someone else and collect the rent to pay his interest .
Since the rich peasant is aimed at making money , he is able to compromise on the term of maturity .
The harshest form of interest on money is interest by the month .
This kind of loan is made to rascals for gambling purposes .
Its term is 1 month ; forlyuan che debtor pays 2 when due .
But this is not often .
Rice usury : Borrowing rice is called &quot; producing rice . &quot; It is borrowed from the rich peasant at very high interest ; if it is borrowed from the public hall or public granary , the interest is lower .
When a rich peasant lends rice to a poor peasant , regardless of whether it was lent in November or December last year , or in January , February or March this year , when he reaps his rice crop in July , he pays the rich peasant a uniform interest rate of 50 percent , that is to say , he must pay 3 lo ( basket ) as interest for 1 tan of rice borrowed .
It was less than 1 year from November when it was borrowed to next July when it was to be repaid ; it was only half a year from January or February to July ; and it was only 4 months from April to July .
Why was such a high rate of interest charged ( 30 percent higher than interest on money loans ) ?
This was because in winter and spring the price of rice was very high , 100 percent higher than in autumn ; if it was
1.50 yuan per shlh in autumn , it would often be 3 yuan per shih in winter and spring .
For this reason , the rich peasant would add interest on the rice he lent in order to compensate for the loss resulting from the lower price of his rice .
He would rather buy rice than lend it .
Even if he had charged an interest rate of 50 percent , it would still be more profitable for him to sell his rice in winter and spring .
So it would be a great favor to the poor peasant if he could get a rice loan from the rich peasant .
Out of 100 shih of rice owned by the rich peasant , more than 90 percent would be sold and less than 10 percent lent .
In ChTa @-@ kan ( 1st township ) when poor peasant Huang Ta @-@ ctt &apos;un wanted to borrow rice from rich peasant Ch &apos;en Feng @-@ ming , he was refused .
However , when Huang asked to borrow money from Ch &apos;en in order to buy rice from him , Ch &apos;en was willing to loan him the money .
Eighty percent of the money loans were borrowed by poor peasants from rich peasants ; only 20 percent of such loans were made by public halls and public granaries ; and no loans were made directly by landlords .
In the case of rice crop loans , poor peasants obtained 90 percent of them from the public halls and public granaries , only 10 percent from the rich peasants .
Thus it can be seen that the rich peasant is an out @-@ and @-@ out exploiter while some sense of compassion is shown by public halls and public granaries .
In the main the public hall is also an exploiter .
In the 1st township , the public halls sold 80 percent of their rice and only lent 20 percent .
In the 2d 3d and 4th townships , practically all of the rice was sold and almost none was for loan .
Only the rice crops owned by the public granaries were totally for loan and none for sale .
In this district every township has its public granaries .
There are four in the 1st township ( population 3,000 ) with a total of 800 shih of rice .
The 2d township ( population 800 ) has five with 500 shih .
The 3d township ( population 3,000 ) has six with 400 shih .
These three townships have a total of 20 public granaries with 1,700 shih of rice .
Practically every village has a public granary .
The 4th township ( population 4,000 ) alone has only one public granary with 100 shih of rice .
In this district the poor peasants relied completely on the public granaries to lend them rice to tide over the lean months ; it was hopeless to borrow rice from the rich peasants .
Although public granaries charged a lower interest of 30 percent than that charged by rich peasants on rice loans , their requirements of pledges for security were quite strict ; iron implements ( plows and hoes ) , pewter @-@ ware , silver ware , cotton blankets , mosquito nets , clothes , etc . , could all be used as pledge .
Only in Yang @-@ fang @-@ tsTun village of the 1st township , however , pledges were not required on rice crop loans by the public granary .
It would do if the borrower could get his neighbor to write a &quot; note of subrogation &quot; guaranteeing the payment of principal and interest .
The rice crops of the public granaries were collected from contributions by landlords , rich peasants and middle peasants .
They collected rice to set up a public granary for the purpose of giving relief to the poor people during periods of famine and starvation .
This was a deceptive reform policy used to pacify the revolt of the people .
Yet those who were ignorant of the truth were
prone to sing the praises of their benevolence and virtue , Except for the landlords , rich peasants and middle peasants who cannot and need not borrow it , rice in the public granary may be borrowed by all poor peasants , hired peasants , workers and vagabonds if they can put up their pledge or get someone to write a &quot; note of subrogation . &quot;
If &quot; producing ( borrowing ) rice &quot; is harsh enough , &quot; picking money on new rice &quot; is even harsher yet .
In the months of February , March , April and May when the poor peasant had nothing to eat , he wanted to pledge his new rice for money from the rich peasant .
During that period the price of rice was usually 3 yuan per shih , but the poor peasant only got 1,50 yuan per shih for his pledged new rice .
When it was time to deliver the new rice in June or July , its price was usually 2 yuan per shih .
Based on the market price of rice at this time , this was not such a terribly harsh deal but the crux of the question lay in the fact that the poor peasant had already delivered his new rice at its lower price and he would just see the rich peasant selling it for a much higher price by next spring and summer .
The rich peasant bought the new rice at 1.50 yuan per shih and he sold it for 3 yuan per shih .
Thus he made a profit of 100 percent which was 50 percent higher than what was made out of &quot; producing rice . &quot; Was not this even harsher yet ?
Pig usury : None in this district .
Cow usury : This practice was in existence in all townships but not prevailing .
The rich peasant lends his cow to the poor peasant .who feeds and works her in the field he gives the rich peasant 1,50 tan ( 3 baskets ) of rice per year as interest ; and if the cow bears a calf , each shares one @-@ half .
In the 1st , 2d and 4th townships , 3 out of 10 rich peasant families lent out their cows in this manner .
In the 3d township , only 1 out of 10 rich peasant families lent out their cows .
As the cow may die of disease or from a fall , this kind of interest is not earned with safety so the rich peasant has not made any effort to deal in it .
He is afraid that the poor peasant might not keep the cow well fed , make her thin , or work her too hard or she might be stolen by thieves .
So if the poor peasant could borrow a cow from the rich peasant , it would be a big favor to him ,
Oil usury : Some poor peasants were engaged in the cultivation of oil @-@ bearing crops .
Between May and June when they ran out of rice , they had to borrow money from the rich peasants to buy rice by pledging to sell new oil .
During these months the price of oil was 25 yuan per tan but they could only get 12 yuan , sometimes even 10 yuan per tan in the deal .
They must deliver the new oil in September without shortage .
In other words , when they borrowed 12 yuan from the rich peasants in June , they pledged to deliver 1 tan of oil in September .
In September the price of oil was always 17 or 18 yuan per tan , sometimes even 20 yuan , the lowest being 15 yuan per tan .
Now suppose they borrowed 12 yuan in June and the price of oil was 18 yuan in September , then the balance of 6 yuan would be counted as interest for 4 months or at an interest rate of 50 percent .
Suppose the price of oil in September was
20 yuan , then the interest would be 8 yuan or at a rate of 80 percent .
The rich peasant collected his oil in September , hoarded it and waited until the following April to August when oil was in short supply , then transported it down river to Chiang @-@ kTou and Kan @-@ chou @-@ fu where it could be sold at least for 25 or 26 yuan per tan , sometimes even as high as 40 yuan per tan .
Two years ago in June peasants of the 1st township went to Pai @-@ lu to buy oil , they paid 1 yuan ( 10 mao ) for only 1 chin ( catty ) 12 liang ( ounce ) .
Although this was retail price but if it was added up it would take 57 yuan to buy 1 tan of oil .
In June last year it took 1 yuan ( 10 mao ) to buy 2.5 chin of oil which was equivalent to 40 yuan per tan .
Calculating on the basis of this example , in June this year if a poor peasant borrowed 12 yuan from the rich peasant for which he pledged to sell 1 tan of his new oil , by June of the following year he would have lost as much as 28 yuan while the rich peasant would have made a profit of more than 200 percent .
This type of usury was not only heavy but also quite safe .
From September to December the poor peasants would engage in oil extraction .
The rich peasant who was not afraid of finding the poor peasant &quot; delinquent &quot; would wait for him to deliver the oil to his home .
Tf he were afraid , he would go to the peasant &apos;s home waiting for the oil to be extracted in order to take the oil home in person .
Such is the type of oil usury .
Speaking from the side of the poor peasant , it is called &quot; picking money on new oil &quot; ; from that of the rich peasant , it is called &quot; lending money on new oil . &quot; The rich peasant seldom lent oil ( not lending money on new oil ) but this was done occasionally .
For example , in December this year the poor peasant borrowed 1 tan of oil from the rich peasant and sold it for 20 yuan .
By next year when the oil price was high , he had to return 1 tan of oil or repay it with money at the market price but without interest .
This would be tantamount to having the poor peasant keep 1 tan of oil for the rich peasant and thus could not be regarded as vicious usury .
A poor peasant could borrow this kind of oil only if he was favored by the rich peasant and could be relied on to repay it by the following year .
The poor peasant borrowed this kind of oil because his parents died , or he was about to get married , or he had other urgent expenses to be met .
Then he would ask the rich peasant with whom he was on friendly terms to lend him the money .
The rich peasant told him that he had no money but he had oil ( or rice ) .
In this way oil or rice was borrowed from the rich peasant to meet the urgent need of the poor peasant .
By the following year when the oil price was high , if the creditor wanted oil , the debtor would have to buy it at the market to make the delivery .
If he wanted money , the debtor would convert his oil into money at the market to make the payment .
This type of borrowing oil is called &quot; hauling oil . &quot;
Pawnshop usury : There are two types of pawnshops : big pawnshops and small ones .
Big pawnshops are not found in this district but in T &apos;ien @-@ ts &apos;un and Pai @-@ lu .
The rate of interest is 5 percent per month .
If you pawn off anything to get 100 coppers , you pay 5 coppers per month as interest ; if you get 1,000 coppers , you pay 50 coppers per month as interest ; if you get 1 yuan , you pay 5 fen per month as interest .
Money is counted in terms of hsiao yang &#91; small yuan &#93; ; the period of maturity is 10 months ; if a pawn is not redeemed when it matures , it is extended for 1 month after which it
becomes irredeemable as dead pawn .
If interest is charged at 5 percent per month , it is 60 percent a year .
This kind of exploitation is extremely harsh .
Many poor peasants , hired peasants , workers and vagabonds go to pawnshops .
Among these four types of people , 60 out of 100 families enter pawnshops .
Pawned articles which were desired included iron implements , pewter @-@ ware , silverware , mosquito nets , blankets and clothing .
Many people in this township went to pawnshops in Pai @-@ lu ; they made up 60 percent of the poor masses .
In Pai @-@ lu the pawnshop owners were natives of Hsing @-@ kuo County .
When pawned articles became irredeemable as dead pawn after 11 months , they were carted off by their owners to Hsing @-@ kuo to be sold at public auction .
If an article was pawned off for 1.50 yuan , it was worth 3 yuan .
However , the aim of the pawnshop owners is to make money on interest and not to auction off pawned articles .
Every township in this district has small pawnshops .
They were run by rich peasants without a store front and not as a regular business .
Whenever poor peasants and workers were really hard up , they carried articles to the homes of rich peasants to be pawned off for a little money .
This happened not too frequently .
Out of 100 families of poor peasants and workers only 10 went to small pawnshops .
Why , then , do more people go to big pawnshops and less to small ones ?
Because small pawnshops were run with a bad reputation .
In addition , local people were known to each other only too well .
When an article was taken in , the poor pawner always wanted to beg for a little more money and the rich peasant found it hard to argue too much about it .
Thus he was rather reluctant to do this sort of business .
Small pawnshops charged the same rate of interest as big ones but the period of maturity was much shorter and determined by the rich peasant to be 1 , 2 , 3 or 4 months beyond which a pawned article became irredeemable as dead pawn .
Of the eight persons who came to the fact @-@ finding meetings at this time , the families of Ch &apos;en Pei @-@ ji &apos;ing , Chung Te @-@ wu , Fu Chi @-@ t &apos;ing and Ch &apos;en Chen @-@ shan had not been to pawnshops at all .
The other four families of Wen Feng @-@ chang , Lei Han @-@ hsiang , Huang Ta @-@ ch &apos;un and Li Ch &apos;ang @-@ ying had all been to pawnshops .
Wen Feng @-@ chang had to go there once a year ; between April and May he had to pawn off something to buy rice .
In April last year , he pawned off one iron hoe and two wine kettles at Heng @-@ hsing Pawnshop in Pai @-@ lu and got 2.40 small yuan with which he bought 1 shih of rice .
In December they were redeemed back by him .
The family of Lei Han @-@ hsiang must pawn every year .
To say nothing of the two elder brothers who were pawners , Lei Han @-@ hsiang , the youngest of the three , pawned off in January last year his unlined long jacket for 1 yuan and two hoes for 6 mao ( 0.60 yuan ) ; neither was redeemed .
In June he pawned off one masons knife for 3 mao and one &quot; yang @-@ t &apos;ou @-@ tzu &quot; for 5 mao ( both were his masonry tools ) ; neither was redeemed .
Up to 2 years ago Li Ch &apos;ang @-@ ying had never been to a pawnshop .
In February last year when the revolution broke out , he went to work in the guerrilla battalion .
When the White bandits came , he fled to Pai @-@ lu .
His wife had nothing to eat at home , so she pawned off her cotton jacket for which she got 1.20 yuan .
When the revolution broke out again , she did not redeem it .
Before last year Huang Ta @-@ cH &apos;un had never been to a pawnshop .
In May last
year when there was no market for firecrackers and nobody wanted to make them , he had nothing to eat so he pawned off one cotton blanket for which he got 1.50 yuan .
This cotton blanket was pawned to rich peasant Chung K &apos;uei @-@ tzu of this village .
In July this year the revolution broke out throughout this county .
When the Red guerrilla detachment arrived in this village from Pai @-@ lu , the poor people rose in revolt , arrested Chung K &apos;uei @-@ tzu and had him killed in Pai @-@ lu , and returned the blanket to him .
The father of Chung K &apos;uei @-@ tzu was a good man willing to give relief to the poor so he was not killed by the masses .
Chung K &apos;uei * -tzu operated a firecracker store in T &apos;ang @-@ chiang and learned to be a skillful fighter .
He could fight off a score of people .
When he was killed , everybody cheered .
His land was distributed and his family fined three times amounting to several hundred yuan ,
Salt usury : This is very harsh because all the salt in Hsing @-@ kuo came from Kwangtung .
Many poor peasants were engaged in salt business as a sideline trade .
Out of 100 poor families , 10 took to carrying salt on their shoulder @-@ pole for sale as a sideline occupation .
As they had no capital , they had to borrow it from rich peasants .
They collected young chickens and carried them to Chia @-@ ying @-@ chou ( Mei @-@ hsien County , Kwangtung Province ) for sale : they went with one pole @-@ load of chickens and came back with one pole @-@ load of salt .
For every yuan borrowed , they had to repay with 1 chin of salt as interest .
Each trip took no more than 20 days or 1 month ; 1 chin of salt was worth 1.20 or 1.30 mao .
In other words , 1 yuan of principal must be repaid with 1.20 or 1.30 mao as interest .
After 1927 as more and more revolutions broke out everyday , interest rate came down to 24 percent so no more money could be made out of interest on salt .
Type 3 : Exploitation by Taxes
In this district there were no direct taxes levied on peasants except taxes and rents on farm lands .
Each 3 shih of rice field is the equivalent of 1 shih of &quot; seedbed field &quot; on which a farm land tax of 4 fen 4 li ( 0.044 tael of silver ) must be paid .
For tax purposes 1 tael of silver is converted into 3.60 big yuan ; 4 fen 4 li into 0.1584 big yuan .
This is the amount of the farm land tax on 1 shih of &quot; seedbed field . &quot; One shih of &quot; seedbed field &quot; equals 3 shih of the existing ordinary field .
Therefore , on 1 shih of ordinary rice field a land tax of 0.0528 big yuan must be paid .
Last year the price of rice in this district was 3 small yuan per shih converted into 6 strings of coppers .
One big yuan is converted into 2.80 strings of coppers ; 0.0528 big yuan is converted into 148 coppers which can buy 2.50 sheng of rice or less .
This is to say that at present 1 shih of rice field in Hsing @-@ kuo must pay a land tax of 2.50 sheng of rice .
However , in this area 1 shih of rice field can only reap 7 tou of rice ( harvest of 70 percent ) .
Thus for every 7 tou of rice a land tax of 2.50 sheng must be paid or 3.50 percent of the harvest .
Although there were no other forms of exploitation than taxes on farm lands , those who traveled to Kwangtung for the salt trade were subjected to various
types of taxes and levies all along the way .
Middle or poor peasants who were engaged in the salt trade collected 70 chin of young chickens in this village at 0.32 yuan per chin .
They shouldered one pole @-@ load of chicken to Chia @-@ ying @-@ chou .
In terms of silver , 1 chin of chicken used to be worth 3 ch &apos;ien ( 0.3 tael of silver ) sometimes 4 ch &apos;ien .
This year the price had gone even higher at 4.8 ch &apos;ien per chin .
Each 7 ch &apos;ien 4 fen of silver is converted into 1 big yuan ; 4 ch &apos;ien 8 fen is converted into 0.65 big yuan or 0.91 small yuan .
After deducting 0.32 yuan as capital , a profit of 0.59 small yuan could be made per chin .
So 70 chin would yield a profit of 41.3 small yuan .
Why is the price of chicken in Chia @-@ ying @-@ chou so high this year ?
Because of the revolution fewer chickens were brought there from various counties in Kiangsi so prices rose sharply .
Out of the gross profit of 41.3 yuan as mentioned above , various items of expenses incurred on the road must be deducted .
The first item was wages .
During prior years it only took 10 days to Chia @-@ ying @-@ chou from here .
But now because the Red sector is separated from the White Sector , it is necessary to make detours in many places , thus requiring at least 15 days to make the trip .
Wage is 0.25 yuan a day so it totals 3.75 yuan for 15 days .
The second item included food , yellow tobacco , tea and strawsandals for a minimum of 0.45 yuan a day totaling 6.75 yuan for 15 days .
The third item covered feed grain for the chickens with 70 chin of them eating 0.30 yuan a day totaling 4.50 yuan for 15 days .
The fourth item was likin tax .
From Hsing @-@ kuo to Meng @-@ ling no levy was made .
At Meng @-@ ling likin must be paid at the rate of 1 big yuan ( converted into 1.40 small yuan ) per tan .
In the past no likin was levied at Meng @-@ ling .
The fifth item included expenses for collecting chickens requiring 3 days of wages , food and buying chicken baskets totaling 2 yuan .
The above four items of expenses came to 19.4 yuan .
Deducting 19.4 yuan from the gross profit of 41.3 yuan , the net profit per tan of chicken is 21.9 yuan .
Going with 1 pole @-@ load of chicken and coming back with 1 pole @-@ load of salt .
This year 1 yuan can buy 18 chin of salt in Chia @-@ ying @-@ chou ; in the past it could only buy 14 chin ; even last year that was so .
Price is counted in big yuan .
This year the development of the revolution has slowed down the market for salt and thus brought down its price to a reasonable level .
Carrying 1 pole @-@ load of salt at a cost of 4.50 big yuan ( converted into 6.30 small yuan ) , the salt trader brought it to Hsing @-@ kuo where there was a severe shortage of salt between May and June this year .
Thus the price rose sharply , and 1 small yuan could only buy 2.50 chin .
Based on this price , 80 chin of salt could be sold for 32 small yuan and after deducting the cost of 6.30 yuan a gross profit of 25.70 small yuan could be made .
However , from the above gross profit of 25.70 yuan must be deducted expenses on the road .
First , wages came to 3.75 yuan for 15 days .
Second were food , yellow tobacco , drinking tea and straw sandals totaling 6.75 yuan .
Third was likin tax .
There were six places : Chi @-@ t &apos;an , Meng @-@ ling , Pai @-@ fou , Tiao @-@ yu @-@ t &apos;an , Hui @-@ ch &apos;ang and Hua @-@ ch &apos;iao .
In Meng &apos;ling alone likin tax must be paid .
In the other five places , a ticket inspection was required .
Formerly payment of likin tax was 0.60 or 0.70 yuan per tan , now it is
1 yuan per tan .
Ticket inspection in five places cost 0.20 small yuan each totaling 2 big yuan ( converted into 2.80 small yuan ) .
The above three items of expenses came to 13.30 yuan .
Deducting this from the gross profit of 25.70 yuan leaves a net profit of 12.40 yuan .
One pole @-@ load of chicken on the going trip would make 21.90 yuan , and 1 pole @-@ load of salt on the return trip would make 12.40 yuan so the total profit came to 34.30 yuan .
The period of time was 1 month .
In the past the profit in chicken and salt had not been as great as it is now , but it was more dependable and did not require making detours .
A roundtrip would only take 20 days .
At present , although greater profit can be earned , the road is not safe for travelers .
Local posse and elements of the Pacification Corps frequently searched and robbed travelers of their money ( only a small amount of money from selling chickens was used to buy salt with the greater portion being carried on their person ) .
They did not want salt but they often grabbed chickens for food ; and the only thing they did not do was kill people .
Nevertheless , the number of such traders have not decreased .
In May and June the price of salt was high at 1 yuan for 2.50 chin .
Now ( in October ) it has become cheaper at 1 yuan for 3 chin .
12 liang .
This is because the breakthrough at Chiang @-@ kTou and Ta @-@ hu @-@ k &apos;ou has facilitated the transport of salt from Kan @-@ chfou to this area .
Compared with the pre @-@ revolution period the price is still very high .
Before the revolution 1 yuan could buy 6 chin 4 liang of salt .
It was cheaper almost by 100 percent compared with the present ( in October ) .
It was cheaper almost by 200 percent compared with May and June this year .
The Classes in the Struggle 1 .
Landlords
The landlords of the first township all lived in Hsing @-@ kuo City or Pai @-@ lu , not in the township itself .
The rents were delivered to Hsing @-@ kuo City or Pai @-@ lu .
Four or five landlords resided in Pai @-@ lu , each collecting over 1,000 tan of rice as rent .
Some operated stores in Pai @-@ lu ; others worked in Nan @-@ ch &apos;ang or Kan @-@ chou .
One lived in Hsing @-@ kuo City ; collected 1,000 tan as rent ; operated the Heng @-@ ch &apos;un @-@ hao imported goods store in the city and a store in Kan @-@ chou .

His farm was divided .
He now works In the government as a propagandist .
Hsieh Wen @-@ lin , with 30 members in the family , farmed 500 ku of land ; collected 100 tan as rent ; is related to Tu Hsi @-@ yu ; voluntarily burned his deed and divided the land ; now serves as chief of the finance section in the government .
Of the six brothers in his family , .five farmed ; hired four employees ; was the richest in the township , no one literate in the family ; very honest .
( Hsieh Wen @-@ lin was actually a rich peasant . )
The third township had two landlords .
Tseng Hsi @-@ ch &apos;un &apos;s family was divided into five households , totaling over 20 members ; collected over 1,000 tan of rice as rent ; did not farm themselves ; well @-@ known big landlord ; counterrevolutionary .
All the men fled , leaving behind five or six women and children .
Each was allocated land .

He was arrested by the third district and delivered to the government for detention ; not yet killed ; his assets were confiscated .
Rich Peasants

Of the nine rich peasants in the third township , six were counterrevolutionary , and only three not yet counterrevolutionary .
Fourth township : two rich peasants : Liu Chia @-@ hung and Tseng Mei @-@ hsi , both counterrevolutionary .
( See section on landlords )
Of the four townships in this district , 9 out of the 12 rich peasants in the first , 7 out of the 9 in the second , 6 out of the 9 in the third , and the 2 in the fourth were counterrevolutionary .
The four townships had a total of 32 rich peasants , and 24 of them were counterrevolutionary .
Though the remaining eight are currently not counterrevolutionary , what will happen in the future is unknown .
The farms of the rich peasants were very good , just as good as those belonging to the landlords and the courts &#91; kung @-@ t &apos;ang 0361 1016 &#93; .
When they bought land from the poor peasants , they always wanted to buy the good farms , and the poor peasants had to sell .
If the poor peasants sold the poor farms , it would take several mou to make up the price of 1 mou of good land .
When the rich peasants loaned money to the poor peasants , they always asked for the good farms as security .
Therefore , the good farms gradually were concentrated in the hands of the rich peasants .
When the revolution first started , such as the second or third month this year , many of the rich peasants became opportunists and joined the revolution .
The rich peasants and their henchmen occupied 30 percent of the posts in the township and district Soviets .
During the anti @-@ rich peasant propaganda week in the 4th and 5th months , they were thrown out .
Currently , only two rich peasants serve in the district ( Hsieh Wen @-@ lin serves as finance section chief in the second township ; Tsou Li @-@ tung serves as cultural department chief in the district government . )
Middle Peasants
The middle peasants benefited in the land revolution .
First , not only suffering no loss in land , most of them gained in the land division .
The middle peasant population of this district constituted 20 percent of the total , while their land was only 15 percent .
Therefore , most of them acquired additional land .
Though some of them had their land reduced , it was a very small minority .
Second , in the past , it cost around 200 yuan to get a wife , almost equivalent to the entire family assets of a middle peasant .
Therefore , it was difficult for a middle peasant to marry , and many of them were in debt due to marrying .
If the wife died , it would be extremely difficult to marry again .
Now , there is freedom of marriage , costing not 1 penny .
This is a great advantage .
Third , in the past , when an aged member died in a middle peasant family , the funeral would cost at least 50 yuan , or as much as 100 , or more .
In the past , very often a middle peasant became indebted or bankrupt due to the death of a parent .
Today , superstitious habits have been abolished .
If someone dies , it only requires burial , without wasting any money .
Fourth , in the past , when the family cow died , the middle peasant would sell the beef for 8 or 10 yuan .
He must then add 10 yuan or more to buy another cow .
Now , thpugh he will only get 8 or 10 yuan for a dead cow , he only has to put up 3 or 4 yuan to buy another one .
Fifth , now that the power of the landlords and rich peasants has been knocked down , the rites abolished , and superstition abolished , it is no longer necessary to give gifts or burn incense , and some expenses are saved .
Sixth , besides the above five economic advantages , there is also the political advantage , which is the major one .
In the past , under the control of the landlords and rich peasants , the middle peasants had no &quot; right to speak , &quot; and must abide by the decisions of others .
Now , together with the poor peasants and hired help , they have the right to speak .
Approximately 40 percent of the middle peasants have responsibilities in the township and district Soviets .
Among the middle peasants , those owing no debt at all constituted 10 percent , and those owing a little debt but still able to manage the household 30 percent .
The middle peasants were very brave in the revolution .
Same as the poor peasants , they &quot; sallied forth &quot; ( assigned to the Self @-@ Defense Army , at times they had to sally forth to do battle ) , performed patrol duty and held meetings .
In regard to the middle peasants of the district , their population constituted 20 percent of the total , and their land 15 percent .
Though their land was of better quality than that of the poor peasants , it was far inferior to that of the rich peasants .
Generally speaking , it was good and badhalf and half .
Poor Peasants
After the revolution , the poor peasants gained the following advantages :
( 1 ) Land was allocated to them .
This is their fundamental interest .
( 2 ) Hills were allocated to them .
In the past , the poor peasants rarely owned any hills .
Among the poor peasants of the first and second townships , 30 households had hills , and 70 had none .
As there are many hills in Chin @-@ chun Village ( Shan @-@ k &apos;eng ) in the third township , 70 poor peasants had hills , while 30 had none .
The hills there are mostly oil @-@ producing hills .
Of the 100 poor peasants in the fourth township , half of them had hills and half had none .
Among the poor peasants in the townships having hills , the area per household was very small .
As the hills in the first and second townships are mostly sandy , the landlords only wanted farms , not hills .
The rich , middle and poor peasants each owned a part of the hills .
The distribution in the first township was : 40 percent owned by the rich peasants ; 40 percent by the middle peasants ; 20 percent by the poor peasants .
The distribution in the second township was : 50 percent owned by the rich peasants ; 30 percent by the middle peasants ; 20 percent by the poor peasants .
As there are more oil @-@ producing hills in the third township , which are more productive , the landlords wanted them , but it was still the rich peasants who owned most of the hills .
The distribution was : 15 percent owned by the landlords ; 50 percent by the rich peasants ; 20 percent by the middle peasants ; 15 percent by the poor peasants .
It was stated before that 70 poor peasant households in the third township had hills , but what they owned constituted less than 20 percent of the total , each household owning only a very small area .
The distribution in the fourth township was : 20 percent owned by the landlords ; 20 percent by the rich peasants ; 50 percent by the middle peasants ; 10 percent by the poor peasants .
Owning little or no hills
was a big difficulty of th &amp; poor peasants .
First , they had little or no firewood , and had to gather straw from hills belonging to others .
Second , they could not chop firewood to exchange it for oil and salt at the market ; they could only gather straw in exchange for oil and salt , and it took three loads of straw to make up for one load of firewood .
Third , they had no lumber to build houses Or make tools .
Fourthj owning none or little oil @-@ producing hills resulted in having little or no oil for food .
Now that the hills have been divided , according to the number of people in the household similar to the division of land , every household owns hills .
Though the number of hills in the various townships varies and the people in some have more while others have less , everyone has a little even in the townships which have less hills and the difficulties of the poor peasants are solved .
Because of the need , the poor peasants firmly advocated the division of hills .
For the sake of production , the hills had to be divided .
In the past , due to the lack of manpower , those households with more hills left some of them untended , while the large masses of poor peasants with adequate manpower had to remain idle .
Now that the hills have been divided , the poor peasants can devote their effort to their own hills , and production will greatly increase .
( 3 ) At the beginning of the revolution , the grain belonging to the landlords and counterrevolutionary rich peasants was divided , and the poor peasants had their shares free of charge .
The grain in Pai @-@ lu ( where the big landlords concentrated ) was evenly divided among the people , and the poor peasants did not finish eating it even at harvest time .
( 4 ) Debts incurred prior to the revolution did not have to be repaid .
When the revolution first started in the third month , the higher authorities instructed that debts owed to merchants , to collective funds and among the poor workers and peasants themselves must be repaid .
In the middle part of the 6th month ( July by Western calendar ) , an official communication came from Southwest Kiangsi ( the Southwest Kiangsi soviet ) instructing that all debts were cancelled .
Actually , since the third month , no debt was paid , which was a fact , but the three kinds of debts described above still had to be paid , according to principle ( a theory ) .
After the 6th month , even that principle was abolished .
The poor peasants fully supported the move .
Why did they want to cancel even the three kinds of debts ?
First , in regard to debts owed to merchants , most of the big merchants had fled .
( Ten big merchants among the 35 stores in Pai @-@ lu had fled . ) As for the small merchants ( such as the 25 small stores in Pai @-@ lu ) , though the workers and peasants owed them money for goods , most of them were in debt to the big merchants , landlords and rich peasants .
If the poor workers and peasants did not repay them , nor did they have to repay the landlords and rich peasants .
When the two were compared , it was still advantageous to the small merchants , because they owed more to the big merchants , landlords and rich peasants than what the poor workers and peasants owed them .
Second , in regard to collective fund debts , which were incurred for the purpose of marrying or paying debts , the poor workers and peasants asked their relatives and friends to set up a fund and borrowed from it .
Sucb
relatives and friends were either middle or rich peasants , and cancelling the debt did not hurt them .
Though such funds were set up to render friendly aid , it was the poor peasants who borrowed from them and , as the poor peasants could not pay , it was proper to cancel the debts .
Even if the second and third funds were borrowed by the rich peasants , it was also reasonable to cancel them , because the rich peasants , after borrowing the money , loaned it out to other poor peasants for interest , and now the poor peasants did not have to pay them back .
Furthermore , the entire assets of the rich peasants were either confiscated or donated , and there was nothing left .
Therefore , it was proper to cancel the debt .
As for the funds borrowed by the landlords and rich peasants for the purpose of exploiting the poor workers and peasants , there was no such incident in this district .
Third , in regard to the mutual debts among the poor workers and peasants , &quot; as you are poor , and I am also poor , how do I pay you ? &quot; Thus , the question was answered .
Therefore , it was most proper to cancel all debts .
( 5 ) They enjoyed inexpensive rice .
In the 1st and 2d months this year , the cost of grain was 4.60 yuan per tan .
The revolution started in the 3d month , and it dropped to 2 yuan per tan .
From the 6th month to now ( 9th month lunar calendar ) , it was .70 yuan per tan .
By comparing .70 yuan with 4.60 yuan , it was 6.5 times cheaper .
When the grain was cheap , naturally it was unfavorable to the poor peasants who had received land allocations and cultivated and harvested , but it was favorable to them during the several months after the beginning of the revolution and prior to harvesting .
( 6 ) Greater freedom to get a wife .
( The peasants of Kiangsi turned the term &quot; freedom to marry &quot; into a verb , to distinguish it from the coerced and mercenary marriages of the old days ; the term is commonly used among the peasants in the entire soviet area . ) In the past , one must have money to get a wife ; therefore , many poor peasants could not get married .
Or , even if they did , it was either a child bride or someone very advanced in years .
Should the wife die , it was most difficult to remarry .
Now , such difficulties no longer exist .
( 7 ) It is no longer necessary to spend money when there is a death in the family .
All one has to do is to bury the dead .
( 8 ) The cost of cows is cheap .
It is easy to buy or replace a cow .
The poor peasants are very short of draft animals .
Take 100 poor peasant households in the district : only 15 have 1 cow per household , 40 have 1 cow per 2 households , 10 have 1 cow per 3 households , 5 have 1 cow per 4 households and 30 have none .
Under this situation , the cheap cost of cows is favorable to the poor peasants .
( 9 ) Social obligations are abolished and superstition eliminated , and the expenses for them are no longer necessary .
( 10 ) There is no longer opium smoking or gambling , or theft .
Even if the door is not closed at night , nothing is stolen .
( 11 ) With the division of land , every household can raise hogs .
Not just to sell them for others to eat , but the poor peasants can eat the meat themselves .
In the past , very few poor peasants bought meat from the butcher shops , but now more of them are buying meat .
( 12 ) This is the most important point : The acquisition of political power .
The poor peasants are the main force of the rural political power and the leading class of the village .
The poor peasants can be divided into five strata according to the number of cattle as discussed in item ( 8 ) above .
Hired Help
Similar to the poor peasants , the hired help also received land allocations , because , as the landlords and rich peasants have been overthrown , no one will hire permanent help though temporary help is still needed .
Though they now have the land allocated to them , they do not have draft animals or farm tools , and it is difficult for them to farm the land .
This problem is not yet solved .
Instead of allocating the animals and farm tools confiscated from the landlords and rich peasants to the hired help , the district and township governments sold them ,
Fu Chi @-@ t &apos;ing &apos;s nephew , Chu Ta @-@ hsi , was hired help .
He has three brothers , two parents and a wife ( a grown up child bride ) .
He is the eldest , age 22 , and the boy next to him is 19 years old .
He worked as permanent help for rich peasant Chung , at an annual wage of 39 yuan , small currency .
His 19 @-@ year @-@ old brother was a cowherd , earning an annual wage of 10 yuan .
Their total income of 49 yuan was enough to buy- 16 tan of grain , sufficient for 2 and a half persons .
They relied on their mother and his wife to gather and sell straw for food , eating two meals in winter time .
He owed over 30 yuan ; had no house of his own ; lived in a mountain shed belonging to a landlord and took care of the latter &apos;s hills .
His father , now over 60 years of age , had also worked as hired help .
The hired help in this district could draw 15 pays per year , reporting for work after the 15th day of the 1st month of the year ; no customary meals of meat on the 1st and 15th days of the 1st month ; bedding supplied by the boss , but no clothes ; paying for their own medicine ; no wage deduction due to illness of less than 3 days , but wages were deducted beyond 3 days .
Their wages were paid piecemeal .
They worked from dawn to dark .
Besides the time spent on meals and rest , they worked at least 10 hours a day .
In winter time , they peeled mu @-@ tzu &#91; 2606 1311 &#93; and potatoes.in the evenings .
Ninety @-@ nine percent of the hired help had no wives .
They were the most miserable class in the rural village .
Not only did all landlords and rich peasants have wives , but some of them had several .
Ninety percent of the middle peasants had wives and 10 percent did not .
Seventy percent of the poor peasants had wives and 30 percent did not .
Seventy percent of the
handicraft workers had wives and 30 percent did not .
Ten percent of the vagrants had wives and 90 percent did not .
Even the vagrants were better off than the hired help , as 99 percent of the latter had no wife .
In the 7th month ( 8th month lunar calendar ) &#91; sic &#93; , the government issued an order that the unmarried men and women must get married as soon as possible by free choice .
Thus , the number of marriages by the free choice of the parties suddenly rose .
In the 2 months since the 7th month , most of the formerly unmarried middle and poor peasants have been married , and there are very few single men or women .
It is more difficult for the hired help .
The women object to the lack of utensils and articles for use in the hired help &apos;s home and his long absences .
Therefore , it is difficult for the hired help to solve the wife problem .
In Yang @-@ fang Village in the first township where Fu Chi @-@ tTing lives , of the four hired help ( two sets of brothers belonging to two families ) , only one acquired a wife by free choice .
Actually , another one could have acquired a wife also , but the social security section chief of the township government refused to register them on ground of their illicit relationship in the past .
As a result , the woman married someone else , and the man is still single .
In the vicinity of Yung @-@ feng Market in the second township , four of the six hired help acquired wives by free choice .
In Hou @-@ ching Village in the fourth township where Wen Feng @-@ chang resides , the one and only hired help is still single .
After land division , there is no longer any permanent help , and only 30 percent of part @-@ time help is left .
Wages have not gone up , nor have the hired help asked for a raise .
&quot; There is not even any work , let alone a raise ! &quot;
Now we discuss the issue of draft animals and farm tools after the hired help acquired land , Of the two hired help in Yang @-@ fang Village , the Ch &apos;en family has two brothers , both working as hired help .
The elder brother was a permanent employee of rich peasant Ch &apos;en , earning 33 yuan a year .
The younger brother worked for rich peasant Chung as a permanent employee , earning 42 yuan .
Their father , deceased , was a tenant fanner .
Their mother took them around begging after their father died .
Grown up , they became hired help .
Their mother died .
The older brother is now 29 and the younger 23 .
They have a house and cooking utensils , but no furniture .
The farm tools of the past were sold .
After land was allocated to them in the 2d month , both brothers returned home .
The younger one acquired a wife by free choice .
They had no capital .
The younger brother once had over 100 yuan , but he lent it to poor peasant Cbung , He could not collect it as all debts were cancelled , and the poor peasant debtor had no way to repay him anyway .
Luckily , their uncle , a middle peasant , loaned them a draft animal and tools .
The three of them were allocated a total of 16.2 shin of farmland .
After receiving land allocation in the 2d month , they immediately farmed the land and kept the entire harvest .
Harvesting the first crop , they cultivated a second .one , which is growing well * With a cow , one person can farm 100 ku of land , yet the two brothers together only cultivate over 10 ku .
Therefore , they have much spare time , and they do odd jobs for others , work as porters , and earn some money .
The Chung family of Yang @-@ fang Village also consists of two brothers .
Their parents were deceased .
They live with their uncle ( Chung En @-@ chiang ) , uncle &apos;s wife , their two sons , a daughter @-@ in @-@ law , and two granddaughters , totaling nine members in the family .
The uncle and his two sons were tenant farmers .
They owed money and could not make enough to live on .
The two brothers worked as hired help .
The older brother , Chung Sheng @-@ p &apos;o , in his 40 &apos;s , worked for rich peasant Chung as a permanent help .
The younger brother , Chung Sheng @-@ huai , age 36 , worked for middle peasant Chung , also as a permanent help .
After land division in the 2d month , they farmed their own land .
Formerly they leased a cow from middle peasant Chung Lung @-@ t &apos;an , and the cow threw two calves .
After the revolution , Chung Lung @-@ t &apos;an wanted to collect one of the calves .
The township government told him : &quot; We must wait and see how the other townships handle such matters .
Only if they permit the original owners to do so will you be able to collect a calf .
At present you cannot do so . &quot; Therefore , the cattle still remained with Chung En @-@ chiang .
After the two brothers received land allocations , draft animals and tools were no problem , because their uncle had them .
Here we will discuss middle peasant Chung Lung @-@ t &apos;an .
He is in his 30 &apos;s , his mother in her 60 &apos;s , and his wife in her 20 &apos;s , a total of three mouths to feed .
He owned over 10 ku of land and leased 30 or 40 from others .
After paying the rent , he had more than enough for the family , and he sold the surplus .
He leased three cows to three poor peasants , collecting 1.5 tan of grain per cow per year as rent .
The calves were divided half and half .
He had money to loan out .
In the land division in the 2d month , his family of three received a total of 24 ku of land ( 6 tan per person ) &#91; sic &#93; , which was more than what he owned before , but he was not permitted to lease land from others .
Therefore , he had no surplus grain to sell .
The cows leased out by him and the money loaned out were all cancelled and gone .
He is very honest .
He does not oppose the revolution , but nor has he undertaken any important work .
He now works as a cook in the Red Army reserve in his home village .
The hired help have not gained political power after the revolution .
The middle and poor peasants always find them &quot; illiterate , inarticulate , unenlightened , ignorant of official affairs , &quot; and incapable .
No hired help is among the committee members of the district and township governments , and only one serves as a .
team leader of the township Red Guards .
Handicraft Workers
Handicraft workers in the district included carpenters , masons , tailors , iron workers , barbers , bamboo workers , mill workers , coir workers , stone workers , painters , tin workers , weavers , silversmiths , dye workers , trough workers , lacquer workers , kiln workers , and paper workers , a total of 18 categories .
Carpenters , masons , tailors and bamboo workers were more numerous ; barbers , iron workers and trough workers ( fetching oil ) next ; and the remaining.categories the least in number .
The district did
not have coppersmiths , cotton ginners , shoemakers or tanners .
The first township had one oil trough ; the second , two ; the third , 11 , and the fourth , 12 , each trough attended by one trough worker .
The wages per man @-@ day of labor in the past were : carpenter 0.20 yuan , mason 0.20 yuan , tailor 0.15 yuan and bamboo worker 0.15 yuan .
The barbers in the first , second and fourth townships received 1 peck of grain per year per person , in the third township they were paid 0.15 yuan per year per person , and all meals were provided free by the boss .
Iron workers were paid 0.25 yuan .
In regard to trough workers , they are paid 10 coppers for each catty of oil produced in the second township , 3 coppers each catty in the third , and 2 catties of oil for each picul ( 100 catties ) produced in the fourth .
The situation in the first township , which produced less oil , was not clear .
The oil in the third township was the cheapest because of the large output .
In regard to mill workers , each mill was 0.60 yuan , requiring 3 man @-@ days of labor .
Coir workers were paid 0.22 yuan , and stone workers 0.45 yuan .
Painters were paid according to the pictures .
They painted the portraits of rich gentry and landlords and images of gods .
Tin workers were paid according to the tin utensils .
Weavers were paid 0.10 yuan for every 10 feet of summer or spring cloth .
( Summer cloth is hempen fabric ; spring cloth consists of 80 percent hemp and 20 percent cotton . ) The district had no cotton textile weaver .
Silversmiths were paid according to the silver utensils , &quot; suffering a big disadvantage . &quot; The situation of the dye workers was unknown ..
Lacquer workers were paid by the piece , and so were the kiln workers .
Paper workers were paid 0.15 yuan ( making durable paper from mulberry bark , only in the third township ) .
In the past , carpenters , masons , tailors and bamboo workers performed from over 100 man @-@ days of work to 200 per year .
After the revolution , the work days of the masons and tailors have been greatly reduced , amounting to only about several dozen man @-@ days per year .
Carpenters and bamboo workers are doing a little less work than before , but not noticeably so .
Barbering is more popular than before , because the women have all cut their hair .
After the revolution , tin workers , painters , lacquer workers , and paper workers have all disappeared , because there is &apos;no more need for them .
( Paper workers made fuses for firecrackers used in celebrations .
Now that such firecrackers are not used , there is no longer need for paper workers . )
The &quot; order from above &quot; provided that handicraft workers would receive a half @-@ share of land , but the handicraft workers demanded a full share , on ground that they were either unemployed or their work was reduced and insecure , and that only by getting land would they have security .
The peasants said : &quot; The order from above provides that you get half a share . &quot; The workers said : &quot; If so , then wages will have to be raised . &quot; The peasants did not want the wages to increase , because the poor peasants and hired help needed to employ the workers to make farm tools to farm their land .
The rich and middle peasants already owned farm tools ; therefore , they had no need to employ the workers .
Only the poor peasants had such need ; therefore , they opposed higher wages .
The poor peasants said : : &quot; Alright , you can have the land , but you must not raise the wages . &quot; The workers said that , after receiving their land allocations , if they still performed 100 man @-@ days of work a year , they would be willing to give 2 tan of grain
to the public .
The barbers were not allocated land , because they stayed with others all day long and had their meals free .
The workers of Kan @-@ hsien received land and had their wages decreased .
The wage of masons was reduced from 0.20 yuan to 0.15 , and that of bamboo workers from 0.15 yuan to 0.12 .
Seventy percent of the handicraft workers had wives , and 30 percent did not .
After the revolution , most of the single men acquired wives by free choice .
As the handicraft workers have a wide contact , possess a special skill and are relatively intelligent and articulate , and many among them are literate , they are in a better position than the hired help .
The handicraft workers have a general labor union in the district , branch unions in the townships and branch departments in the villages .
The 20 or more workers of various occupations in Ling @-@ yuan in the first township , for instance , have organized a branch union .
Rural handicraft workers always farmed on the side while pursuing their major occupation of handicraft .
There were very few of them who did not farm at allless than 10 in 100 .
Eighty percent of the handicraft workers were in debt .
Merchants
Merchants in the district operated grocery and variety goods stores , rice and fruit stores ( further divided into several dozen categories ) , tea shops , restaurants , butcher shops , beancake shops and opium dens .
Those who operated small stores exclusively without farming on the side constituted 3 percent of the population ( three families in 100 ) .
Among the four townships in the district , there were , in the past , only three small merchants with 500 yuan in capital , all located in Yung @-@ feng Market , and none in other townships .
The small stores in the district were distributed as follows : five in the first township , 35 in the second ( all in Yung @-@ feng Market ) , six in the third and none in the fourth , totaling 46 .
Out of the 46 small stores , four had capital of 500 yuan .
( Three of them were in Yung @-@ feng Market : A medicine store , owned by someone from Chang @-@ shu , and two imported goods stores , branches from Hsing @-@ kuo City .
None of the owners was a landlord in the district .
They all fled when the revolution started .
The stores were seized and the goods given to the poor .
The fourth store was in Shan @-@ k &apos;eng , owned by a landlord of the township .
The whole family fled , and the store was boarded up . ) One store had a capital of 400 yuan .
( Located in Shan @-@ k &apos;eng , it was a variety goods store , operated by two partners , Han Li @-@ t &apos;ao , who farmed 20 shih of land , and Han Li @-@ tung , who farmed 60 shih .
After the revolution , Han Li @-@ tfao fled .
Han Li @-@ tung infiltrated the revolution , served as the land section chief in the government , and was accused of belonging to the AB League and detained by the district government . ) Three stores had capital of 300 yuan .
( All were located in Yung @-@ feng Market : two were variety goods and fabrics stores , operated by individuals from Hsing @-@ kuo City .
Both were counterrevolutionary , and both fled .
The stores were converted into tea shops .
One was
a butcher shop .
The owner also had 60 ku of land .
He joined the revolution ; continues in business ; serves as chairman of the village government ; is honest ) Two stores had capital of 100 yuan .
( One was in Shan @-@ k &apos;eng , selling variety goods and serving also as an inn .
The owner had no land ; counterrevolutionary ; was killed ; the store closed .
The other is in Hsi @-@ chiang , selling variety goods and also making silverware .
The owner farms several ku of land ; not counterrevolutionary ; store still in business ) .
Two stores had capital of 50 yuan .
( Located in the third township , the one in Chu @-@ k &apos;eng is a medicine store .
The owner has 20 ku of land ; not counterrevolutionary ; store still in business .
The other , located in Shang @-@ ching @-@ yao , was also a medicine store .
The owner had land ; counterrevolutionary ; fled ; the store closed . ) There were 24 stores with capital of 20 yuan .
( Two in Wu @-@ niang @-@ miao and two in Chiao @-@ tfien @-@ chiang , totaling four in the first township ; 20 in Yung @-@ feng Market in the second township . ) There were 10 stores with capital of 10 yuan .
( Nine in Yung @-@ feng Market in the second township ; one in Chifi @-@ ling @-@ ai in the third township . ) The above specialized in small stores , without any sideline .
There were many people in the villages whose main occupation was farming , with commerce as a sideline ( deriving 80 percent of their income from farming and 20 percent from commerce ) , constituting about 40 percent of all the households ( 40 households in 100 ) .
The majority of them were poor peasants and a minority were middle peasants .
As they did not have sufficient income for their living , they did some porterage to supplement it , such as going to Chiang @-@ k &apos;ou , Han @-@ chou and Hu @-@ k &apos;ou @-@ mien and carrying along some oil as capital to bring back salt .
Or , they might carry eggs to sell in Chia @-@ ying @-@ chou ( Mei @-@ hsien ) and bring back salt .
Merchants in the district with capital of 50 yuan or more numbered 12 .
Of the 12 , 9 were counterrevolutionary and 3 were not .
Among the 12 , only the 4 with capital of 500 yuan hired clerks , 3 of them hiring 1 each and the remaining one hiring 2 .
The 8 remaining ones did not hire any help .
There were 34 stores with capital of 20 yuan or less .
Those operating them are called store owners , but actually poor people ; therefore , there is no counterrevolutionary among them .
All the stores are still in business &#91; except the opium dens &#93; .
The 34 so @-@ called &quot; stores &quot; with capital of 20 yuan and 10 yuan included :
9 inns ( 4 in the first township ; 5 in the second , all located in Yung @-@ feng
Market ) .
4 opium dens 2 candy stores 4 butcher shops 4 rice shops 1 woodenware shop 1 ironware store
4 variety goods stores ( above all in Yung @-@ feng Market )
5 tea shops ( 4 in Yung @-@ feng Market ; 1 in the third township ) .
In the land division this time , except those who were killed or who had fled , merchants with capital of 50 yuan or more whose stores were sealed or closed were given land .
Only three stores whose owners are not counterrevolutionary are still in business .
One is a butcher shop in Yung @-@ feng Market with an original capital of 300 yuan .
The owner was assessed a donation of 220 yuan , leaving him only 80 yuan .
He has 15 mouths to feed and is not counterrevolutionary .
Originally he owned 60 piculs of land .
In the land division , the owner , Chi &apos;en Shao @-@ lin received half a share and the 14 members of his family each received a full share .
Thus , he has a little more land now than before .
His brother Ch &apos;en Shao @-@ ying served as a company commander in the Third Army ( formerly the Second Regiment ) ; therefore , his family is revolutionary .
He serves as the chairman of the village government .
The second establishment is a medicine store in Chu @-@ k &apos;eng with a capital of 50 yuan .
The owner received half share of land and the members of his family each received 1 share .
The third is a variety goods and silverware store in Hsi @-@ chiang with a capital of 100 yuan .
The owner is not counterrevolutionary .
The township government assessed him a donation ( amount unknown ) .
The owner received half share of land and his family members each received one share .
In regard to the 34 small stores belonging to the poor , as the business of the four inns in the first township and one candy store in the third township has always been bad and the owners have always relied mostly on farming for their living , they and their family members each received a full share of land .
As for the 29 stores in Yung @-@ feng Market , in the past , the owners had no land but operated their small business exclusively .
After the revolution , aside from the four opium dens which closed down , the candy , butcher , rice , woodenware , ironware , variety goods and tea shops , and the inns have not only continued in operation , but the business has not dropped .
Even so , they still received land allocations , the owners getting half shares and their family members full shares .
Those without draft animals or farm tools borrow them from relatives .
In general , that the stores with capital of 50 yuan or more ( actually they were mostly small stores ) suffered severely in the revolution was a result of the excessive leftist policy of the area .
The poor operating stores with capital of 10 or 20 yuan were greatly benefited .
Besides receiving land allocations , they have reduced the expenses for social obligations , can acquire a wife easily , do not have to spend money on the dead , and have gained political recognition .
All these benefits are the same as the poor peasants .
Such poor people and small peddlers belong to the same class as the poor peasants .
Therefore , the benefits gained by them are not much different .
Vagrants
There were the following categories of vagrants in the district ,
( 1 ) Gamblers : About 50 or more in the entire district , including about 10 in the first township , about 20 in the second , all in Yung @-@ feng Market , 6 in the third and about 20 in the fourth .
In the past , 9 out of 10 gamblers smoked opium , but they do not do so anymore .
There is not one counterrevolutionary among the 50 or more gamblers in the district .
When they
heard about knocking down the local tyrants and dividing the land , they were very pleased .
In the past , they had no clothes in cold weather and were dressed in rags , but now they have good clothes to wear .
In the past , they would have fish and meat when they had money but starve when the money ran out , but now , though they do not have delicacies , they can eat rice every day .
Eight out of 10 of them had no .
family .
Now , with the land allocated to them , they borrow draft animals and tools from their relatives to farm the land .
As gamblers were always generous , it is easy for them to borrow things now .
Among the 10 in the first township , one of them originally served as a finance committee member in the fourth township government .
He was an honest gambler , had good credit and performed well as a finance committee member after the revolution .
Among the 20 in the second township , four of them are working in the township government : T &apos;ien Shang @-@ jen serves as propaganda department chief in the district government ; had a house ; no family ; joined the revolution the year before last ; house burned down by the pacification force .
Ch &apos;en Kun @-@ t ? ung joined the revolution the year before last ; served as judge in the district government ; subsequently became commander of the Third Company in the Reserve Army .
Yang Ta @-@ hu joined the revolution the year before last ; became chairman of the township government in the revolution in the 2d month this year ; performed well ; subsequently joined the district government .
Chfen @-@ Shao @-@ chi &apos;i joined the revolution the year before last ; became land section chief of the township in the 2d month this year .
Among the six in the third township , Lei Yung @-@ huang has a family ; used to gamble and sell opium ; joined the revolution in the second month this year ; serves as finance section chief in the township government ; very loyal and honest .
( 2 ) Beggars : There were four beggars in the first township , five in the second , four in the third and four in the fourth , totaling 17 .
They were people entirely without a future .
Most of them had no family ; only 4 out of the 17 had families .
The entire families of these four begged .
Now , after receiving land , they borrow draft animals and tools from their relatives .
None of them has done any government work after the revolution .
( 3 ) Water @-@ pipe tobacco sellers : There were two in the second township and one in the fourth , totaling three .
The two in the second township both had wives and sons .
Their wives leased farms from others to farm , but they themselves did not pursue any proper occupation .
They sold water @-@ pipe tobacco in gambling dens .
The one in the fourth township had no family and did not farm .
Now they have all been allocated land .
None of them has worked in the government since the revolution .
( 4 ) Horoscopists : There was only one in the fourth township ; no family ; did not farm ; specialized in fortune @-@ telling ; received land allocation .
( 5 ) Kuan @-@ yin &#91; Goddess of Mercy &#93; pickers : There was one in the first township ; , land was allocated to him .
( 6 ) Taoist priests : three in the first township ; all had families ; did not farm ; performed religious work ; two in the second township ; neither had family ; did not farm ; one in the third township ; had family ; did some farming .

( 7 ) Monks : Two in the fourth township , each occupying a temple ; collected
rent to live on . Originally from Kao @-@ hsing Market .
After the revolution ,
they returned to Kao @-@ hsing Market where land was allocated .
( 8 ) Entertainers : They gave puppet shows .
One in the third township ; had family ; farmed ; now serving with the 20th Army .
Two in the fourth township ; had families ; farmed ; now working in the village government .
All three were allocated land .
( 9 ) Fortune @-@ tellers : One in the first township ; single ; has brothers ; joined the revolution last year ; has been serving as propaganda section chief in the township government since the 2d month this year .
Two in the second township ; one of them blind ; both had families .
Their wives farmed and they told fortunes .
Land was allocated to them .
Blind man Ch &apos;en Hsin @-@ po was &quot; a famous fortune @-@ teller . &quot; For his accuracy in telling the fortune of a magistrate , the magistrate gave him 10 yuan . &quot; As he was blind , he received a double @-@ share of land14 ku .
There were four fortune @-@ tellers in the third township ; all had families .
Three of them farmed and one did not .
The families did the farming while they told fortunes .
Wow , three of them work in the government .
Tseng Chling @-@ lung , one of them , joined the revolution in the 2d month last year , &quot; most articulate , &quot; has been serving as land section chief in the district government and performing well .
He formerly had several ku of land which he rented to his uncle ; unmarried .

There were 17 fortune @-@ tellers altogether .
The nine categories of vagrants discussed above , totaling 90 persons , generally welcomed the revolution .
Not only did none of them resist the revolution , but 10 of them have joined the district or township government in leadership work and one has become a guerrilla commander .
This is noteworthy .
The vagrants have gained many benefits in the revolution .
Aside from the nine categories discussed above , the district has no other vagrants .
Current Condition of Land Division 6 .
Division of Farmland
( 1 ) Unit of division ; All four townships used the village as the unit to divide the farmland .
As the townships are large and have many mountains , it would have been difficult to take each township as one unit , because the great distances would make it impractical to farm .
The peasants preferred to get a little less land in their own village rather than going to another village .
In villages where the farmland was less and the hills more , each person received a little less farmland and a little more hills , and vice versa .
The result was &quot; not much difference . &quot;
( 2 ) Method of division : The &quot; order from above &quot; was to complete the division in 3 days .
Actually , it was completed in the first and third townships in 7 days , and the second and fourth in 8 days .
( The time was too short . )
The first township has 15 villages , the second and fourth 7 villages each , and the third 8 villages .
At the beginning of the division , the district government sent propaganda officers to the villages to hold mass meetings .
Notice was given half a day in advance to call the people together .
The men came , but not the women and children under 10 years of age .
The propaganda officers explained to the people the benefits and methods of burning the deeds and dividing the land .
One propaganda officer could hold mass meetings in two different villages in a day .
At that time , the reaction of the people attending the meetings was : &quot; It certainly sounds good , but we don &apos;t know whether the regulations are stable or not . &quot; Some said : &quot; The documents ( contracts ) are burned ; the debts are cancelled .
While land division , thanks to the Red Army , is good , it may not be reliable .
Now that the land is divided , most likely we will have to pay rent . &quot; At the mass meetings , a village government chairman , a secretary , a finance section chief , a land section chief and two executive secretaries , an organization section chief , a propaganda section chief , a grain section chief , a military affairs section chief , and a communications officer were elected .
The Yang @-@ fang village government of the first township was elected at the mass meeting in the forenoon of the 25th day of the 2d month , lunar calendar .
The propaganda officer left for another village .
The masses ( 60 or 70 out of the total population of over 180 in the village attended the meeting ) adjourned for lunch .
Returning in the afternoon , the village government called a meeting .
Chairman Chung En @-@ ming ( an independent laborer ; no farm ; worked as cook ; made beancakes to sell ; made rice candies to sell at shows in other areas ) served as chairman of the meeting .
The following items were decided on :
( a ) Ask the wealthy families for donations for use as village government expenses .
This matter to be handled by the finance section .
( b ) No grain may be shipped out of the village .
This matter to be handled by the grain section .
( c ) Concentrate all weapons of the village .
This matter to be handled by the military affairs section .
( d ) Make land surveys and divisions .
This matter to be handled by the land section .
The 4 days between the 26th and the 29th were devoted to land survey .
Land section chief Fu Chi @-@ t &apos;ing ( a member of the survey committee ) led land executive secretaries Chung En @-@ sheng and Chung En @-@ jen ( both poor peasants ) and the four unit chiefs ( the village was divided into four units , every 10 households per unit ) to check the farmland by households and record the locations and sizes of the farms .
The survey was completed in 4 days and the total area of farmland ascertained .
Dividing the total by the number of population in the village , they obtained the area per person .
Fu Hua @-@ lung owned 230 tan of land , completely farmed by himself ; 10 mouths to feed ; owed over 300 yuan in debts ; hired one cowherd ; had one large buffalo .
His land was inferior ; actually could only harvest over 140 tan .
He needed half of that to feed the 10 members of the family , leaving the remaining half as surplus .
After paying interests on the debts and rent on the land ( a part of which was not very productive ) amounting to over 40 tan , he had around 30 tan left over .
He was , therefore , a middle peasant with some surplus .
Chung Hsien @-@ hui farmed his own 70 @-@ odd tan of land , feeding three .
In the past , he had money to lend , but last year he used up his money to build a house .
He hired a regular help for 6 months out of the year .
Besides feeding his family , he had a surplus of over 30 tan every year .
He was also a middle peasant .
He had four brothers , not living together .
Besides him , one of them could make a living , but the remaining three had a hard time .
Now , Fu Hua @-@ lung and Chung Hsien @-@ hui complained that the survey was unfair , and that their farms were over @-@ rated .
The several dozen poor peasants , hired help , and workers all objected to their complaint and declared the survey of the land section correct .
The three rich peasants at the meeting all obeyed the dispositions and kept quiet .
Everyone approved the results of the survey and immediately wanted to &quot; shovel out &quot; so much from a certain household to be given to a certain other household and to &quot; shovel in &quot; so much by a certain household from a certain other household .
Those households which had to surrender land decided on the part to be surrendered ; therefore , they surrendered the inferior portions .
As the struggle was not yet intensive at that time , those who obtained inferior Jand were so pleased to get land at all that they did not complain .
The meeting on that day did the work of &quot; taking the surplus to supplement the shortage . &quot; After division , the village government secretary recorded it in .
books , without posting .
From the 25th day of the 2d month to the 1st of the 3d month , the land division was completed in 7 days .
After division , &quot; immediate transfer &quot; or &quot; fall transfer11 became a struggle between the poor and rich peasants .
At the time of land division in the 2d month , it was after seeding , before transplanting and in the midst of plowing .
Most of the transfers were done immediately .
However , some rich peasants wanted to see which way the wind blew and hoped that the pacification force would return and nullify the division .
They told the poor
peasants : &quot; I have already fertilized and plowed .
Let us not transfer this year .
Let me harvest before transfer , and I will give you 40 percent of the harvest . &quot; Some of the poor peasants accepted the proposal , feeling that it was a good deal to get 40 percent without doing anything .
Some of the hired help and workers actually could not immediately take over the land to farm .
Therefore , about 10 percent in the district followed the &quot; 40 percent &quot; method and did not take an immediate transfer .
Division of Hills
Land was divided between the end of the 2d month and the beginning of the 3d month .
The hills were not divided until the end of the 5th month .
In Yang @-@ fang Village , the hills began to be divided on the 27th day of the 5th month , because the order from above did not arrive until then .
( Note how great is the effect of the order from above ! ) The township government sent propaganda officer Liu Ta @-@ lun ( intellectual ; eager in work ; but was discovered , on the 17th day of the 8th month , to be secretary of the AB League ; killed by the district government ; 11 persons of the AB League were killed on that day .
Probably a mistake to kill someone like Liu Ta @-@ lun ) to the village to hold a mass meeting and propagandize the method of dividing the hills .
Seven new land executive secretaries were elected and hill division was decided on .
On that day , the propaganda officer reported on the matter of the poor people &apos;s loan office .
It was decided that it would be carried out .
Hill division was even more difficult than land division .
As there were big and small hills , more or less firewood , big or small trees , or no tree at all , it was difficult to divide .
The land section chief and the seven executive secretaries went out together , covered all the hills in the village , and decided on the method .
Instead of dividing by area , the hills would be divided according to the amount of oil @-@ bearing tea plants therein contained .
One tan of &quot; t &apos;ao &quot; ( 1 tan of tea @-@ seed worth 2 strings of coppers , is known as 1 tan of &quot; t &apos;ao &quot; ) was taken as the unit .
Thirty big plants , 60 medium ones , or 120 small ones were considered as 1 tan of &quot; t &apos;ao . &quot; The hills of the entire village were converted into &quot; t &apos;ao , &quot; then evenly divided among the population and marked by stakes .
In Yang @-@ fang Village , it took 4 days to divide the hills clearly .
The eight men of the land section had the authority to do the division , &quot; not according to the opinions of the individuals , because the matter would never be settled if everyone had his say . &quot;
In Ch &apos;ang @-@ chiao Village in the third township , the village government issued 2.10 yuan to the five men of the land section ( one chief and four executive secretaries ) for .
meals , and it took them over 30 days to complete the division .
&quot; One can see how difficult it was ! &quot;
Though the hills were divided , only the branches of the trees could be cut , not the trunks .
Government approval was required to cut down trees .
Division of Ponds
With the village as the unit and according to the size of the ponds , the people were formed into teams to stock the ponds with fingerlings .
Five households formed one team for a big pond and three households for a small pond .
One team took charge of one pond .
All the households would do the stocking at the same time with the same number of fingerlings , and the fish , when caught , would be divided evenly .
Water for the ponds in the district was no problem ; the problem was fish .
Some few mountain ponds had a water problem .
Thus , mountain ponds which could support fish were divided according to the above method .
For those which could not , they were assigned along with the farms , and whoever owned the farm owned the pond .
The fingerlings stocked before the revolution would not be divided when grown and caught , but belonged to the persons stocking them .
When the ponds became dry in the winter this year , the original owners would catch the fish .
Only then would the new owners stock the ponds .
Division of Houses
In principle , houses should be divided .
Many poor peasants with families of 10 or more members lived in two or three rooms .
Generally speaking , the housing of 60 percent of the poor peasants was inadequate ; the good houses were all occupied by the rich peasants .
The poor peasants all clamored for division of houses , but the government said : &quot; No official communication from above . &quot; So , the poor peasants did not dare to go and live in the rich peasants1 houses .
At the mass meeting in Yang @-@ fang Village , the poor peasants demanded division of houses .
The land section chief said : &quot; Those with more rooms should give up a few to those not having enough . &quot; But there was no resolution .
The rich peasants refused to yield , and the poor peasants did not dare to force the matter .
( One can see the importance of &quot; communication from above ! &quot;
The division of houses should be done with each village taken as a unit .
For adjacent houses , those with more rooms should give some to those with less rooms .
In the district , only the houses of landlords , rich peasants and unscrupulous merchants who had been killed or expelled due to their reaction &apos;if such houses had not been burned ( burning was not right ) were occupied by the poor peasants , but there was no formal allocation .
As for those who had not been killed or expelled , even if they had extra rooms , such rooms were not given to those with less rooms .
In regard to the houses of counterrevolutionary landlords and rich peasants which were burned ( burned by the guerrillas ) , there were 1 in the first township , 2 in the second , 5 in the third and 4 in the fourth , altogether 12 , including the houses of three landlords and nine rich peasants .
In regard to houses of revolutionary workers and peasants which were burned
( burned by counterrevolutionaries ) , none in the first township , 7 in the second , 8 in the third and 8 in the fourth , altogether 23 , including the houses of 1 middle peasant , 20 poor peasants , 1 small merchant and 1 vagrant .
Public Land
In the land division in the 2d month , public land was reserved in every township and every village .
In the first township , over 10 tan of land were reserved in Yang @-@ fang Village and over 30 in Ch &apos;an @-@ kan Village .
In the second township , 11 tan were reserved in Chih @-@ ko Village .
In ChTang @-@ chiao Village of the third township , as land was scarce and 16 persons had not been allocated land , no public land was reserved .
All other villages reserved public land .
In Hou @-@ ching Village in the fourth township , over 100 tan of land were reserved , the entire parcel suffering from flood .
Why was public land reserved ?
First , the remainder after division was hard to dispose of ; thus , it was reserved .
For example , if everyone received 7 tan , with a remainder of 10 @-@ odd tan , if divided , it would not be enough to let everyone have 1 t &apos;ung &#91; 2729 &#93; each ; therefore , the remainder was reserved as public land .
Second , it helped pay government expenses .
Third , it was in anticipation of sons to be born next year .
There would be a re @-@ division in the 8th month , because official communication from above ordered thorough division , including the public land .
Actually , it would have been better not to reserve public land .
First , as there are deaths as well as births , there is no worry of giving birth to a son without a farm .
Second , the government will get its revenue by land taxes ; it does not have to rely on public farms for its expenses .
Furthermore , as shown by the examples in the 2d month , all the public land reservations are inferior and not very useful .
Therefore , it is better to divide all the land so that the peasants can get greater benefit .
Amount of Land Distribution
The villages varied .
In Yang @-@ fang Village of the first township , for instance , each person received 5 @-@ 6 tan of land ( 8 tan in the 2d month , but actually only 5 @-@ 6 tan of grain could be harvested ) .
In Ch &apos;a @-@ kan Village , each person received 8 tan .
In Chih @-@ ko Village in the second township , each person received 7 tan .
In Ch &apos;ang @-@ chiao Village in the third township , the amounts in the 2d and 8th months were different .
In the 2d month , there were four different allocations , 7 tan , 6 1 / 2 tan , 5 1 / 2 tan , and 4 tan 1 t &apos;ung .
The division was initially done on the basis of surnames , and people with more land refused to yield their land to people of different surnames .
Not until the 8th month was the land divided with each village considered as one unit , each person receiving 6 tan .
In Hou @-@ ching of the fourth township , each person received 8.5 tan in the 2d month .
When the land was re @-@ divided in the 8th month , inferior land which was previously counted as 2 tan but produced 1 tan was considered as 1 tan only .
There were also people returning from out @-@ of @-@ town .
As a result , each person received only 7.5 tan .
Hsing @-@ kuo produces only one crop a year .
According to the amount of land discussed above , there was barely enough for everyone .
By planting miscellaneous grains and raising pigs , the people could supply themselves with oil , salt , cloths and sundry goods .
The major miscellaneous grain of the district is sweet potato , constituting 40 percent of the staple food of the people .
The first township produces relatively less sweet potato , because of the soil .
It constitutes only 20 percent of the staples .
The second and third townships are entirely different , the percentage of sweet potato consumed by the people as staple food amounts to from 50 to 70 percent .
Shredded potatoes mixed in rice are eaten all year round .
The people of the fourth township eat an average of 40 percent sweet potatoes .
Land Tax
Known as &quot; public welfare fund , &quot; land tax began to be collected at the beginning of the 8th month ( lunar calendar ) : 1 percent on 6 tan of land ( 6 sheng per person ) , 1.5 percent on 7 tan of land , 2,5 percent on 8 tan of land ( 2 tou per person ) , and 3,5 percent on 9 tan of land ( 3,15 tou per person ) .
No one in the district has 9 tan of land ; therefore , the highest rate of public welfare fund is 2,5 percent ,
Yang @-@ fang Village of the first township has a population of over 180 , each allocated 8 tan of land ( according to the figures of land division in the 2d month ) .
At 2,5 percent , the total collection was 36.4 tan .
The .
397 population of Ch &apos;a--kan Village each received 8 tan of land , and the total tax collection was 79.4 tan .
No tax was collected on the 5,5 tan of land per person in Ch &apos;ang @-@ chiao Village in the third township .
( Tax was collected on 6 tan of land or more . ) This year the district will probably collect around 1,000 tan in taxes .
The taxes collected in the 8th month are mostly deposited in the villages .
A portion was delivered to the township government , but none to the district government .
During tax collection in the 8th month , the county government , in its official communication , permitted the people to pay in grain or cash by converting grain into cash at the conversion rate of 30 wen &#91; 2429 &#93; for 1 catty of grain .
As the market price at that time was only 20 wen per catty , no one wanted to pay in cash .
When the public welfare fund was first collected , 10 percent of the people objected to it .
When the officials came to their houses , they said : &quot; You said before that we were to resist rents and taxes , but now you are collecting taxes again ! &quot; When collecting the public welfare fund , the order from above was very urgent , allowing 3 days to deliver the grain to the township government .
The township government summoned the land section chiefs of the villages for a meeting .
The first township was divided into nine Red Guards brigades , and one member of each brigade ( land section chief ) attended the meeting .
It was decided that the
responsible persons of the villages should hold meetings and collect the taxes after the meeting .
No mass meeting was held .
Each brigade was taken as a unit for tax collection .
The 8th brigade , for instance , was organized by Yang @-@ fang , Ling @-@ yuan and Li @-@ yao villages .
The brigade leader , land section chiefs , three team leaders and nine unit leaders proceeded to the three villages and collected household by household ( each village constituting a team ) .
They measured the grain at each household , at 90 catties per tan , and the particular household delivered the grain to the township government .
The brigade collected almost 400 tan of grain in public welfare fund .
In Ch &apos;a @-@ kan Village of the 1st township , written notices were sent to the households 2 days in advance , requesting them to deliver the public welfare fund to the public granary .
On due date , the households carried the grain to the granary ( formerly known as the public granary ) , and it was received by the responsible person ( five men ) of the township .
It took them less than a day to complete the job , receiving a total of more than 70 tan of grain .
It was announced in advance that whoever did not deliver the grain on time would have to be responsible for the meal expenses of the five responsible persons .
To avoid such expenses , everyone delivered his grain on time .

The district government is located in Yung @-@ feng Market .
Between the 2d and 9th months , there were held over 20 district mass meetings and 2 district delegates &apos; meetings ( delegates elected at mass meetings of the villages ) .
There were few district mass meetings before the 6th month .
After the 6th month , as the struggles became intensified , many mass meetings were held .
After the 4th month , women and children all attended the mass meetings .
Township Government
Goverment of the first township as an example :
Chairman Hsieh Chin @-@ ming : Poor peasant and porter ; owned very little land .
Treasurer Chung Kuo @-@ ch &apos;un : Middle peasant .
Military Affairs Officer Yang T &apos;ing @-@ jung : Poor peasant ; owned very little land .
Propaganda Officer Hsieh Chung @-@ k &apos;ai : Poor peasant ; owned land but in debt .

Secretary I Yung @-@ hung ; Father was a barber ; impoverished ; studied , Judge Ch &apos;en Yu @-@ shu : From Lien @-@ t &apos;ang ; studied .
Fu Chi @-@ t &apos;ing : Poor peasant .
Of the 10 persons above , there were 6 poor peasants , 2 middle peasants , 1 rich peasant and 1 scholar from outside .
Mass meetings in the township were much less frequent than the district less than 10 times .
Before the 4th month , women and children did not attend meetings , but they did after the 4th month .
Some six or seven township delegates1 meetings were held , attended by 30 to 40 persons per township , with one to two delegates from each village .
Some non @-@ delegates from villages near the township government also attended .
Each meeting lasted 3 to 4 hours .
The delegates expressed themselves quite fully .
The chairman was elected pro tempore ..
Village Government
There were village governments between the 2d and 5th months , because they were needed for land division .
Once the land was divided , it was no longer necessary to have a village government .
Furthermore , money would be needed to run a government .
Even if no meal was provided , there had to be some operation expenses .
After the revolution intensified and the land divided , every 10 households were organized into a group , and there was also the Red Guards brigade .
Therefore , it was alright not to have a village government .
Shortcomings of Government Personnel
( 1 ) The first is bureaucraticism , putting on airs , and aversion to associating with the masses .
When the people ask for information in the government , the officials will say something when they feel like it , but when they don &apos;t , they will ignore them altogether , or even accuse them of &quot; making trouble .
( 2 ) They sell the things belonging to the reactionaries which have been confiscated instead of giving them to the poor .
People without connections in the government cannot buy them ; only those with contact and who are articulate can buy them .
Furthermore , as the things are for sale , only people with some money can buy them , and the hired help and extremely poor peasants naturally have no share .
( 3 ) They assign women to work in the government , always one or two in the township government , and three or four in the district government .
It is a good thing for women to work in the government , but the choice is not proper .
If a woman is not pretty , even if she is articulate and capable , she is not selected .
On the other hand , if she is pretty , even if
inarticulate and incapable , she is selected .
It is the same when the officials of the township government go to the villages to hold meetings .
They will talk to the pretty women and ignore the plain ones .
( 4 ) This is the major point .
It is the violation of the people &apos;s will .
Government committee members are decided by a few , and elections at the delegates * meetings are mere formalities .
In one instance , the chairman asked the people to raise their hands if they approved of a certain person .
Some people did not raise their hands , and the chairman accused them of belonging to the AB League .
Another time , the chairman glared at those not raising their hands and demanded to know why .
Furthermore , only communist party members may work in the government .
The non @-@ members , even if they are mass leaders , cannot work in the government .
( I told the people attending the meeting that such bad things only happened in the early stage of the land revolution , that one of the reasons was that the components of government were not very good , and that there would be changes in the future , because such bad things were not right . )
Rural Militarization 1 .
Red Guards
There were nine brigades in the first township , three in the second , four in the third and four in the fourth .
The method of organization was as follows : 8 to 12 persons constituted a unit , 3 units a team and 3 teams a brigade .
Generally , a brigade consisted of 80 to 90 persons in the townships of this district .
The 8th brigade in the first township , for instance , included the 1st team of Yang @-@ fang , the 2d team of Ling @-@ yuan and the 3d team of Li @-@ yao , totaling over 90 persons .
Members of the Red Guards were between the ages of 23 and 50 .
All members of the Red Guards were men .
At the beginning , it was divided into regular and reserve Red Guards .
Subsequently , they were combined , without distinction of regular or reserve .
The tasks of the Red Guards were patrolling day and night in every village .
A patrol shed was required at the main entrance to every village .
In ordinary times , the Children &apos;s League and Young Pioneers patrolled in the day time .
The regulation called for five persons in one day , two from the Girls &apos; League , two from the Boys &apos; League , and one from the Young Pioneers doing the checking .
The Young Pioneers must be literate , able to read the passes .
A pass was required of everyone , regardless of who , and it was required even for traveling from village A to village B.
Night patrol was handled by the Red Guards , generally four persons a night , two persons per shift , one shift taking the first half of the night and the other shift the second half .
When the situation became tense ( as when the pacification force advanced close to Chun @-@ ts &apos;un on the 7th day of the 7th month ) , the Red Guards patrolled both day and night , and additional personnel were
assigned patrol duty .
Though still A or 5 in day time , they were increased to 10 or more , or even 20 or more , at night .
Each Red Guards brigade had a commander , who must be the most earnest person in the township and had some knowledge of military affairs , and a political commissar , who must also be the most earnest person in the township and able to read official documents .
Drills were previously required of the Red Guards .
After organizing the Red Army reserve in the 7th month , they were abolished .
The Red Guards was divided into men &apos;s and women &apos;s Red Guards .
The 8th brigade jointly organized by Yang @-@ fang , Ling @-@ yuan and Li @-@ yao villages in the first township , for instance , consisted of men &apos;s Red Guards 8th brigade and womenTs Red Guards 8th brigade .
The age limits for women were the same as for men , but there were fewer members , because the number of women was smaller than men , and the pregnant and nursing women were excluded .
Generally , each consisted of 40 persons ( the third brigade of the second township ) to 50 persons ( the 8th brigade of the first township ; the 3d brigade of the third township ) .
Sometimes , it could be less than 40 or more than 50 .
Women Red Guards ordinarily did not perform patrol duty .
In emergencies when the men Red Guards sallied forth ( going out on combat duty was called &quot; sallying forth &quot; ) , the women would handle the patrolling .
The women Red Guards must also drill , once a month , lasting 2 or 3 hours .
The brigade leader and political commissar were both women .
Drilling was conducted by a member of the men &apos;s Red Guards .
When the able @-@ bodied men in the Red Guards were organized into the Red Army reserve in the 6th month , leaving some 10 , 20 or 30 old weak per brigade , drilling was abolished .
For the men &apos;s Red Guards , there were a commander and a political commissar in each township .
They were not stationed in the township government , but remained in their own homes .
When the occasion arose , they were assigned wherever needed .
They must attend the township @-@ wide drills .
The Red Guards of the various townships had held township @-@ wide drills twice .
Young Pioneers
Wherever there was a Red Guards brigade , there was a Young Pioneer brigade .
The members included both male and female , age 16 to 23 .
There were a brigade commander and a political commissar .
Each brigade consisted of three teams , and each team three units .
But the number of members was less than that of a Red Guards brigade , ranging from 20 ( Chi @-@ ko village in the second township , 30 ( Cli &apos;ang @-@ chiao village of the third township ) , to 50 to 60 ( the 3 villages in the first township including Yang @-@ fang ) .
Groups of 20 to 30 were called teams ; groups of 50 to 60 were called brigades .
Since the 6th month , courageous elements were selected and organized into the Red Army reserve and the district Special Service Battalion .
The remaining members of the pioneers still had to drill , twice a month .
Only the men &apos;s Red Guards no longer had to drill since its able @-@ bodied elements were organized into the Red Army reserve .
After the pioneers were organized into the Red Army reserve and district Special Service Battalion , very few members were left .
Some places did not have a Young Pioneer at all ( such as the three villages in the first township , including Yang @-@ fang ; and Chih @-@ ko village of the second township ) .
Children &apos;s League
There was no distinction of male or female .
The age limit was 8 to 15 .
Where there were Red Guards and Young Pioneers , there was a laboring Children &apos;s League .
Each village had a league leader , none in the townships but one in the district .
The work of the Children &apos;s League was first , patrolling , next , checking on opium smoking and gambling , and last , eliminating superstition and knocking down buddha idols .
The Children &apos;s League was most ruthless in checking on opium smoking and gambling and in knocking down idols .
They gave no quarter , &quot; truly handling public affairs in a public way . &quot; They attended mass meetings .
Their weapons consisted mainly of wooden guns , with a few lances .
All members of the league were students of the peoplefs school .
The people &apos;s school was started in the 7th month , five in the first township , three in the second , seven in the third and one in the fourth , totaling 16 .
The district government provided for three such schools in every township and paid for the food of three teachers , 0.10 yuan , large currency , per day , and 2 yuan , large currency , for expenses per month , totaling 5 yuan , large currency , per month .
As the area of the first township was large , it was permitted to have five schools .
The third township had many hills , and three schools were not enough ; therefore , they had four additional ones , totaling seven , but the expenses were still limited to 15 yuan , averaging 2.10 yuan per school .
The number of enrollment ranged from 20 or more to 120 , usually over 40 .
The peopleTs school jointly established by Yang @-@ fang , Ling @-@ yuan and Li @-@ yao villages of the first tonwship , for instance , had over 120 children between the ages of 8 and 15 .
The housing was insufficient , and one teacher could not handle all of them ; therefore , many could not attend school .
Only around 60 of the 120 were in school .
Originally , the three villages wanted to have three schools , but they had no teachers in the villages , nor did they have the money to pay for outside help .
Therefore , they could not have three schools .
The school in Chu @-@ chao @-@ an Village in the third township had only 21 students .
Every village had a people &apos;s night school .
Each school had one teacher , who was someone in the village who could read a little .
He received no pay , pursuing his own occupation at home during day time and teaching at night .
Fu Chi @-@ t &apos;ing of Yang @-@ fang and Chung Te ~ wu of Chfang @-@ chiao were both night school teachers .
The number of students varied .
The school in Yang @-@ fang had 40 students .
The students were of all ages , old , adult and young .
Most of the night schools had women students , about one @-@ third .
Some did not have women students , such as Ch &apos;a @-@ kan Village of the first township and Hou @-@ ching Village of the fourth township .
The Children &apos;s League was drilled three times a week , under the direction of the people &apos;s school , &quot; drilling well . &quot;
Picket Units
The Picket Unit was organized by workers , one company per township , with a company commander and a political commissar .
The Picket Unit of the second township consisted of 105 men .
Yang @-@ fang , Ling @-@ yuan and Ch &apos;a @-@ shih ( Ch &apos;a @-@ kan ) villages of the first township together had one platoon , consisting of 26 men .
Red Army Reserve
The Red Army reserve was organized from the strong and courageous elements in the Red Guards and the Young Pioneers , two companies per township , totaling eight companies in the district .
Each company consisted of several dozen to over 100 men .
The two companies in the first township had over 100 men each .
For the Hsin @-@ yu campaign this time , all the eight companies of the 10th district participated .
After its formation in the 7th month , the reserve was responsible for the advances on Ch &apos;i @-@ fang , Lang @-@ ch &apos;uan and Kan @-@ chou , and on Hsin @-@ yu this time .
When the reserve was away on a campaign , the Red Guards , the Young Pioneers , and the Children &apos;s League were responsible for village patrolling .
Upon its return , the reserve again joined the patrol , The eight companies of the district formed a regiment , with a regiment commander and a political commissar .
In ordinary times , there was no battalion .
The 1st and 2d companies belonged to the first township , the 3d and 4th companies to the second township , the 5th and 6th companies to the third township , and the 7th and 8th companies to the fourth township .
For the Hsin @-@ yu campaign this time , three battalions were formed , with the 1st , 2d and 3d companies as the 1st battalion , the 4th , 5th and 6th companies as the 2d battalion , and the 7th and 8th companies as the 3d battalion , led by battalion commanders and political commissars .
Each company had four porters , eight cooks , one to two messengers , one orderly , one bugler ( .unable to bugle ) , but no horse .
Each company also had two propaganda officers , with the duties of talking and writing slogans .
The battalion headquarters had no propaganda officer , aide or messenger .
The regimental headquarters had three propaganda officers , one aide and two messengers .
Members of the three battalion headquarters lived together with those of the regimental headquarters , sharing their meals .
Weapons were lances and shotguns .
District Special Service Battalion
It consisted of three companies , beginning to be organized in the 7th month , also selected among the Red Guards and Young Pioneers .
Organized from the younger and more courageous elements , it was better than the Red Army Reserve .
The members had organization and training , but were not regularly concentrated .
Ordinarily they remained at home pursuing their own occupation .
Three large drills were held every month , on the 2d , 12th and 22d days .
When needed , they were mastered to go out on campaigns .
Currently , the 1st and 3d companies were out fighting in Lang ~ chfuan ; the 2d company remained at home .
Their weapons were mainly shotguns , native rifles , native cannons , some lances , but no regular rifle .
The battalion headquarters was at the district government .
The battalion had a commander and a political commissar .
7 , Red Army Independent Regiment
Hsing @-@ kuo organized a total of three independent regiments , all presented to the Red Army .
Also selected among the Red Guards and the Young Pioneers ; they were the same in excellency as the Special Service Battalion .
They were all young people and volunteers .
Each regiment consisted of over 1,000 men .
The regiments , battalions and company all had commanders and political commissars .
The regiments underwent concentrated training at the county seat , and the members awaited assignment to the Red Army .
They were all unarmed .

DUTIES OF GENERAL POLITICAL DEPARTMENT AND RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RED ARMY POLITICAL DEPARTMENTS AND COMMISSARS
Order No 6 of the Revolutionary Military Commission , 17 February 1931
&#91; Text &#93; To organize a revolutionary war , a war to destroy the warlords , is currently the central task of the revolution .
To carry out this task , we must create an iron Red Army , and win over the broad masses of the people ; accordingly the strengthening of political education in the Red Army , so that commanders and fighters will understand their tasks and resolutely carry them out , and at the same time intensified propagandizing and organization of the masses , and mobilization of the broad masses within the war zone to arise and struggle , have become our most pressing tasks .
These tasks are performed by the Red Army &apos;s political commissars and political departments .
To oversee these tasks for Red Army units in all areas , a General Political Department is necessary .
At present the Red Army units throughout the country have made great progress ; but unifying and strengthening their political direction have become a pressing need .
To meet this need , we have set up a General Political Department in this Commission under the chairmanship of Mao Tse @-@ tung .
Out of practical necessity , this Commission &apos;s General Political Department will also serve temporarily as the First Front Army &apos;s General Political Department .
The General Political Department will direct the Red Army &apos;s political departments and guide the political work of the political commissars .
The Red Army political departments must give absolute obedience to the General Political Department &apos;s orders .
Orders relating to political work must likewise be accepted and obeyed by the political commissars .
Every Red Army political department must make reports to the General Political Department regularly and through channels .
Political commissars may make reports to political commissions at higher levels , but in addition they must make reports on political work to the political department at the next higher level .
Organizationally , the Red Army political departments and political commissars have their own individual organization systems , but in their work the lower @-@ level political departments take orders from the upper @-@ level political departments , and at the same time they must also follow the orders of the political commissars at the same level ; the
lower @-@ level political commissars take orders from the upper @-@ level political commissars , , but in political work they also follow the orders of the upper @-@ level political department .

NO INVESTIGATION , NO RIGHT TO SPEAK , NO PROPER INVESTIGATION AND NO RIGHT TO SPEAK
Notice of General Political Department on Social Investigation No2 April 1931 &#91; Text &#93; All Red Army Political Departments and Local Governments at All Levels
We have now drawn up population and land investigation forms .
In the main , these call for statistics on the proportions of land and population by class , so as to answer more concretely and with ironclad facts many of our current questions .
In the past , investigation of the actual facts was frequently scorned in many localities , and work plans were drawn up and used to direct the work of lower levels merely on the basis of things thought up out of thin air .
As a result the plans could not be carried out and leadership went wrong .
If we can now fill in these forms with correct statistics , arrived at by close attention to reality , we will be able to solve many of our problems .
In particular , there are a number of practical land distribution problems in connection with which we hope that Red Army political departments will carefully fill in information for all localities and local governing organs will fill in information for each township .
We especially hope that every responsible person in the Red Army and the government will at all times and places perform these investigations and do these statistics .
Just what is needed to make the data from these investigations really correct ?
First , it is necessary to have a deep understanding of this work and a clear idea of its importance before one can undertake it in earnest .
Second , it the investigators must investigate a village painstakingly ; they must seek out the records of population and land surveys made for land distribution ; they must seek out the members of the land committee that carried out the land distribution and people who are well acquainted with the situation in the village ; they must begin by clearly distinguishing the class nature of each family and each field ( whether it belongs to a landlord , rich peasant , middle peasant or poor peasant ... ) tand then calculate things out strictly , filling in the form with the actual numbers .
Third , the comrades sent out by the higher government levels to direct the survey , or the responsible persons of the political departments , must explain clearly to the persons assigned the investigation work the content of the two forms and the points for attention when investigating .
In particular they must explain that : the standard for a rich peasant is that he depended upon exploitation for a sizeable part of his income ; those who are engaged in extending credit or lending money to others are still classed as middle peasants , and those who were hired laborers ( before the revolution ) and have rented some land to cultivate are poor peasants ; those none of whose family does any farming but who rely upon their independent labor ( tailors , carpenters , etc . ) to make a living are called independent laborers ; those who do some farming and some artisan work are classed as poor peasants , middle peasants and rich peasants according to their economic status ; free tradesmen and vagrants are distinguished by the fact that free tradesmen practice some specific trade ( as doctor , teacher ) , while vagrants have no fixed occupation or mode of life , but all do a good deal of mischief .
If all of these items are not clearly understood during the investigation , the investigators will not know how to do their jobs properly , and will surely get the class composition wrong and get wrong values in the statistics .
When these two forms , for land and population , are filled out in close cordination , care should be taken that the individual or group fills them out correctly .
They should then be mailed directly to the General Political Department of the Central Military Commission .
Our slogan is :
No investigation , no right to speak ;
No correct investigation , also no right to speak ,

QUESTION OF OPPOSING RICH PEASANTS
Notice Number 2 of Central Revolutionary Military Commission , 1931 &#91; Text &#93; 1 .
Reasons for Opposing the Rich Peasants
First , rich peasants are rural semi @-@ landlords and capitalists , and an exploiting class .
They support feudal power and want to be capitalists , and are entirely in opposition to the interests of the workers , hired farm laborers , poor peasants and the mass of middle peasants .
In order to guard the interests of the workers , hired farm laborers , poor peasants and middle peasants , we must oppose the rich peasants .
Second , the rich peasants are an exploiting class .
They are constantly in close collusion with reactionary power in an attempt to undermine the revolution .
To consolidate the soviet governments and protect the victory of land reform , we must oppose the middle peasants .
Third , the rich peasants are taking the capitalist road .
We are taking the socialist road .
Therefore , they are completely opposite to us , and in order to make the revolution advance to the road of socialism we must intensify the struggle to oppose the rich peasants .
Errors in Opposing the Rich Peasants
In an examination of opposition to the rich peasants in the past , four major errors appear :
First , opposition to exploitation was not taken as the test , and opposition to the rich peasants was treated as a speical form of fund @-@ raising .
Rather than exploitation , possession of money was used as the test .
Money tests , in which for example people with less than 100 yuan were not beaten , but those with more than 100 yuan were beaten , were used by brigades , and in a minority of places it got to the point that people with more than 20 cash or an old sow got beaten , which terrified the masses and made them think the revolution was to make everybody poor instead of making everybody rich and improving their lives .
Second , there were encroachments on the middle peasants .
The second fault , of encroaching on the middle peasants &apos; interests , grew out of the first fault .
Middle peasants are those who have enough land and enough food and are not exploited by anyone , but also do not go out and exploit anyone else .
Not only should these people not be encroached upon , but we should link up closely with them instead and all oppose the rich peasants together .
Since the middle peasants will only join a revolution led by the proletariat , our revolutionary power can only reach its full force and the revolution can only develop rapidly when we unite with them .
Third , the rich peasants &apos; lands were not thoroughly redistributed .
In many places the land distribution was conducted just by taking away excesses and making up deficiencies rather than by taking away from rich lands and compensating poor lands .
When the rich peasants held such things as good lands , woodland , dwellings and ponds , these were not thoroughly distributed .
As a result the rich peasants were in a favored position economically and got hold of political leadership .
The Soviets &apos; governments and the revolutionary groups were captured by the rich peasants , who then used their political and economic power to exploit and oppress and impoverish the peasant masses .
The Correct Method of Opposing the Rich Peasants a .
Politically
First , consolidate proletarian leadership .
The soviet governments and Red Army and Red Guards units should prevent rich peasants from acting as committee members in the soviet governments or representatives to the soviet assemblies .
They should elect leaders of the workers , farm laborers and poor peasants and the most activist elements of the middle peasants to deliberate and take action ; they should also organize poor peasants &apos; associations and unite the broad masses of poor peasants and the middle peasants in a good alliance to oppose the rich peasants .
All those who have encroached on the middle peasants &apos; interests or fined them or taken money from the poor peasants must make restitution , and the lawless exactions of brigands , which have no class nature and are divorced from the masses must be opposed .
If these things continue to happen , they will assuredly be punished by the authorities .
Second , put down rich peasant reaction .
The rich peasants are an exploiting class , and are sure to use every available means to oppose and subvert the revolution .
Accordingly , in the soviet areas , constant and strict attention should be paid to preventing rich peasant reaction ; as soon as any rich peasant counterrevolutionary organization , such as the Ya @-@ pi @-@ t &apos;uan , etc . , is found conspiring with the White bandits , plotting reactionary activity , trying to subvert the revolution , etc . , the government must punish it strictly as being counterrevolutionary .
The rich peasants will be allowed to live and pursue their livelihood only if they obey all laws of the Soviets and refrain from counterrevolutionary conspiracies or activities .
Economically
First , oppose exploitation by the rich peasants .
At present , opposition to the rich peasants is not destruction of the rich peasants , but chiefly a resolute opposition in the economic sphere to all their exploitative activities , because these activities have increased the hardships of our workers and poor peasants .
The rich peasants will be allowed to hire laborers , so long as they treat them in accordance with the Laws for Protection of Labor .
They may not treat them harshly .
They may also engage in business , but will not be allowed to hold back on buying or selling or to lend money at high interest .
These more specific methods should be determined by the county government and preferably by the county assembly , in accordance with local conditions .
A program of this sort is not meant to eradicate capitalism but to oppose cruel exploitation by capitalists and to stimulate the vigorous development of social economics .
In the cases where exaction of money from the rich peasants is unavoidable , this should be done only for revolutionary needs .
The rich peasants should bear what they can afford .
But at present we are not eradicating the rich peasant economy .
As to the rich peasants &apos; lands , they should all be distributed evenly .
Second , an economic policy should be carried out .
The limiting of rich peasant exploitation discussed above is still a passive method .
But merely passive opposition to poor peasants is not enough ; we must also carry out an economic policy , in accordance with the social situation , to actively oppose the rich peasants .
For instance , the government should lead the masses in running loan cooperatives that lend money to the impoverished masses at low interest , in running production cooperatives to develop products , and in running trade cooperatives so as to lessen the exploitation carried on between businessmen and rich peasants .
Such organizations actively oppose exploitation by rich peasants .
If we help the broad impoverished masses take this step toward liberation , we are preparing social economics to develop toward socialism .
Guard Against Lingering Evils
Our earlier pointing out of errors in opposing middle peasants , and the statement that we are not now eradicating the rich peasants , should not lead people to take opposing the rich peasants lightly .
On .
the contrary , everyone should understand the policy of opposing the rich peasants and should eppose them even more intensely .
In rectifying policies , we should prevent rich peasant elements and their helpers hidden in the revolution from easing up on the work of opposing the rich peasants .
Even more important , the rich peasants should be prevented from taking the opportunity to oppose the government

OPEN LETTER TO FRATERNAL SOLDIERS OF THE WHITE ARMY ON THE FORCED OCCUPATION OF MANCHURIA BY JAPANESE IMPERIALISM
25 September 1931 &#91; Text &#93; Fraternal soldiers !
Did not warlords of the Kuomintang often tell you that your duty is to &quot; protect our country and defend our people ? &quot; But look , troops of Japanese imperialism have occupied by force all of the major cities in Manchuria , massacred with guns and bombs the toiling masses of workers and peasants and soldiers in Manchuria , and consider Manchuria wholly as a colony of theirs .
May I ask you : How are warlords of the Kuomintang performing their duty to &quot; protect our country and defend our people ? &quot; What are they saying to you now ?
As far as Japanese imperialist brutality is concerned , warlords of the Kuomintang order you to &quot; offer no resistance , &quot; to &quot; receive adverse circumstances with acquiescence , &quot; to stretch out the neck so as to allow the Japanese imperialist bandits to massacre you .
They order you to become &quot; colonial slaves &quot; of Japanese imperialism peaceably .
From here you can see that warlords of the Kuomintang can only pay court and yield to imperialism , they can only act as running dogs of imperialism , they not only cannot &quot; protect our country , &quot; but also cannot &quot; defend our people ! &quot;
Nevertheless , the Kuomintang warlords , for the purpose of struggling for positions and extending their areas of exploitation and wholesale slaughter of the Chinese people , they have staged wild battles among themselves year after year .
For the sake of these warlords * wars , they have very courageously driven you to the battlefield to kill your own brothers and destroy the life and property of the people .
They are exacting exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies , impressing men and horses for military coolie @-@ service , and sucking dry the last drop of blood of the toiling people .
They are massacring the revolutionary workers and peasants ; they are compelling people to cultivate opium so as to infect the masses ; they are creating all over the country calamities ( flood , drought , famine ) , , the like of which has never been seen before .
In exploiting and massacring the people , they all have shown considerable resoluteness and fearlessness !
Above all others , at a time when the masses of workers and peasants in our Soviet areas , standing up voluntarily , have driven out all imperialists , toppled the rule of the Kuomintang , confiscated all land of the landlord class , carried out the 8 @-@ hour work system , created their own armed forces in the Workers and Peasants1 Red Army , and established the Workers and Peasants &apos; Soviet Government , all warlords of the Kuomintang are fighting desperately for their lives and demonstrating their determination and bravery , have relied upon help from the imperialists to attack us , not once or twice , but three times .
They have used planes , bombs , poison gas , artillery , and machine guns to slaughter the people in the Soviet areas .
All their attacks have been smashed fearlessly by us and by the people , but if we do not root them out completely , they will never ease up on us .
In attacking the Soviet Government of the people and the Red Army of the people , they also are extremely brave !
Fraternal soldiers !
Have you not suffered enough from , the deceit and oppression of these warlords ?
Think about it : After all , why are you risking your life for these warlords ?
It may be that you are doing it so as to support your family .
As a matter of fact , you yourselves often do not receive a cent in wages .
You yourselves do not have enough to eat or enough to wear , then how can you support your family ?
Your superior officers take you as their oxen and horses , as cannon fodder , and want you to risk your life in killing your own fraternal worker and peasant brothers so that they may be promoted in rank and become wealthy !
Fraternal soldiers !
You have got to think of a way out !
There is a way out for you .
It is revolution !
Now what you have in your hands are guns .
First of all , you kill your reactionary superior officers .
Then join efforts with the workers , peasants , and all other toiling people in your locality to topple the government of the Kuomintang , confiscate the land of the landlord class and distribute it among the poor peasants , seize the grain and dwellings of the rich and portion them out for the poor to live and to eat .
Make it so that workers labor for only 8 hours a day , and organize yourselves so that you manage your own affairs .
In this way you will have created a workers , peasants , and soldiers &apos; governmenti.e. , a Soviet Governmentand you all will have become a workers and peasants &apos; armed forcea workers and peasants &apos; Red Army .
If there is already a Soviet Government or a Red Army near your garrison , then you either catch your reactionary superior officers alive or kill them and go there and join the Red Army .
Only the Soviet Government , only the Red Army , can safeguard the interests of workers , peasants , and soldiers , overthrow the Kuomintang , overthrow imperialism , and truly protect our country and defend our people !
Fraternal soldiers !
Unite !
Turn round your guns and fight so as to overthrow imperialism and the Kuomintang , which are exploiting , oppressing , and massacring the toiling masses of China , and establish a Soviet Government and a Red Army of the workers , peasants , and soldiers !
Several hundred thousand fraternal soldiers of the Red Army welcome you to join our ranks !
Down with Imperialism and the Kuomintang !
Establish a Soviet Government of the Workers , Peasants , and Soldiers !
Long Live the Workers and Peasants &apos; Red Array !
Long Live the Victory of a Soviet Revolution in China !

RESOLUTION ON PROMULGATION OF PROVISIONAL TAX LAWADOPTED AT THE FIRST SESSION OF CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
28 November 1931
&#91; Test &#93; 1 .
Tax yields are a most important source of state revenue and expenditure .
In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution , the Central Government has abolished all land tax , poll tax , exorbitant taxes , miscellaneous levies , likin tax , etc .
of the Kuomintang warlords and put into effect a single progressive tax .
To any sector , a single progressive tax means that only one category of tax shall be levied .
The fundamental rule of tax collection is that apart from placing the burden of paying taxes on the exploiting class , the matter shall be resolved according to the principle of class .
The exploited class and people from the poorest strata shall be exempt from taxes .
At the present time , due to the revolutionary war , the Soviet areas all over the country are not contiguous to one another .
Because of this and many other special circumstances , agricultural tax can only be levied with the tax on staple products as a standard .
For the time being , the tax on all subsidiary products will not be imposed .
Also , agricultural tax is levied only from persons who produce more than enough to meet their necessary living expenses on a progressive scale .
All those who do not reach that standard will be exempt from taxes .
Taxes to be imposed on rich peasants will be comparatively heavy .
For them the standard for taxation will be lower by one @-@ half than that for poor peasants .
This fundamental rule is prescribed to enable the various provincial governments to determine the agricultural tax rates according to local actual conditions .
With a view to developing the economy in the Soviet areas at present , commercial export and import duty and industrial production tax will be dispensed with for the time being .
This Tax Law will be put into effect on 1 December 1931 .

RESOLUTION ON THE MARRIAGE LAWADOPTED AT THE FIRST SESSION OF CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
28 November 1931
&#91; Text &#93; Under the feudal rule the marriage system was so barbaric as to be inhuman .
The oppression and distress suffered by women were even worse than those by men .
Only when the workers &apos; and peasants1 revolution is won and men and women have attained primary emancipation economically will marriages unavoidably undergo changes and marriages based on freedom of choice be realized .
At present , marriages have acquired a foundation of freedom .
We should really establish a marriage system based on freedom of choice and abolish the feudal marriage system based on arbitrary and compulsory arrangements and on pecuniary considerations .
However , women who have just been emancipated from feudal oppression , have not yet recovered from the many serious injuries ( e.g. , bound feet ) to their bodies or achieved complete independence economically .
Hence , in the question of divorce , emphasis for the time being should be placed on the protection of the interests of women , leaving most of the obligations and responsibilities arising out of the divorce for the men to undertake .
Children are the masters of the new society .
Particularly in the old society , it was the custom not to pay heed to the caring of children .
Therefore , special stipulations are made for the protection of the interests of children .
This Law will be promulgated on 1 December 1931 and come into force immediately .

Mao Tse @-@ tung as Chairman and Hsiang Ying and Chang Kuo @-@ t &apos;ao as Vice @-@ chairmen of the Central Executive Committee .

At the same time , it set up the National Political Security Bureau under the People &apos;s Council with Teng Fa as Director .
The establishment of the Provisional Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic has been proclaimed .
From this day on , there are within Chinese territory two states that are diametrically opposite to each other .
One is the so @-@ called Republic of China .
It is a tool of imperialism and a state being used by warlords , bureaucrats , landlords , and the bourgeoisie to oppress workers , peasants , soldiers , and other toiling people , and the National Government of Chiang Kai @-@ shek and Wang Ching @-@ wei is the counterrevolutionary organ of political power of this state .
The other is the Chinese Soviet Republic , a state of the broad masses of exploited and oppressed workers , peasants , soldiers , and other toiling people .
Its banner is to down with imperialism , exterminate the landlord class , overthrow the Kuomintang warlord government , and set up a Soviet Government throughout the country , so as to strive for the interests of the several hundred million oppressed and exploited workers , peasants , soldiers , and other oppressed people , and for genuine peace and unity all over the country .
Its foundation is built upon the hopes and support of the several hundred million oppressed and exploited workers , peasants , soldiers , and poverty @-@ stricken people in the Soviet areas and non @-@ Soviet areas .
It possesses vast influence to deal a heavy blow to
the Kuomintang warlord government , such that it has caused the latter to step onto the road from disintegration to dissolution .
It must quickly score a victory in the revolution all over the country .
The Chinese Soviet Republic and the Central Executive Committee , accepting the trust of the National Congress , ought to spare no efforts to implement the political platform , Constitution , Labor Law , Land Law , and all other ordinances and resolutions drawn up by the Congress , establish a consolidated and extensive revolutionary base , create a massive Red Army , and organize a large @-@ scale revolutionary war , so as to gain an initial victory in the revolution in one or several provinces until a nation @-@ wide victory is won .
At a time when the Government is setting about its work , this notice is specially sent to workers , peasants , soldiers , poverty @-@ stricken people , and all oppressed people throughout the country for their information .

LAND LAW OF THE CHINESE SOVIET REPUBLIC--ADOPTED AT THE FIRST NATIONAL CONGRESS OF THE CHINESE ORKES @-@ PEASA13T @-@ SOLDIER SOVIET
1 December 1931
&#91; Text &#93; With each passing day the peasants &apos; struggle led by the proletariat is continuing to develop and grow stronger .
The soviet movement is cresting and continuing to expand despite the frenzied opposition of the imperialist warlords .
It is bringing about the self @-@ arming of the Chinese peasants , the organisation of the Red Army , and the liberation of peasants , in one county after another , from the several @-@ thousand @-@ year @-@ long oppression of the feudal landlords .
The land owned by these oppressors is being confiscated and distributed , the feudal system is being smashed , and the political power of the Kuomintang is being destroyed to establish the political power of the worker @-@ peasant @-@ soldier soviet .
This is the political power that can overthrow the imperialists and bring about agrarian revolution .
The first national congress of the Chinese worker @-@ peasant @-@ soldier soviet approved the confiscation of land held by landlords and other big private landowners and , in order to formulate a unified system of confiscation and distribution , it has proceeded from the basis of serving the basic interests &quot; of the peasant masses and the future of the revolution &apos;s development to adopt the following land law as the best guaranty for solving the land question .
Article 1 .
Regardless of whether they are leased out or self @-@ farmed , land belonging to all feudal landlords , evil gentry , warlords , bureaucrats , and big , private landowners are to be confiscated with no compensation .
The confiscated land will be distributed by the poor and middle peasants through the soviet , and the original owners will have no right to participate in the distribution .
Hired help , coolies , laborers and farmers , regardless of sex , all have jurisdiction over land distribution .
With the approval of the peasant masses , the unemployed independent laborers in the townships and villages will also have similar right to distribution .
The aged and the feeble , the lame , and the widows who are unable to engage in labor and who have no family members to provide them with support should be given social assistance by the government of the soviet or handled separately after the distribution of the land *
Article 2 .
The Red Army members are advanced fighters -who support the political power of the soviet and the overthrow of imperialism , and land must be distributed to them , regardless of whether a soviet has been established in their base areas or -whether their areas are still under reactionary rule .
And the soviet government will seek means to have this land farmed on their behalf .
Article 3-
As the rich peasants of China have the characteristics of semi @-@ landlords or usurers , their land should also be confiscated , whereas the land of the middle peasant class will not be confiscated .
The rich peasants can &quot; be given some comparatively poor &quot; land distributed for labor . &quot; However , there is one condition , and that is this land must be farmed by their own labor .
Article k .
Confiscate the land and assets of all organizers of counterrevolution , organizers of armed columns of the White army , and active participants of counterrevolution .
However , exceptions may be made of poor and middle peasants who oppose the soviet not of their own volition taut by being lured into it , and found by the local soviet to be exemptable from prosecution , but their leaders will be prosecuted unconditionally in accordance with the law .
Article 5-
The first national congress found that the most thorough of all measures to be taken to wipe out all vestiges of feudalism and slavery and to get away from the private ownership rights of landlords is the equitable distribution of all land .
However , under no circumstances should the local soviet government implement this through force or by fiat .
This measure must be explained to the peasants in a comprehensive manner , and it can be carried out only on the foundation of willingness from the basic peasantry and with their direct support .
When the majority of the middle peasants is unwilling , they may abstain from participation in the equal distribution of land .
Article 6 .
The soviet government must assiduously strive to turn over to the peasants all shrines , temples , and other public land unconditionally .
But , at the time of implementation and handling , the willing support of the peasantry must be obtained on the general principle of not interferring with their religious sentiments .
Article 7 .
Should the more opulent farmers attempt to distribute confiscated land on the basis of means of production . , it must be sternly stopped as such attempts have
been found by the First Congress to be deliberate attempts to enrich themselves and impede the development of agrarian revolution .
In accordance with the local conditions in the villages , the local soviet will select a principle that will serve the best interests of the poor arid middle peasants and base the distribution of land on it , or on the basis of availability or scarcity of labor in each family and the size of the family , or , again , distribute equally in accordance with the population count of middle and poor peasants and tenant farmers .
Distribution to rich peasants will be made on the basis of available labor units ( i.e. , in the areas where land is distributed equally on the basis of population distributed land received by rich peasants with available labor should be equal to the land received by each individual under the principle of equal distribution in accordance &quot; with populace ) with population as a supporting factor .
In distributing land , not only is the area of the land but , also , the quality ( especially in the form of yields ) to be considered .
Agrarian reform should also be carried out by all means possible and suitably at the time of land distribution as a step toward whiping out all vestiges of feudalism such as narrow mindedness , one @-@ sidedness , and large ( ownership of ? ) farm lands .
Article 8 .
Estates and liquid assets of all feudal lords , warlords , landlords , and evil gentry , their houses , storehouses , livestock , and farm implements are to be confiscated .
After the land has been distributed to the rich peasants , remaining houses , farm implements , livestock , water pumps , and oil extracting machines are to be confiscated .
The confiscated houses are to be distributed on the basis of the interests of middle and poor peasants and through the local Soviets , to the poor and middle peasants and through the local Soviets , to the poor and middle peasants who are homeless for residential purposes , and some of these houses are to be allocated for use as schools and clubs , by the committees of local Soviets , of the party , and of the youth league , and by the red trade unions , poor peasants groups , and various organizations and agencies , livestock and agricultural implements may be distributed to each family or to groups of poor and middle peasants .
In accordance with the wishes of the peasantry , the various confiscated agricultural tools can be utilised as the preliminary step to forming cooperatives , or through the suggestion of the peasantry , and with the concurrance of the soviet , they can be used to establish a livestock @-@ agricultural implement administrative office to provide the poor and .
middle peasants with these things for use in .
their farming work .
The administrative office should be managed by the local soviet , the peasants should pay rentals at a fixed rate , and all repairs of agricultural tools and implements and the subsidizing of the administrative office &apos;s workers , as well as the procurement of new tools and livestock should be reimbursed &quot; by the peasants at a certain percentage of the expenditures .
Article 9 .
While the assets and the land of landlords and evil gentry are being confiscated , all verbal and written agreements on tenancy rents must be wiped out ,
erasing all obligations and debts to these assets and land , and also proclaim null and void all debts and usury ( debts ) .
All agreements between former landlords and peasants for voluntary return and reimbursement should &quot; be strictly prohibited by revolutionary law . , and the peasants should not be allowed to return in part the land once owned by the landlords and evil gentry or partially reimburse the debts owed them .
Article 10 .
All water conservancy works , rivers , lakes , streams , timberland , pastures , and large , wooded mountains are to be managed by the soviet and construction carried out which will facilitate public use of these resources by poor and middle peasants .
In accordance with the wishes of the local peasantry , mulberry groves , bamboo groves , tea hills , and fish ponds are to be allocated to them for use in the same way as paddy or wheat fields .
Article 11 .
For the concrete and thorough realization of the benefits of agrarian reform , the First National Congress of the Chinese Worker @-@ Peasant @-@ Soldier Soviet has proclaimed the tenant farmers &apos; union , the manual laborer &apos;s union , the poor peasants group , are necessary groups , and viewed these organizations as the pillars of the soviet implementation of agrarian revolution .
Article 12 .
The First National Congress of the Chinese Worker @-@ Peasant @-@ Soldier Soviet holds that under the political rule of the Soviet the nationalization of land and water conservancy works is a necessary step toward the thorough elimination of all feudal relationships in the rural areas , which is , in fact , to bring about a surging , rapid development of the rural economy .
However , the actual implementation of this measure will be possible only under the condition that the agrarian revolution is victorious in the crucial areas of China , and there is basic support of nationalisation by the peasant masses .
At this stage of the revolution , the soviet government should explain to the peasants the benefits to be derived from the nationalization of land and water conservancy works . &quot; But , at present , the buying and selling of land , and the leasing of it are not prohibited .
However , the soviet government should , at the same time , strictly prohibit speculative activities of the rich peasants in buying back their original land from the land owner .
Article 13-
If the situation is favorable , the local soviet is to operate the following enterprises : 1 .
land reclamation ; 2 .
handling of population relocation ; 3 .
building new and improvign existing drainage and irrigation systems ; U.
planting forests ; 5 * speeding up construction of roads and enterprises to impel the development of the rural economy .
Article I3 !
,
This law is applicable not only in current soviet areas , but also in non @-@ soviet areas and areas where soviet power had &quot; been newly established .
If the .
land already distributed in the various soviet areas conform with this law , it will remain as it is , &quot; but those not conforming to this law should be redistributed ,

ECONOMIC POLICY OF THE CHINESE SOVIET REPUBLIC 1 December 1931
&#91; Text &#93; For the development of agrarian revolution and anti @-@ imperialism , and for the consolidation of the revolutionary union of workers and peasants , the First National Congress of the Chinese Worker @-@ Peasant @-@ Soldier Soviet sets forth the following articles as the &quot; basis of the current economic policy of the soviet .
Industry
To ensure a completely independent government of the soviet , all economic life lines in the hands of imperialism ( such as concessions , customs , banks , railroads , navigation , mines , and factories ) are to be nationalized .
Lend @-@ lease contracts will be re @-@ negotiated on some foreign business enterprises currently being allowed to operate and production will continue .
However , they must abide by all the laws of the soviet , implement an 8 @-@ hour work day system and carry out various other regulations .
Should the owners of these enterprises contravene these conditions , engage in work slow @-@ downs , shut down the enterprise , or interfere in the domestic affairs of the soviet government and support the counterrevolution , then the enterprises are to be immediately confiscated and nationalized .
With regard to business enterprises and handicraft industries run by Chinese capitalists , the soviet will not nationalize them , but allow them to remain in the hands of their original owners .
However , they will be operated under the supervision of workers , the factory committee and the trade union .
But , should the owners of these business enterprises slow down production , sabotage the laws of the soviet , or participate in such counterrevolutionary activities as deliberately sabotaging or slowing down production , these business enterprises will be confiscated immediately and , in accordance with concrete conditions , handed over to the workers labor cooperative or the soviet government to manage .
3- Strive strenuously to further the development of industry .
The soviet government pays special attention to ensuring the development of all business enterprises that supply the Red Army ( factories , workshops , handicraft industries , home enterprises , etc . ) .
Commerce
The soviet should guarantee freedom of commerce .
It should not interfere with the routine workings of the commodity market .
But the soviet must strictly prohibit such speculative activities by businessmen as the raising of prices .
It should disband chambers of commerce and prohibit big and small merchants from monopolizing prices in the name of the chamber of commerce .
Should it discover sabotage or economic blockage by businessmen , thereby endangering the supply of &quot; basic daily necessities needed by the masses , or because of Red Army needs , the soviet government should set price ceilings on basic commodities .
These measures are to be taken only when they are necessary , and , when it &quot; becomes possible . , freedom of commerce is to be restored .
In trade with non @-@ soviet areas , &quot; monopoly of foreign trade &quot; absolutely cannot be implemented as yet , but , at the same time , the soviet government should supervise such trade in order to ensure a supply of basic necessity commodities to the soviet area .
The outflow of currency must have the permission of the soviet ,
3- For the trade of the entire soviet area and to ensure the interests of the working poor and to improve the supply of necessary commodities to the masses , the soviet must extend all @-@ out assistance to the organization and development of consumer cooperatives .
The soviet should give financial aid and grant tax exemptions to cooperatives , and it should turn over in part some of the buildings and shops that were confiscated for the use of the cooperatives .
Moreover , in order to guarantee supply to the laboring masses , the government should promote public warehouses to store food grains so as to be able to give aid to the masses or sell the grains to them at a low price .
Finance and Revenue Laws
Wipe out the entire tax system of the warlord government of the Kuomintang and its unlawful levies , the soviet will promulgate a unified progressive tax so that the burden will fall , instead , on the capitalists .
The soviet government should exempt from taxation the Red Army , workers , and families of the poor in urban and rural areas .
In cases of unforeseen disasters . , taxes should either be remitted or reduced .
Negate all past verbal and written agreements of slavery and usury , void all usurious obligations of peasants and the poor of the cities , prohibit anticipatory taxation or debtor &apos;s bondage .
The revolutionary laws should be applied so as to strictly guard against , and also prevent , all attempts to restore relations between usury and slavery .
All items pawned by the urban and rural poor are to be returned to their original owners without compensation , and the pawnshops are to be turned over to the soviet .
3- Old currency notes , for the present , are to be permitted to circulate in the soviet areas , but market differences must be eliminated .
However , these old currency notes must be given scrutiny and verification to .. facilitate
supervision .
The soviet should issue its own currency notes and exchange them for the old , and , at first , the old currency notes may &quot; be kept in circulation vith the addition of a stamped marking .
All currency notes from other areas must be exchanged for the soviet notes or the stamped currency notes .
As a step toward helping all the working poor and to implement a uniform currency system . , the soviet should establish a Worker @-@ Peasant Bank and open branches in the various areas of the soviet .
This bank has the special authority to print currency .
It will process loans to people engaged in peasant family enterprises , and to cooperatives and small businessmen for economic development .
It shall carry out currency exchange , and its branches will , in addition , act as the taxing agency .
5- The soviet should dispatch representatives to keep an eye on the activities of this bank and all other big , privately owned banks and money changers , and prohibit them from issuing any kind of currency .
The soviet shall strictly prohibit all attempts by bankers to utilise local banks and engage in counterrevolutionary activities .
Municipal Administration
Necessary adjustments should be made by the soviet to lighten the rent burden of the urban poor .
The houses and assets of landlords , despotic gentry , warlords , bureaucrats and politicians are to be confiscated , the houses are to be turned over to workers , laborers , and apprentices for residential purposes , and the assets are to be divided by the urban poor or applied to public enterprises by the soviet .
The urban soviet should utilize all means to improve the housing conditions of the poor .

CIRCULAR FOR THE ARREST OF KU SHIM @-@ CHANG , TRAITOR TO THE REVOLUTION
Unnumbered directive of the People &apos;s Committee of the Provisional Soviet Central Government .
10 December 1931
&#91; Text &#93; To the various levels of soviet government in the provinces , counties , districts - and villages of the soviet areas and the Red Guards units of the Red Army and the broad working masses of workers and peasants :
To the workers and peasants in the areas under White rule and all oppressed masses :
When he was arrested by the counterrevolutionary investigative units of the Kuomintang in Hankow on 25 April 1931 ?
the renegade Ku Shun @-@ chang ( also known as Li Ming &#91; 27 ^ 6 2 ^ &#93; , originally called Ku Feng @-@ ming &#91; 7357 7361 !
? 686 &#93; and has gone under the aliases of Hua Kuang Chi Ni Shu Shih &#91; 0553 l6 &amp; 11 ^ 2 778 5880 15971- About 27 or 28 , native of Wu Sung &#91; 0702 26 ^ 6 &#93; , Shanghai ; short in build with bulging eyes and prominent nose ) immediately capitulated to the reactionary regime and revealed the existence of the multi @-@ county soviet government of western Kwangtung Province a communication complex of the Chinese Communist Party located in Wuhan office of the Red Second Army Corps .
This resulted in a sweep and the caputre of a dozen or so revolutionary fighters who were all murdered out of hand by the Wuhan reactionary government later .
He even revealed a worker on a steamship plying the river who was sympathetic to the revolution and of whose existence he alone knew , thereby sending the worker into the prisons of the counterrevolutionaries .
With such a bloody price and the assurance it brought him to back him up he repeatedly cabled Nanking requesting a personal meeting with Chiang Kai @-@ shek , and upon arrival in Nanking , he not only secretly reported to the Kuomintang counterrevolutionaries about the organizational set @-@ ups and activities of the Chinese Communist Party } the soviet government , the Red Army , and all revolutionary groups of worker @-@ peasant masses , he also identified Tun Tai @-@ ying &#91; 1926 0108 5391 &#93; &gt; a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and a national leader of revolutionary youths , who had already been sentenced to prison by the Hanking government with other comrades .
All of them were immediately shot by the counterrevolutionaries .
At the same time he disclosed the five residential locations
of Chou En @-@ lai , Chu Chiu @-@ pai &#91; ^ 23 ^ ^ 28 lHOl &#93; , Li Wei @-@ han &#91; 2621 1 * 850 3352 &#93; and other members and leaders of the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s Central Corn @-@ mi ttee , &quot; whom he had come to know while he was in Shanghai , to the counterrevolutionaries .
Orders were immediately cabled to the Shanghai Bureau of Public Safety and , in coordination with imperialist police , raids were carried out at the residences of each of the individuals .
Fortunately , these comrades had already left Shanghai at that time and escaped harm .
Following this , he repeatedly sent relatives and household members to Shanghai and , using what knowledge he had , investigated the whereabouts of the Chinese Communist Party organization and revolutionary groups and their leaders .
Unfortunately , it was in this net that he had spread that Comrade Hsiang Chung @-@ fa &#91; 0686 1813 ^ 099 &#93; , General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party , was taken and killed .
This became the greatest contribution made by Ku Shun @-@ chang in his betrayal of the revolution and capitulation to counterrevolution .
Thenceforth , Ku Shun @-@ chang gradually became an Important official in the K K assassination organization of Chiang Kai @-@ shek .
He became an assassin for Chiang Kai @-@ shek in the company of such counterrevolutionary criminals as Ch &apos;en Kuo @-@ fu &#91; 7115 265 ^ 1133 &#93; , Ch &apos;en Li @-@ fu &#91; 7115 ^ 539 11331 , Hsu En &#91; 1176 1869 &#93; , and Tseng Chang @-@ fu &#91; 2582 225 ^ 5706 &#93; .
In spite of the fact that the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary mass organizations are under extremely difficult conditions of White terror , their organizations have become even more consolidated and tightly knit with the help of the support given by the revolutionary masses , the recent victories won by the Red Army in the soviet areas , the founding of the Provisional Soviet Central Government , and the upsurge of the anti @-@ Kuomintang , anti- &apos; imperialist struggle waged by the worker @-@ peasant working masses in White dominated areas .
They are even more determinedly leading the worker @-@ peasant masses to rally around the soviet banners and carry on the struggle .
Therefore , the venomous plans of renegade Ku Shun @-@ chang to wipe out the revolutionary organisations and revolutionary leaders were not successful .
This , therefore , lead to changes In tactics , and baldfaced charges were made to slander our revolutionary comrade leaders and the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and make them out as murderers in an attempt to use this vicious stratagem to destroy the trust the masses have in the Chinese Communist Party and its leaders .
In an even more despicable move , Ku Shun @-@ chang himself published notices in the newspapers calling for the arrest of Comrade Chou En @-@ lai and other leading members of the Chinese Communist Party .
He also declared that he had never harmed anyone in the Communist Party , and he had been sequestered in scholarly pursuits in his home .
Such shameless denials can never cover up the bloody havoc wrought upon the revolution by his viciously cruel and poisonous hands .
This is obvious to everyone in the revolutionary masses .
As for arrest warrants , it is not necessary to wait for renegade Ku Shun @-@ changrs notices in the newspapers .
Every revolutionary fighter and the worker peasant masses will have their names on the wanted list of the counterrevolutionaries when they physically take part in the revolution , and their lives are forfeit if captured .
Class animosity has reached the stage of struggle to the death , because &apos; those that the Kuomintang wanted the counterrevolutionaries to arrest are those the broad working masses of workers and peasants -want to support .
Anyway , such cruel and fiendish renegades as Ku Shun @-@ chang are abetted by the Kuomintang counterrevolutionaries , and they are precisely the ones the working masses of workers and peasants want to wipe out .
Landlords , bourgeoisie , Kuomintang warlords , and bureaucrats are the kind of people the counterrevolutionaries are dependent upon , and they are now at the end of their tether .
Whereas those who take part in the revolution , and those who support it , are the extremely broad masses of workers , peasants , the poor of the urban areas , and all oppressed people .
And the victorious government of the soviet and the Chinese Communist Party are leading them to wrest nationwide victory for the revolution .
The high tide of revolution is continuing to crest , and the 200,000 to 300,000 soldiers of the Kuomintang have been defeated time and again by the worker peasant Red Army , with the Eed Army encountering very little resistance from them .
So how can one Ku Shun @-@ chang and the Chiang Kai @-@ shek killer organisation , the K K group , destroy the revolution ?
On the contrary , they will be drowned in the huge waves &quot; of the revolutionl
For this purpose ^ the Provisional Soviet Central Government issues a special order to the various levels of soviet government , the Red Army , and the Red Guards of various areas , and also proclaims to the working masses of workers and peasants throughout the country to be on special alert against the devious machinations of the Kuomintang counterrevolutionaries and , with one mind , endeavor to capture this renegade , - Ku Shun @-@ chang .
If this renegade is found in the soviet areas , he is to be captured and handed over to a revolutionary court to stand trial .
If he should be encountered in areas under White rule , every revolutionary fighter , every worker , peasant . , or the poor has the duty to eliminate him .
The capture and destruction of this renegade Ku Shun @-@ chang is a conscious and glorious duty of every revolutionary fighter and of the worker @-@ peasant masses .
Such methods as rewards and bribery used by landlords , capitalists , and running dogs of counterrevolution cannot be used to &apos; insult us , the exploited and oppressed masses .
-The broad worker peasant masses &apos; .
Consolidate your fronts and strive with one accord for the capture of Ku Shun @-@ chang I
Spread the revolutionary struggle and thoroughly eradicate Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s killer organization , the K KJ

&#91; Text &#93; Dear Beloved -workers , peasants , soldiers and revolutionary students I The Kuomintang reactionary government is once more engaging in new secret deals to &quot; betrayChina , the Chinese national interests , and .
the Chinese people .
According to the news in the papers : The Kuomintang government has reorganized the setting up of a neutral zone in Chin @-@ chou , has proposed the organising of international control of Tientsin and has recognised all previous secret treaties betraying the country and the national interests .
Brothers and sisters !
Do you all understand what this means ?
It means that tens of thousands of li of territory in Manchuria and several tens of millions of people are irrevocably lost to Japanese imperialism and for them to trample upon I It means that Chin @-@ chou and Tienstsin are to be presented on a platter to international imperialism and for them to despoil , and it is to put heavy chains and shackles on the ^ 00 million people of China so that generation upon generation of our children will be forever subjugated to the oppression and exploitation of Japanese and International imperialism and &quot; become slaves without a county !
Brothers and sisters !
This is unprecedented and shocking news of plotting to &quot; betray the nation , but the reactionary ruling class is clamoring such lies as &quot; revolutionary diplomacy , &quot; final preparations , &quot; and &apos; &apos; march north to recover lost territory . &quot; This is truly the most shameless plot ever hatched under the sun !
Brothers !
Sisters !
Can we allow the reactionary rule to connive freely with imperialism to carve us up like sheep ?
Can we watch our land &quot; being forcefully taken away by Japanese imperialism ?
Can we endure the cruelest kind of oppression , slaughter , and humiliation suffered by slaves in the colonies ?
Can we silently watch our own brothers being whipped , killed , and slaughtered ?
Can we unfeelingly watch our sisters being molested , insulted , and raped ?
No !
No I Ten thousand times no !
We must rise in unison to oppose , oppose the aggression of Japanese and international imperialism , oppose the shameless capitulation of the Kuomintang rulers , to imperialism , and its betrayal of China !
Go on
strike , boycott classes . , and stop work !
Seize the weapons of the reactionaries to arm ourselves and let us all strive to drive out Japanese imperialism and overthrow the running dogs of imperialismthe Kuomintang !
Brothersl Sisters !
Can we still have any illusions and hopes for the Kuomintang rule ?
The1 Kuomintang rule has brought year after year of famine without end , caused tens of millions of the working masses to live a life of suffering , homeless , destitute , hungry , and cold , turned millions of jobless workers in the streets with no means of livelihood , fomented endless wars of the warlords which resulted in the death of tens of thousands of soldiers , whose bones lie scattered in the wilderness , made orphans and widows homeless , manufactured countless tragic incidents and secret treaties undermining national interests and humiliating the nation , and caused China to fall under the iron heel of imperialism with no hope of emancipation .
Can we have one more minute of patience with , the reactionary rule whose crimes stink to high heavens ?
No , no , ten thousand times no I What should we do , then ?
We should all rise as one and topple this reactionary rule of the Kuomintang !
Organize and unite , prepare our forces and weapons , and carry out armed uprisings to overthrow the Kuomintang rule and establish a people &apos;s own government !
Carry out a war of anti @-@ imperialism and national liberation under the leadership of our own political political power !
Brothersl Sisters !
Can we be victorious over Japanese and international imperialisms &quot; after we overthrow the reactionary rule and organized our own political power to fight a revolutionary war ?
Can we smash the well @-@ trained and well @-@ supported troops of imperialism ?
Yes , yes , ten thousand times yes !
After h years of massive war , the bone @-@ weary worker and peasant masses of Russia relied on their own power and the leadership of the Bolsheviks to smash the allied army of lk nations .
And so can we .
The unity of tens of millions of people is a force that is superior than all the planes and artillery of the imperialists , and , what is more , we have the proletariat of the world , the oppressed slaves of the colonies , and the USSR , which occupies one @-@ sixth of the world , on our side .
Rise up , overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang , establish our own government , and wage a bloody war to the death with imperialism !
Brothers &apos; .
Sisters !
The Provisional Central Soviet Government announces to you : The soviet government is the only revolutionary government that opposes imperialism to the end .
With the objective to achieve the complete independence and liberation of the Chinese nation , we oppose all open and secret unequal treaties between the reactionary government of China and imperialism ; we oppose secret diplomacy ; we propose the ousting of all land , sea , and air forces of imperialism from China ; we propose the confiscation of all banks , mines , railways , and enterprises of imperialism in China ; we deny all foreign debts ; we regard the Kuomintang governments in Nanking and Kwangtung as no different from the traitorous government of landlords and the capitalist class , and they have no right whatsoever to represent the working masses of China .
The soviet government holds that all negotiations and agreements between them and imperialism are null and void .
ith regard to the Manchuria incident , we
propose the Immediate and unconditional pull @-@ out of all Japanese troops from China , abrogate all Sino @-@ Japanese treaties , confiscate all Japanese banksj mines , railways , and business enterprises in China , recover all foreign concessions , abolish consular jurisdictional rights , and draft new and equal treaties with due respect to the independence and freedom of Soviet China .
Otherwise , we shall carry out a resolute war of national liberation against the Japanese imperialists .
However , in order to attain the independence and liberation of the Chinese nation , in order to carry out the war of national liberation and achieving victory , it is necessary to first of all overthrow the traitorous , counterrevolutionary Kuomintang government , the betrayer of Chinese national interests , and establish a soviet type democratic dictatorship of workers and peasants over the entire country !
Brothers !
Sisters !
Imperialist aggression is becoming more and more ruthless , &quot; the national betrayal of the Kuomintang is becoming more despicable day by day , and the sufferings of the working masses have become more and more unbearable !
Rise up , the working masses of the entire nation , unite , organize , and arm to fight a decisive battle with imperialism and with the Kuomintang !
Rally around the banner of the soviet and wipe out the counterrevolutionary rule of the Kuomintang with the worker @-@ peasant revolution , overthrow the semi @-@ colonial type of rule of imperialism in China , and achieve the freedom and liberation of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people !
Oppose imperialism and oppose the oppression and the butchering of the anti @-@ imperialist movement by the Kuomintang with strikes , school boycotts , and work stoppages !
Arm the masses and drive out Japanese imperialism !
Abrogate all negotiations and secret treaties between the Kuomintang and imperialism !
Overthrow the counterrevolutionary rule of the Kuomintang1 Down with imperialism !
Support the Provisional Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic--the Chinese people &apos;s own government !
Support the Red Armythe Chinese people &apos;s own , and the only armed force that opposes imperialism to the endl
Long live the independence and liberation of the Chinese nation !
Long live Soviet China !

IMPORTANT DIRECTIVE ON CONSTRUCTION OF THE SOVIET 15 December 1931
&#91; Text &#93; In the past , the organization of the various levels of the Soviet has &quot; been poorly structured .
First . , administrative areas were too large to facilitate administration ; second , too many levels of government slowed the flow of directives and caused poor liaison ; and , third , of special importance is the fact that election procedures -were not comprehensive .
The election of various levels of government was done either by simply calling mass meetings or by convening representatives meetings or joint conferences of chairmen without passing through the various stages of the election process .
Especially the basic organization of the sovietthe urban and rural Sovietshad not been truly established .
Fourth , the division of labor and the work procedures within the various levels of government were , on the whole , unsuitable .
All of the above contradicted the constitution of the soviet and the laws and regulation of the central government .
The provisional central government now announces that the county government in the various areas must begin anew to delimit administrative areas and reorganise the various levels of government in accordance with the constitution and the provisional laws and regulations proclaimed by the central government .
First in importance is the re @-@ demarcation of ( administrative ) areas and villages ( abolishing hamlets and small units ) in accordance with the provisional regulations governing the delimiting of administrative areas .
Next is the election of village and town Soviets ( these are the basic organizations of the soviet ) in accordance with the election process , and then , in accordance with the provisional laws and regulations governing the organization of local governments , reconstruct the entire structure of the soviet from the village and town levels to the provincial soviet .
This is a task of the utmost importance and every level of local government must , with the greatest determination and with all its power , , carefully and meticulously carry it out .
Only by so doing will we be able to avoid having the re @-@ delimited administrative areas become as full of faults and riddled with imperfections as the former ones were , and only thus can the various newly reorganized levels of government avoid becoming like the old .
If such weaknesses are to be eliminated the various provincial governments must exert their greatest efforts in directing this movement to construct the local Soviets .
Besides giving instructions the issuance of various notices with detailed specifics , conferences of
persons with principal responsibilities in the two levels of county and administrative area governments are to be convened at local sites and provincial locations .
Then , select a suitable &#91; deletion &#93; to call a meeting of persons with principal responsibilities in the various village governments , with the provincial and county governments dispatching personnel to direct these meetings and discuss clearly and in detail the significance of the soviet construction movement and the practical ways to carry it out .
Moreover , , the leadership must dispatch personnel to various counties to inspect when the actual delimiting of administrative areas and reelection of governments are in progress in order to resolve difficulties and problems and correct errors as they arise .
The direction of administrative areas by county , and village by administrative area , should follow this procedure .
It is imperative to achieve excellent results in this current movement of soviet construction .
The two provinces of Kiangsi and Fukien , and the affiliated county of Jui @-@ ching , have set the period beginning from 20 December 1931 &quot; to 31 March 1932 as the period for the movement of constructing Soviets in accordance with the new laws .
The Soviets of these two provinces arid of Jui @-@ ching county , should immediately draw up suitable work schedule during this set period to enable the re @-@ delimiting of administrative areas and election of various level Soviets to be accomplished in a planned and successful manner within period of 100 days ( the delimiting and election of the first level of village will consume a major portion of the effort and time ) , as well as keeping the central government constantly informed of what has transpired so that it can give timely directions .
The other provinces are to implement as of date of receipt of this directive .

PRACTICAL MEASURES FOR CARRYING OUT REGULATIONS GOVERNING PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT FOR RED ARM MEMBERS
Directive No 9 ^ the Executive Committee 1 February 1932
&#91; Text &#93; The First National Congress of the Chinese Worker @-@ Peasant @-@ Soldier Congress passed the regulations governing preferential treatment for Red Army members .
These regulations on preferential treatment have set forth many superior privileges for the Red Army members .
Why so many superior conditions have to he regulated for the Red Army members ?
Because , in the past several years of struggle , the Red Army has &quot; been the main force in the resolute implementation of agrarian revolution , the determined opposition against imperialism , and against the Kuomintang warlords , and it is a powerful defender of the soviet government .
In the past history of the revolutionary struggles of China it has a glorious record of heroic struggles .
Presently , the Chinese revolution is in an environment of savage revolutionary warfare and it is in a period of actively carrying out this revolutionary warfare , to wage even more ferocious warfare against the imperialist Kuomintang warlords .
To first achieve victory in one or several provinces , and then victory throughout the nation , there must be a massive Red Army .
The Red Army fights for the liberation of workers , peasants , and all oppressed people .
They are fighters who do battle for the soviet political power . , struggle for the liberation and the interests of workers and peasants and all oppressed people with the greatest spirit of sacrifice .
Therefore , the soviet government and the worker @-@ peasant masses should naturally give special preferential treatment to the Red Army members so that these fighters will feel assured and will not worry about their families , thereby enabling them to concentrate wholly on fighting bravely .
For this reason the First National Congress specially set forth these regulations governing the preferential treatment of Red Army members .
In the past , the various local Soviets have certainly set forth certain regulations governing the preferential treatment of Red Army members and their families .
However , in their actual implementation , there was a lack of attention and care , and , in some areas , outright neglect or no implementation at all .
That was tantamount to sabotaging the Red Army and created a great obstacle to the expansion of the Red Army and the strengthening of its combat
effectiveness .
This is a major error .
From now on all levels of soviet government should strictly rectify the errors of the past , and absolutely ensure the carrying out of the regulations passed by the All Soviets Congress on preferential treatment of Red Array members .
Henceforth . , should there again be neglect in giving preferential treatment to the Red Army members , or there is a dragging of feet in the implementation of regulations governing the preferential treatment of Red Army members , it will be punished in a similar manner as for counterrevolution .
Therefore , the following practical measures for the implementation of the regulations governing preferential treatment of Red Army members are set forth to facilitate putting them into effect .
With the areas as the unit , immediately investigate who have become members of the Red Army , the number of people in the families of these members , how much land they have , how many labor effectives they possess , who lack , or have inadequate , labor , total them up and make two copies , retaining.one for reference and one to be turned over to the county soviet for record .
This task is to be completed as of 1 March .
The political departments and political commissars of the various armies of the Red Army and its independent divisions ^ as well as local armed forces divorced from production , will &quot; be responsible for detailed registration of all commanders , fighters , and workers by name , age , domicile , , and family situation , and report them to the revolutionary military commission or the local soviet government .
This task is also deadlined for completion before 1 March .
The local government and the political department and commissars of the Red Army will investigate to the best of their ability those fighters of the Red Army already sacrificed , and report to the revolutionary military committee or the local soviet government so as to have the county governments take action .
^ - .
The responsible persons of various armies and local armed force units will investigate and differentiate by class composition , or by the principal or support roles played by those in the Red Army or local armed forces who have , in the past , participated in counterrevolutionary organizations regardless of whether they are those who have &quot; been sentenced or who have confessed , reformed , and remained in the units , and report them to higher echelon organizations so that decisions could be made on whether their land should , or should not be , confiscated and these decisions turned over to the various local governments for implementation after decisions have been reached in these cases .
Except for Red Army fighters with foreign domicile , the registration ledgers of the various armies are to be forwarded by the Central Government to the various area governments .
They , in turn , will compare the name lists of the various army units with their own and report the result to their own higher level of government for record .
If there are discrepancies , they , are still required to be examined carefully and reported to the higher level government for review so as to avoid omissions or errors .
The current important problem on the implementation of the regulations governing preferential treatment is the mobilising of the masses to help the families of Red Army members cultivate their land and to farm public land half for the Red Army .
This should be done by the area and village government in accordance with the compiled name lists , totalling up the number of Red Army member families with no labor or have inadequate labor force , and calculate the amount of voluntary labor needed .
Then total how much labor force is available in the various villages of the entire area and , accordingly , allocate the worker @-@ peasant masses of a certain area to help the families of that area in farming their land and to cultivate the public land of the Red Army .
The village Soviets are assigned this responsibility and practical allocations are to be made and cultivation carried out by them .
After receipt of notice from the area soviet , the various village Soviets are to immediately call a meeting of the village soviet and decide upon the method of implementation .
Then call the families of Red Army members and the entire populace of the village to a meeting to discuss and publicize the significance of assisting families of Red Army members in farming their land and the cultivation of public land of the Red Army , and the number of voluntary labor force the village is obligated to provide .
After the masses have approved , allocate the number of days of voluntary labor and the schedule in a practical manner .
At the same time , the village soviet should also , do their best to convene a meeting of responsible persons of poor peasant groups and tenant farmer union and request their help in mobilizing the masses to carry out the cultivation of public lands held by the Red Army and extend assistance to families of Red Army members in the farming of their land .
The village soviet will be responsible for the supervision at cultivation and harvesting periods and , at the same time , it must guard against giving coercive orders ( the rich peasants are exceptions ) .
At the time of cultivation and at harvesting period the village soviet will apply the methods of propaganda and encouragement to mobilize the broad masses before they take place and assist the Red Army and the families of Red Army members in these tasks based the voluntary labor force assigned , thereby completing the cultivation and the harvesting of Red Army fields somewhat ahead of the others .
9- Regarding measures for retaining public land for Red Army fighters of foreign domicile , they should be in accordance with how much land has been distributed to each person in that area and .
the stipulated quota of public land set aside .
This quota will be large or small in accordance with the land distributed .
For example , the method set up by Kiangsi Province is to allocate public paddies for three to five people in villages where the per person distribution is 5 tan , and more for those villages with distribution exceeding 5 tan .
Those villages distributing less than 5 tan per person should also allocate public paddies for at least two persons .
The other soviet areas may allocate in a manner similar to Kiangsi1s method .
Besides
the necessity for old soviet areas to take measures for allocating public paddies . , all newly developed areas must give their special attention to setting aside of public paddies when land is distributed .
With the administrative area as a unit all public paddies in the area are to &quot; be totalled and reported to the county and then to the provincial governments , A report on the total amount of public paddies in the entire province is then made to the Central Government .
The General Political Department of the Red Army will then distribute the public paddies available in the .. various counties in accordance with the number of persons with foreign domiciles in the Red Array .
While reporting this , on the one hand , to the Central Government for forwarding to local governments for announcement to the masses , on the other hand announcements will also be made to the fighters of various army units on how much public land have been newly allocated and their locations .
The fighters of the various units will then elect representatives to inspect the allocated paddies at these locations .
Special markings should be set up by the area government on the public paddies in various areas with the notation that it is the public paddies of fighters of a certain army unit .
Regarding such items as seeds and fertilizers , they will be mainly supplied by mobilizing the masses , and , when possible , the government will provide additional support .
After the harvest each year the area soviet will be responsible for selling the harvested products and changing them into currency .
This will then be forwarded to the county government , and the provincial government will hand the currency over to the Red Army for distribution to the person enjoying the privilege of the public paddies .
13- The names , domiciles , and families of Red Army fighters with foreign domicile who have sacrificed their lives should be registered so that when the revolution developed to that area at a future date the Central Government will issue orders to the local government to investigate and certify in accordance with the addresses and give preferential treatment to their families in accordance with these regulations .
lU .
If3 after the death of a Red Army fighter , his family has inadequate means , or no means at all , to maintain a livelihood , - the government should give a financial subsidy in accordance with the living expense needs of the area until his children become self @-@ supporting , or until the death of parents and spouse where there are no issues ,
The children of Red Army members have the right to free tuition in areas where schools have been established .
The village and area Soviets will be responsible for carrying this out .
Red Army fighters and their families enjoy special privileges in communications , and this will be implemented in accordance with Directive Ho 1 of the People &apos;s Committee .
With regard , to disabled Red Army fighters , they will be handled &quot; by the Red Army Relief and Comfort Committee of the ( central ) military committee and the Disabled Veterans Hospital in accordance with the regulations governing preferential treatment .
For the purpose of carrying out the aforementioned measures and all the stipulations set forth in the regulations governing preferential treatment of Red Army members , a committee has been set up under the military affairs department of the various county governments , and it will be responsible for the management of matters concerning the preferential treatment of Red Army members .
A provincial committee has &quot; been set up under the provincial government with the responsibility to oversee and .
direct the various county committees for the preferential treatment of Red Army members .
In order to supervise the thorough implementation of regulations governing the preferential treatment of Red Army members by the various levels of government , the Worker @-@ Peasant Inspection Department of the various levels of government will be responsible for dispatching personnel at any time to inspect , and if it is discovered that the regulations are not being implemented or charges had been brought by Red Army fighters or their families , the department will launch speedy investigations and take quick measures to rectify the situation .
The courts may prosecute such cases and punishment will be meted out in accordance with the offense .
Spring is now here and spring cultivation is imminent .
The various levels of governments and the political organisations of the Red Army must immediately discuss practical items of implementation and carry them out in accordance with the regulations governing the preferential treatment of Red Army members and the measures delineated in this directive .
The progress of implementation is to be reported to higher echelon at all times up to the Central Government for review .
It is of vital importance that there must be no negligence nor dragging of feet .

RESOLUTION ON THE COWICTION OF IMPORTANT MILITARY CRIMINALS OF THE REFORMED FACTION OF THE AB GROUP BY THE PROVISIONAL SUPREME COURT
February 1932
_ the text of the three court rulings should be approved in its entirety .
However . , a revision must be made of the following points :
Ts &apos;ao Shu @-@ hsiang was originally sentenced to 2 years &apos; imprisonment , &quot; but this Executive Committee meeting considers this sentence to be too light .
This is because she was commissar of the Fourth Branch Hospital of the Red Army Hospital and blatantly joined the AB Group to sabotage the &apos; Soviet regime and the Red Army , thus violating the trust of the Communist Party and the Soviet Government .
Moreover , Ts &apos;ao Shu @-@ hsiang had studied in the Soviet Union for 3 years .
During the time of her study in the Soviet Union , she sided politically with all bad elements .
After her return to the homeland , she came to the soviet area to work and joined the AB Group .
Thus it is obvious that her joining a counterrevolutionary organization was not accidental .
Hence , her imprisonment must be increased by 2 years and 3 months .
Altogether , she should be imprisoned for 3 years and 3 months .
The period of time during which she is stripped of her right to vote will still be according to the original ruling .
K &apos;ung Fan @-@ shu should have served 3 years1 imprisonment according to the decision .
But because he had performed considerable work during the revolutionary war and had been wounded and become disabled , the court reduced his sentence by 1 year and 6 months .
However , in the AB Group the duties he had assumed were those of general commander .
Although he had performed considerable revolutionary work in the past , the penalty that has been laid on him is still too light .
The imprisonment should be increased by 3 months .
Altogether , he will &quot; be imprisoned for 1 year and 9 months .
However , the period of time during which he is stripped of his right to vote will still be according to the original ruling .
3- Li Hsin @-@ chfeng was sentenced to 2 years * imprisonment , according to the decision .
Because he had been brave in every battle and wounded several times , , his sentence should be reduced by 6 months .
As a result , he will be imprisoned for 1 year and 6 months .
The period of time during which he is stripped of his right to vote will still be according to the original ruling .
Wei Eki @-@ Mng should serve 5 years1 imprisonment , according to the court ruling .
But according to the facts of the case , it is unavoidable that the punishment meted out is a little too heavy .
Hence , it should &quot; be reduced &quot; by 6 months and the imprisonment is for h years ancL 6 months .
However , the period of time during which he is stripped of his right to vote will still &quot; be according to the original ruling .
The above- stated counterrevolutionary criminals should &quot; be notified and made fully aware of this resolution on the reduction and increase of their respective terms of imprisonment .

LET ! TER FROM MAO TSE @-@ TIMG TO YUAN KUO @-@ P &apos;ING 6 March 1932
Comrade Yuan Kuo @-@ pTing :
Your first letter from Chiang @-@ k &apos;ou has been -received here .
Since the masses in San @-@ tu are like what you vrote in your letter , such places as Kii @-@ lung @-@ kang ought to &quot; be even &quot; better than San @-@ tu .
We should exert ourselves even more to win them over and not slacken our efforts and keep back because of mass awareness ,
Attention should be paid at all times to all tactics and methods used in this work .
We should not let this work deviate from the general task of &quot; winning over the masses to create a soviet area . &quot; It is not good to lower our political slogans to meet the demands of the political consciousness of the backward masses .
Now and then . , with the intent of winning over the masses , we of course can divide our work into a certain number of steps , but this should be done in a way that it will not deviate from our fundamental task , but will attain our general task of &quot; winning over the masses to create a soviet area &quot; in an even more realistic manner .
On the whole , the tactics and methods of work indicated in Issue No 3 of the Bulletin of the General Political Department are correct ; , but all of you should apply them flexibly and not follow the methods in the booklet stupidly .
Because our previous evaluation of the masses of the seven subdivisions of San @-@ tu differs somewhat from what is said in your letter this time , the application of work tactics and methods cannot be carried out mechanically .
For instance , judging from present conditions in San @-@ tu , if we follow too mechanically the method of attacking the big landlords first and the small landlords later this by no means is a tactical line --we will &quot; be stepping onto the road of opportunism .
Furthermore , the process of transforming peasants associations into Soviets and poor peasants associations must not last a long time .
First of all , we should make considerable efforts to arouse the masses of poor peasants , tenant farmers , and middle peasants to quickly rise and struggle .
In the struggle , the fight against big landlords should be quickly developed into a fight against small landlords and rich peasants .
( Goods should be distributed , fields distributed , and debts abolished . ) As soon as a comparative majority
of poverty @-@ stricken people have risen . , that &quot; bunch of profiteering small landlords and rich peasants remaining in the peasants associations should &quot; be expelled completely , and organs of political power of the massesthe sovietsand class organizations of the massesthe poor peasants associationsshould &quot; be established immediately * In a word , tactics and methods of work depend upon actual conditions .
You should acquaint yourselves with local conditions in a very practical way and decide on even more practical tactics and methods in accordance with the sentiments and requirements of the local populace about struggle &quot; before you can achieve still greater practical results .
When the Bed masses first enter a White village , reprisals and rash acts will necessarily occur .
You should also take note of similar incidents happening in other places .
As to discipline in the army forces , you cannot relax in the slightest .
If the masses want to fight , you should organize them into small guerrilla units to distribute the property of the evil gentry among the masses .
In order to organize small guerrilla units , you should organize elementary mass organizations--peasants associations .
In order to organize small guerrilla units , , you should even go so far as to organize provisional organs of political power--revolutionary committees .
In order to organize small guerrilla units , you should attack the local tyrants whom the nesses fear .
Why do I say this ?
It is because in such conditions as prevailing in the seven subdivisions of San @-@ tu ( not to speak of places where conditions are even worse than in the seven subdivisions of San @-@ tu , like Yung @-@ feng where the Third Army is working at present , the vicinity of Wan @-@ feng vrhere the 58th Army is working , An @-@ yuan @-@ szu where the Fourth Army is working , and the area bordering upon Shih @-@ ch &apos;eng and Ning @-@ hua where the 12th Army is working ) , there is no security for the different organizations such as public bodies and organs of political power , and diverse benefits , such as the distribution of fields and abolition of debts .
Once the Bed Army is withdrawn , the landlords will arm themselves and return , and all organisations will collapse and all benefits will be in vain .
At this time , only the organized small guerrilla units , which , have been trained by us and fought against the local bullies and distributed their property , and which have reached the point where they live in mortal enmity with the evil gentry and landlords , can retreat vith the Red Army to the Eed border and wait for an occasion to launch another Attack , l ^ hese are &apos; things that can be preserved .
This is the method to be used if your work this time is not to be in vain .
Let us not talk about incidents farther &quot; back .
Let us talk only about what happened after the battle for Chang @-@ sha .
Did not the first stage of work in the Pting @-@ chiang--Li @-@ ling--Tu @-@ hsien area , the first stage of work in the Yuan @-@ shui valley , and the first stage of work in the Vu @-@ chiang valley teach us that we had not grasped the heart of our workorganizing small guerrilla units that vere diverted from production ?
Was not the work of the comrades who went through untold hardships to distribute fields and abolish debts , set up Soviets , and organize Red Guard units ( which were not removed from production ) the same as having been done in vain ?
Since in your four letters you did not mention organising guerrilla units , I &apos;ve expressed myself on the subject at length in this letter .
However , this is not to say that you should not have a plan to establish
a consolidated regime in the seven subdivisions of San @-@ tu .
The conditions in the seven subdivisions of San @-@ tu today are vastly different from those in present @-@ day Ung @-@ feng , Nan @-@ feng5 and Ah @-@ yuan @-@ szu .
There can be no doubt that you should make plans for the establishment of a consolidated government .
You should plan to arouse the entire masses fully3 destroy the armed forces of the landlords thoroughly , organize class organisations of the masses and class organs of political power , and carry out land distribution .
But you should reckon with such conditions as the enemy can still advance rapidly , the Red Army must concentrate its forces , and the armed forces of the landlords have not yet been destroyed * If you have reckoned with these condi @-@ tionSj then you would have realized that organisation of local small guerrilla units which are removed from production and fight local bullies is really the central task of all your work .
To make organizing guerrilla units the central task not only will not ease your other work , , on the contrary ^ will mesh closely with your other work .
In the past ^ the political departments of the various armies and the overwhelming majority of comrades engaged in political work did not understand this central task of organizing guerrilla units in special circumstances .
What they did was work that did not fit in with the environmental conditions .
Therefore , they always expended much effort and got very little results .
For this reason ^ what is contained in this letter not only are instructions concerning the work of your units in the seven subdivisions of San @-@ tUj &quot; but also is something which all armies on the entire front and the various independent divisions and local guerrilla units should likewise take note of and absolutely do the same .

LETTER TO WEST KJKEEN ON THE WORK AT SHMG @-@ HMG AMD WU @-@ PTING 9 March 1932
West Fukien Soviet G @-@ overnment EKecutive Committee
Dear Comrades :
Shang @-@ hang and Wu @-@ p &apos;ing have &quot; been occupied completely within a few days &quot; by the 12th Army of our Red Army in coordination with the bread masses of &quot; workers and peasants .
Regimental &quot; bandit Cb.ung Shao @-@ kTuei and his forces were routed completely and fled to Kwangtung Province .
Winning this great victory at the start of expansion of the democratic revolutionary war will bear great significance on the development arid success of the Soviets throughout the country .
Especially at a time that the Red Army is besieging Kan @-@ chou , the seizure of the two counties of Shang @-@ hang and Wu @-@ p &apos;ing will not only menace the warlords in Kwangtung , but also be of great help to the capture of Kan @-@ chou .
The capture of Shang @-@ hang and Wu @-@ p &apos;ing counties not only will expand and strengthen the West Fukien Soviet Area , , but also will strengthen even more firmly the link between Fukien and Kiangsi .
Particularly the capture of the city of Shang @-@ hang , as it is one of the bigger key cities in West Fukien and holds an important position politically . , economically j and militarily .
Therefore , , the occupation of Shang @-@ hang and Wu @-@ p &apos;ing is not of a temporary nature , and they will be consolidated into a secure Red area in West Fukien and the city of Shang @-@ hang will be turned into a Red metropolis .
This is your great task .
You must make every effort to accomplish it .
The People &apos;s Council has the following instructions concerning the work in Shang @-@ hang and Wu @-@ p &apos;ing :
Implement correctly the Land lav , Labor Law , and economic policy of the All @-@ Soviet Congress .
This is a principal condition and basis for consolidating the Red regime in the two counties of Shang @-@ hang and Wu @-@ p &apos;ing .
Under this condition , arouse the broad roasses of workers and coolies in the cities , tenant farmers , poor peasantss and middle peasants in the rural areas , and
laboring people to take an active part in the agrarian revolutionary struggle and in the soviet regime .
They will have to gain some real &quot; benefits &quot; before they can &quot; be made to support the soviet regime enthusiastically .
You will have to have the &quot; broad masses of workers , peasants , and other laboring people as the base &quot; before you can consolidate the Red regime in the two counties .
To arouse the masses of workers in the cities , you will have to implement practically the 8 @-@ hour work rule in the labor law , raise wages . , set down a minimum wage standard , improve treatment , and enforce the conclusion of collective agreement and labor contract at the lowest limit .
The government must take -its stand with protecting the interests of workers and bring these minimum &quot; benefits to fruition immediately .
At the same time . , it should actively render assistance to workers in organising unions physically and in the course of work .
However , there are several points which we must make clear here and which we must guard against , as mistakes have frequently occurred in our work in the past : a ) Concerning the implementation of the Labor Law and the protection of workers &apos; interests , we have seen only official announcements that are void of content .
The government has not actually put the law into effect and has not taken any concrete steps to implement it .
Whether the worker has in fact received any benefits , the government has not made any inquiry or investigation .
If the government only issues a notice and an order and then brings the matter to a close , it is passivity so far as upholding workers * interests is concerned ; b ) In safeguarding workers * interests , the government for the most part did not check over facts and the conditions of mass struggle .
It simply used government orders to force the capitalists to comply and did not put emphasis on arousing the masses to rise in struggle .
On the contrary , it caused misunderstanding in this way among the masses , who for a time assumed a passive attitude toward struggle ; and c ) In implementing the labor Law , we invariably did not investigate the local economic situation and the actual conditions and requirements of the workers1 livelihood and did not set forth properly practical measures of implementation .
Instead , we overstepped the limitations imposed by actual economic conditions in the locality and enforced the law by coercion .
The result was that many capitalists vere unable to bear their responsibilities and closed their &quot; businesses , thereby undermining the current economic policy of the soviet and affecting to a very great extent the economy in the soviet areas .
This caused a &quot; big increase in the number of unemployed and raised doubts among many workers , who became passive toward struggle and even went so far as to make secret compromise with and concessions to the capitalists .
In the end , it curtailed the enthusiasm of the workers in struggle and weakened their class consciousness .
This is very harmful .
At the same time , we should oppose even more resolutely restraining the struggle of the workers and begin passive in safeguarding workers1 interests under the pretext of propping up the economy in a soviet area and carrying out its economic policy .
In a word , the Labor Lav must be put into effect under the conditions of resolutely safeguarding the workers &apos; benefits and not violating the economic policy of the , government , and in particular , intensifying the enthusiasm of the workers in class struggle and building up their support of the Soviet regime .
As to confiscation of land and distribution of land in the rural areas , it is imperative that the Land Law &quot; be implemented fully .
The most important thing to do is line up with a clear @-@ cut class line and never again allow the rich peasants to steal even for a moment the fruits of the agrarian revolution .
There is a mistaken conception of land distribution in the past which mist &quot; be rectified .
It is &quot; believed that at the start of an agrarian revolution it is unavoidable that rich peasants will steal land once . , so it is necessary to distribute land a second time , or a third time , before the matter is finally settled .
For this reason , when people start out to distribute land they do it carelessly .
This is utterly wrong .
We can only say that in an agrarian revolution rich peasants will inevitably endeavor to steal the benefits of the agrarian revolution and precisely &quot; because of this , we should be even more resolute in arousing the masses to deal a heavy blow at the attempts of rich peasants and with a clear @-@ cut class line , not let the benefits of an agrarian revolution be stolen by rich peasants .
This mistake has happened again and again in the newly developed areas of KLangsi Province .
The main reason for this is that when land is distributed , emphasis is not given to arousing tile masses and distribution is carried out by orders instead of by the masses .
In this way , rich peasants naturally make use of the opportunity to steal .
Of course , the speedy distribution of land in a newly developed area is for the purpose of quickly mobilising and winning over the basic sections of the masses in the countryside so as to consolidate this area , but to allow rich peasants to steal the benefits of land distribution , this cannot consolidate a new area solidly .
As for rapid distribution , only by mobilizing the basic sections of the masses in the countryside to take an active part in the land distribution struggle can distribution be carried out rapidly and the attempts of rich peasants be dealt a crushing blow so that the benefits of agrarian revolution will not be stolen by them .
Before a new @-@ area can be consolidated firmly it must have as its base the broad masses of tenant farmers , poor peasants , and middle peasants who are taking an active part in struggle .
Therefore , when land is distributed it is necessary to hold a mass meeting and promulgate the land Law of the Central Government in order to mobilise the masses .
The committee on land distribution should draw @-@ many tenant farmers , poor peasants , and middle peasants as well , into taking part in its affairs .
All members of the committee must be elected by the masses .
The composition of members of the land committee must be announced and investigated at a mass meeting .
Decisions made at every land distribution must be reported to the masses in a rally and only after the mass meeting concurs in these decisions will actual distribution be carried out .
The most important thing is that when the land law is promulgated and the land distribution committee members are elected , it must be announced specifically that rich peasants can only share run @-@ down fields and that they cannot join the land committee so as to draw the attention of the masses to them and bring about a struggle to deal a blow to their attempts and eject them or prevent them from sneaking into the land committee and usurping the authority to distribute land .
In the past , when land was distributed in new areas , it was done entirely through the Red Army .
Most of the time , the Soviet governments did not send anyone to give guidance and in the worst cases , just ignored the whole thing and let the Red Army bear the responsibility alone .
In this way , on the one hand , it hindered the Red Army from performing its other duties .
At the same time , &quot; because of its other duties , the Red Army could not concentrate on distributing land .
Naturally , carelessness in distribution set in .
Without question , formalism was very serious in the past within the Bed Army in the distribution of land .
But the local governments had to bear the main blame for this state of affairs . , because they had relinquished their responsibilities and not exercised their leadership in the matter , ^ This time . , when land is confiscated and distributed in the two counties of Shang @-@ hang and Wu @-@ pring , the West Fukien Government must exercise positive leadership and perform the task correctly according to the above instructions and your own experiences gained in past land distributions .
ij- .
You should pay serious attention to the question of middle peasants .
In the past , instances of exclusion of middle peasants and assault on them under the pretext of carrying out attacks on rich peasants have occurred in many places .
This is nothing short of undermining the coalition with middle peasants and inflicting the greatest harm on the future of the consolidation of the Soviet regime and the success of the revolution .
In your work in Shang @-@ hang and Wu @-@ pTing this time you absolutely must not recycle those mistakes of the past .
Firstly , on the land question , in carrying out equal distribution , you absolutely must abide by the principle governing middle peasants outlined in Article 5 of &quot; the land law ( ... this can be carried out only with concurrence and direct support of the basic sections of the peasant masses- If the majority of middle peasants do not concur , they may not take part in equal distribution ) and implement it correctly .
Secondly , in the matter of fund raising , you absolutely should not harass middle peasants .
In newly developed areas it is the easiest to start trouble over fund raising .
Funds that we intend to raise should not come from middle peasants .
Thirdly , you must actively draw activists among the middle peasants into taking part in land distribution and particularly in the regime , and strictly prevent the occurrence of such phenomena as excluding middle peasants from participating in elections and in the regime .
In a word , strengthening of the coalition with middle peasants is one of the principal bases for success of the agrarian revolution and the Soviet regime .
You must absolutely oppose encroaching upon middle peasants and even go so far as to make concessions to them to a certain degree ( like letting them take part in equal distribution of land ) .
5- In your work in the cities of Shang @-@ hang and Wu @-@ p &apos;ing , apart from the question of workers and performing your duties in the light of the many fundamental rules and measures contained in the letter from the General Political Department on the work at Kan @-@ chou , you must :
Firstly , act correctly in accordance with the economic policy laid down at the National Soviet Congress and the tariff , investment regulations , and loan regulations promulgated by the Provisional Central Government , and apply the experiences gained at Tring @-@ chou in this work .
Also render the above documents into notices for publication ;
Secondly , make every effort to prop up commerce and do not disrupt it &quot; by fund raising .
As to fund raising , the targets should , &quot; be graded and money should not be collected from small capitalists and a portion of the middle capitalists .
All shops operated &quot; by reactionary headmen should &quot; be confiscated and the crimes of these headmen and the reasons for confiscation of their property should &quot; be published in detail .
Such proclamations should deal primarily with confiscation of the property of reactionaries and not with confiscation of the stores so as to expose any attempt of the reactionaries to spread rumors ;
Thirdly , declare formally as confiscated all premises of reactionary organs and make them the property of the Soviet government for distribution to various government organs and mass organizations for use .
There need not occur such anarchical acts of various organs and organizations occupying these premises at vill .
The houses and property of reactionaries should all &quot; be declared confiscated &quot; by the government .
A number of the houses confiscated may &quot; be distributed to workers to &quot; be used as dormitories and a number leased at reduced rent to poor people as residential quarters .
Aside from cash which goes to the government . , part of the confiscated property may be used to aid the Red Army and the masses in disaster areas , and the remainder distributed as much as possible among poverty @-@ stricken people in the cities .
You should oppose any move to transfer all things confiscated to the old soviet areas and not to distribute them among the local populace .
You should oppose even more firmly such anarchical manifestations as various government organs and mass organizations going their own way to confiscate and dispose of the property of the reactionaries ;
Fourthly , preserve absolutely such things as schools and culture .
At the worst , send people around to supervise their safekeeping and prohibit vandalism ; and
Fifthly , compel shops in Shang @-@ hang to convert immediately the small notes and paper money they have issued into cash and withdraw them for destruction .
In ease of necessity , the government should send people around to exercise supervision .
Henceforth , all shops should be prohibited from issuing paper money .
You should pay attention to the cash money in circulation so as to prevent reactionaries and merchants from smuggling it out in quantity , thereby affecting the economy in the soviet area .
Fund raising should be centralized and concentrated in one organ to &quot; be set up by representatives from the West Fukien Government and the Political Department of the 12th Army .
The different organizations and organs should &quot; be strictly prohibited from dealing blows to local tyrants .
Set up a unified base for finance .
Of the money collected , the greater part should be used to help the Red Army in expanding the revolutionary war .
Strictly prohibit all waste and extravagance on account of a wider source of income .
If waste does occur , harsh punishment should be meted out .
7- The work of suppressing counterrevolutionaries must &quot; be carried out correctly in accordance with Directive No 6 of the Central Government governing the establishment of committees for the suppression of counterrevolutionaries and all fundamental rules concerning the suppression of counterrevolution .
You should &quot; be prepared to set up a judicial department and a political security bureau to maintain revolutionary order and carry out judicial work relative to the economy .
The setting up of a provisional regime is very important .
Immediately upon its establishment ^ the revolutionary committee will put into effect all the decrees of the National Soviet Congress and the Central Government so as to carry out the agrarian revolution and the political platform , , suppress the activities of counterrevolutionaries , mobilize the broad masses of workers and peasants . , and set up a formal regime .
These are the main tasks of a revolutionary committee * Every revolutionary committee must be elected at a mass rally .
The West Fukien Government should make every effort to lead and direct the work of the revolutionary committees in various places .
It should be resolved by the West Fukien Government that Shang @-@ hang become a municipal soviet directly under its authority .
When the work of land confiscation and distribution and suppression of counterrevolutionaries has been carried out to a certain extent , you should energetically proceed with work for the establishment of a formal regime .
First and foremost , the urban and rural Soviets should accomplish the aim of setting up a genuine representative system so as to lay a strong foundation for the soviet organization in the two counties of Shang @-@ hang and Wu @-@ p &apos;ing .
The establishment of all formal regimes must be completely in accordance with the regulations and directives promulgated &quot; by the Central Government .
Revolutionary committees must become organs to lead mass struggle , guard against the development of formalism , and prevent rich peasants and reactionaries from sneaking in .
9- The creation of regional armed forces must be carried out according to plan .
You should discuss with the military district headquarters about the methods in doing it so as to build up the military might of the masses to defend the soviet area of Shang @-@ hang and u @-@ pfing .
As to areas newly developed by the Red Army , the West Fukien Government has heretofore relied upon the Red Army to carry on the work there , while it itself does not exercise active leadership or make any effort to build up and consolidate the areas .
For example : lien @-@ ch &apos;eng and Ning @-@ hua have been occupied by the 12th Army for a long time .
The West Fukien Government has not paid any heed to exercising leadership there , with the result that the newly developed areas cannot be consolidated , In the worst case , as soon as the Red Army leaves a place , reactionaries will reoccupy it and the place Is lost to us .
This is an extremely serious mistake .
In the work at Shang @-@ hang and Wu @-@ pTing , we absolutely cannot permit past mistakes to be @-@ perpetuated .
You should muster and mobilize a large number of working personnel in the old soviet areas to go and work in the two counties , and responsible comrades of the West Fukien Government should go in person to Shang @-@ hang to direct all kinds of work there .
Now you must consolidate Shang @-@ hang and Wu @-@ p &apos;ing with all strength .
This is a most practical and most important task at present .
Ho other work is as important as this one .
Therefore , we have decided that in order to consolidate Shang @-@ hang and Wu @-@ p &apos;ing , the Fukien Congress of Representatives of -Peasants &quot; be postponed .
We hope that you will immediately notify the different levels of government of this postponement and take advantage of it to step up lower @-@ level elections and remolding work .
In order to strengthen the work at Shang @-@ hang and Wu @-@ p &apos;ing , the working comrades previously sent by the West Fukien Government to the Central Government for training can be sent back to you right away for reassignment to Shang @-@ hanj and Wu @-@ p &apos;ing to help in the work there .
Comrades !
The consolidation of Shang @-@ hang and Wu @-@ p &apos;ing is your most central task at the present time .
You should accomplish this task with all strength and turn the two counties of Shang @-@ hang and Wu @-@ p &apos;ing into the most secure soviet territory and the city of Shang @-@ hang into a Red metropolis .
Lastly ^ we hope that you will reproduce this letter for distribution to the Political Department of the 12th Army and working comrades at Shang @-@ hang and Wu @-@ p &apos;ing .
Please report to the Central Government at any time on recent conditions in Shang @-@ hang and Wu @-@ p &apos;ing and on the work there from now on .

DIRECTIVE FROM PROVISIONAL CEltfTRAL GOVERNMENT TO FIRST WORKER @-@ PEASANT @-@ SOLDIER SOVIET CONGRESS IN FUKtEN PROVINCE
March 1932
/ Text / Comrade representatives to the First Worker @-@ Peasant @-@ Soldier Soviet Congress
Dear Comrades &apos; .
Your All @-@ Fukien Soviet Congress was inaugurated on the first most glorious anniversary of the world proletarian revolutionthe anniversary of the Paris Commune .
At a time when the situation of the Chinese revolution has developed to a very crucial moment all over the world , and particularly in the midst of expanding the revolutionary war at present , the 12th Army of the Red Army scored a great victory in successively capturing Shang @-@ hang and Wu @-@ p &apos;ing , the holding of your congress is of great significance .
At the same time , it demonstrates that the revolutionary task &quot; being shouldered by your congress this time is the greatest in history .
Apart from sending representatives to attend your congress and help in guiding its work , the Central Executive Committee specially sends you this written directive .
Both in the vorld and in China , the current revolutionary situation has entered a most critical new period .
This tense new situation is &quot; being symbolized &quot; by the consolidation and flourishing of Soviet Socialism , sudden decline of world capitalism , contradictions &quot; between the two systems of Socialism and capitalism reaching an extremely acute degree , and stepping up of attempts &quot; by imperialism to attack the Soviet Union .
The tension symbolized &quot; by the inner contradictions of imperialism has deepened the crisis of outbreak of imperialist war .
Simultaneously , the crisis of world revolution has gradually ripened with each passing day .
Owing to the sharp development of these crises , it suddenly happened in September last year that Japanese imperialism employed force to occupy first China &apos;s three Northeast Provinces and then Shanghai .
This was not only a crisis symbolized by Japanese imperialism partitioning China and suppressing the Chinese revolution in order to save itself ?
but also an outbreak of the acute contradictions of imperialism striving to partition China and redivide the world .
Hence ,
since the outbreak of this incident the conflict &quot; between Japan and the United States in particular has &quot; become extremely tense .
All imperialist countries have mobilized and made other preparations for war .
With all this saber rattling , the situation has developed to an explosive point .
Nevertheless , the imperialists have not forgotten about attacking the Soviet Union .
Therefore , they are attempting to turn this war at any time into a war against the Soviet Union .
In China , since their defeat in the third offensive against the revolution , the reactionary Kuomintang and its government have been symbolized by divergence and disintegration and the daily deepening collapse of their reactionary rule .
After the outbreak of the incident of the Northeast Provinces , they have become increasingly more brazen in betraying China , taking the place of the imperialists in trampling on the anti @-@ imperialist movement .
The rule of the reactionary Kuomintang throughout the country has become even more bankrupt and the authority of this reactionary rule has been crushed to almost nothing in the revolutionary struggles of the masses .
Today . , after selling the Northeast Provinces . , the Kuomintang and its government continue to sell Shanghai .
Recently they have been trying to provoke a war among the imperialists and prompt them to settle without delay the question of the partition of China so as to sell the whole of China and sacrifice countless workers , peasants , and other toiling people under the planes and artillery shells of the imperialists in a war .
Nobody knows how many people in the Northeast Provinces and Shanghai have sacrificed their lives under the places and guns of Japanese imperialism , , but the Kuomintang and its government have fled toward Loyang preparatory to turning over the coastal area along the Yangtze Elver to the imperialists to be used as a battleground .
The Kuomintang warlords still hang on to the coattails of various imperialist countries , however .
When the great war breaks out , there can be no doubt that they will become the tools of the imperialists to contest for China and massacre the masses .
At the same time , even if under the circumstances , the Kuomintang and its government should , become bankrupt , it is certain that they will be sent to their graves by a worker @-@ peasant revolution .
In the national revolutionary movement , since the great victory of the third revolutionary war and the establishment of the Provisional Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic , the Soviets and the Red Army in various places have continued to gain great victories and progress .
The high tide of anti @-@ imperialism all over the country came about as a result of the invasion of China and massacre of the Chinese people by Japanese imperialism , but it has surged like roaring waves under the bold @-@ faced attempt of the Kuomintang to betray China .
At present , this anti @-@ imperialist movement has developed to the point where the masses in many places armed themselves voluntarily and fought against Japanese imperialism directly , Party headquarters and government organs of the Kuomintang were demolished , and down @-@ with @-@ the @-@ Kuomintang slogans were shouted openly .
Especially in Shanghai recently , soldiers of the White army stood up voluntarily and acting contrary to Kuomintang orders , resisted the Japanese army directly at the front .
The development of the workers1 struggle throughout the country will gradually secure for us the leadership of the anti @-@ imperialist movement .
The sudden
revolutionization of soldiers of the White array means that not only in the midst of the anti @-@ imperialist movement they will fight against Japan voluntarily , but also they will mutiny and stage uprisings and enter the Red Army .
All this shows that the Chinese revolutionary movement and the anti @-@ imperialist national revolutionary movement in particular are forging ahead .
Prospects are that they will inevitably converge under the Soviet banner and in a national revolutionary war , will drive out Imperialism . , overthrow the Kuomintang rule ^ and strive for victory of the Soviet all over the country .
This Is a new period in history , a time for revolution and war .
Hence , our task Is to develop the revolutionary war actively .
e will lead the Chinese national revolutionary struggle with the revolutionary war , oppose the invasion of China and massacre of the Chinese people by Japanese imperialism with a national revolutionary war , destroy the reactionary Kuomintang rule with the revolutionary war _ , and stamp out an imperialist world war with a national revolutionary war .
This is a most critical time in the development of the revolution , a time most favorable to the development of the Soviet revolution .
Just as we began to expand the revolutionary war on a large scale , we have scored great new victories and made considerable progress .
Our specific task for the time being is to keep up these victories &quot; by working even harder to mobilise tens of millions of workers , peasants , and other people to participate in the revolutionary war and proceed with the expansion of this war on a large scale to contest for major cities in neighboring areas and strive for a Soviet victory first in one province and then in several provinces .
This is also the most important central task to &quot; be shouldered by your congress this time .
In order to carry out this task , all the work at your congress will center around the expansion of the revolutionary war .
First of all , you should discuss all kinds of specific policies concerning the realistic mobilization of the masses .
This work of mobilization is primarily to promote struggle and plunge into the heat of struggle .
To heighten the enthusiasm of the masses of workers and peasants in struggle , it Is necessary to enforce effectively the labor law and land law .
The congress must set up a formula in a very specific form for implementation of the Labor Law and Land Law , Only through actual contacts in struggle can we arouse the hundreds of thousands of workers , peasants , and other people of Fukien Province to join enthusiastically in the revolutionary war .
To develop the revolutionary war , , it is necessary to expand and strengthen the Bed Army .
This is the main strength to develop the revolutionary war .
The congress must discuss in a very concrete way practical measures for carrying out the expansion of the Red Army and implementation of the preferential treatment of the Red Army .
It must repudiate the previous local concept in West Fukien of expanding only the regional armed forces and not caring about expanding the Red Army , because this is very harmful to strengthening the force to carry out the revolutionary war and developing the actual tasks of revolutionary war .
To develop the revolutionary -war and strive for a Soviet victory first in Kiangsi Province , it is necessary to adopt an offensive strategy aimed at expanding outward actively .
This offensive strategy is by no means adventurism in that it entails no venturesome advance and no abandonment of the consolidation of &quot; bases .
On the contrary , it is to consolidate our successes and forge ahead .
The congress must also set the direction of expansion .
Essentially it will &quot; be northward .
This will coordinate with the over @-@ all expansion plan of the Central Government to strive actually for Kiangsi and several of its neighboring provinces as an initial victory .
But in other respects , it is likewise necessary to expand the Soviet area outward .
And to accomplish the task of expanding northward . , the most central task at present is to consolidate Shang @-@ hang and Wu @-@ p &apos;ing .
The congress must discuss concrete measures to mobilize a great number of cadres and carry out the work that should be done as pointed out in the letter from the Central Government to the West Fukien Government .
The consolidation of Shang @-@ hang and Wu @-@ p &apos;ing will not only cement the link between Kwangtung and Kiangsi Provinces , but also strengthen the force and consolidate the foundation for expanding outward and carrying on the revolutionary war .
Vfe must be firmly against a venturesome advance that does not seek consolidation of the bases .
Similarly , conservatism that seeks only consolidation and not outward expansion is extremely detrimental to the current task of carrying on the revolutionary war to expand outward on a large scale .
The congress should struggle resolutely against any such tendency .
To strengthen the force for expanding the revolutionary war , it is necessary to consolidate the economic strength for expanding the revolutionary war .
The congress must discuss in detail a formula for developing the economy in the Soviet area and increasing the rate of production and concrete measures for implementing the economic policy .
As to the fiscal question , the congress should draw up very specific measures to unify finance in accordance with the financial regulations promulgated &quot; by the Central Government .
The question as to how to practice frugality in expenditures in order to help expand the revolutionary war should be discussed even more realistically .
The congress should resolutely oppose serious manifestations of willful extravagance at the different levels of government in the past and set forth measures of punishment for such acts in the future .
To strengthen the force of expansion in the revolutionary war , it is necessary to strengthen the organisation and training of the regional armed forces and enhance their practical role in the revolutionary war .
In the past , although the regional armed forces of West Fukien were unsound , they absolutely were not like what people generally say , that &quot; the West Fukien regional armed forces are useless &quot; or &quot; the people of West Fukien cannot fight . &quot; Such mistaken concepts must be firmly opposed &quot; by the congress .
The regional armed forces and the masses of workers and peasants of West Fukien not only have engaged in prolonged struggle against the enemy , but also have created an extensive Soviet area .
They possess great strength for waging &apos;revolutionary struggle .
The main reason wiry earlier regional armed forces were not strong was that the line was mistaken .
During the period of adventurism West Fukien suffered a great defeat .
later , in the first , second , and .
third revolutionary
it committed errors of conservatism militarily and did not know how to apply guerrilla warfare tactics .
Sometimes it did not correctly estimate the &quot; balance of enemy strength and adopted the method of stubborn attack ( as in the several offensives against K &apos;an @-@ shih and Hu @-@ lei ) , with the result that partial military losses were sustained , the morale of the troops was lowered , and fighting power was depleted .
At the same time , inattention to leadership and to the military and political training of the regional armed forces was also an important reason .
The congress must meticulously discuss measures to reorganize the regional armed forces and strengthen political and military work and put guerrilla warfare tactics to use , so as to enhance the role of the regional armed forces in the revolutionary war .
To strengthen the leadership for expanding the revolutionary war , it is necessary to set up a strong and capable Soviet government at different levels .
Ihe congress should realistically discuss measures to establish soviets in accordance with the regulations and resolutions promulgated &quot; by the Central Government .
Here , we wish especially to draw your attention to the establishment of a Soviet representative system in the cities and countryside .
This system is the &quot; basis of the Soviet organization and the most powerful &quot; basic organization in a Soviet to lead the masses and mobilize the masses .
The congress must oppose earlier manifestations of Soviet formalism and disengagement from the masses .
These are all tasks for setting up a strong and capable Soviet .
In case there are serious obstructions , the congress must draw up concrete measures to carry out inspection of work at the different levels of the Soviet .
In the past several years the West Fukien Soviet has achieved great success and victories in engaging the enemy in a great struggle , carrying out resolutely the tasks of agrarian revolution , creating an extensive soviet area , and implementing the land program of the government .
At the same time . , it has also committed many mistakes and displayed many shortcomings .
The congress must make a review of its past work .
Only in this way can valuable experiences in earlier struggles be summed up and all mistakes and shortcomings be rectified ,
In the past , through errors of the adventurist line .
West Fukien suffered plenty of defeats .
Later , it turned around from the adventurist line .
This was immediately followed by the first , second , and third offensive of the enemy , and because West Fukien committed mistakes in military tactics , many regions were sacked and a part of the soviet area was occupied by the enemy and still has not been recovered .
In addition , due to errors in leadership of the regional armed forces , some border regions were ravaged by brigands .
Nevertheless , due to an incorrect understanding of the causes of these phenomena and as a result of past mistakes in lines for work , a great number of working personnel of the Soviet have even overlooked the current favorable situation in tbe development of the revolution and have taken , a pessimistic view and developed a feeling of despair .
This is a very serious mistake .
We must understand that the current revolutionary situation is extremely favorable to the development of the revolution .
At the same time when we are leading the masses in expanding the revolutionary war outward ,
these sentiments are extremely harmful and we should not allow them to exist and grow .
&apos;Ehe congress must struggle mercilessly against such sentiments .
Here ^ the need is even greater for the congress to carry out a transformation of &quot; work strictly in accordance with the lines for vork prescribed by the National Soviet Congress and the Central Government .
It is certain that the work in the entire province of Funkien will have rapid development and &quot; bring even greater progress and success to the Fukien Soviet Area .
The above instructions are provided for your discussion of all problems in the congress .
&#91; Hie Central Executive Committee holds a firm belief that this congress will certainly meet with complete success in the end and accomplish the critical tasks of the revolution at the present time .
Lastly , we hail : Long live the success of the First Worker @-@ Peasant @-@ Soldier Soviet Congress in Fukien Province &apos; .
Long live the victory of the Soviet !
Long live the Chinese Soviet Republict

ORDER OF THE PROVISIONAL CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ON MOBILIZATION AND DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST JAPAN
15 April 1932
_ Since tlie invasion of China &apos;s three northeast provinces and the attack against Shanghai by Japanese imperialism . , the Soviet Central Government in its communiques has repeatedly pointed out that Japanese imperialism aims at the complete colonisation of the three northeast provinces , that the Shanghai incident will &quot; become a concrete manifestation of the partition of China by the imperialist gangsters , and that the Kuomintang government and its warlords of different factions will even more &quot; brazenly capitulate to the imperialists . , &quot; betray China , and suppress the anti @-@ Japanese and anti- imperialist movement of the Chinese people nation @-@ wide , and will absolutely not make any anti- Japanese move that really seeks national independence and liberation .
Present developments of the situation prove completely that the appraisal of the Soviet Central Government is correct .
A Manchurian puppet government has been set up in the northeast provinces .
This is the most faithful and obidient running dog of Japanese iarperialism , The peace negotiations &quot; being held in Shanghai and the League of Nations investigation mission are nothing but a spoils conference and a spoils setup for the imperialist gangsters to carry out the partition of Shanghai and China .
Certain Kuomintang warlords , who had been compelled to assume an appearance of being anti @-@ Japanese due to the bravery of those soldiers who fought against the Japanese voluntarily , have now shown their true colors .
Ma Chan @-@ shan has &quot; become war minister in the Manchurian government , and warlords Chiang and Ts &apos;ai have participated in the peace negotiations of the imperialists to partition Shanghai .
The Kuomintang government stands ready at any time to accept the order of the League of Nations to carve up the Chinese nation .
Its propaganda about so @-@ called &quot; protracted resistance &quot; is meant to deceive the anti @-@ Japanese people throughout the country on the one hand , , and on the other hand , to seek aid from another bloc of imperialist countries ( American imperialism in particular ) and provoke a world war so that the imperialist gangsters may resolve the question of the partition of China in that war .
In the past several months , the Kuomintang government and its warlords of different factions , adhering to the will of the imperialists , have made the greatest efforts to dissolve anti @-@ Japanese organizations all over the country , suppress anti @-@ Japanese strikes , massacre anti @-@ Japanese and anti @-@ imperialist masses , shoot down with machineguns the brave soldiers who had resisted the Japanese
voluntarily , and prohibit the activities of the peopled volunteers .
In particular , they have employed the greatest military force to deal with their offensive against the soviet area and the Red Army .
All this shows that the Kiiomintang government and its warlords of different factions are entirely tools of imperialism to suppress directly the Chinese national revolutionary movement .
They not only will never wage a national revolutionary war against Japanese imperialism , &quot; but also will &quot; become the ultimate obstacle to the prosecution of a national revolutionary wart
Only the toiling masses , , the workers and peasants , all over the country represent a genuine anti @-@ imperialist force .
Only the Soviet and the Red Army can really conduct a national revolutionary war against Japanese imperialism .
Today , &quot; being trampled under the iron heels of Japanese imperialism , the oppressed Chinese people are unwilling to accept the insults of the Kuomintang , and in high indignation , have risen to engage in revolutionary struggle against Japan and the Kuomintang .
With the aim of leading the toiling masses , the workers and peasants , all over the country in carrying through the revolutionary task of driving Japanese imperialism out of China , the Soviet Provisional Central Government hereby formally declares war against Japan .
The Soviet Provisional Central Government wishes to point out to the oppressed people throughout the country that the soviet area has long since extricated itself from the fetters of imperialism , but the Kuomintang warlords , under the leadership and direction of imperialism , will on no account ease up their offensive against the soviet area and the Red Army .
Had not for the offensive of the Kuomintang warlords , the toiling raasses , the workers and peasants , and the Red Army would have long stood on the side of the courageous soldiers and volunteers fighting against the Japanese directly .
Therefore , the Soviet Provisional Central Government is at present leading the Chinese Workers and Peasants1 Red Army and the broad masses of workers , peasants , and other toiling people of the soviet area in actively carrying out a revolutionary war to seize major cities &quot; beyond the border of the soviet area and .
destroy the Kuomintang rule .
Precisely , the realistic prosecution of a national revolutionary war is an indispensable prerequisite to a direct war against Japan .
The Soviet Central Government calls on workers , peasants , soldiers , and all other toiling people throughout the country to arise and take an active part in carrying out the revolutionary war under the Soviet red banner .
Those people in areas under White rule should voluntarily arm themselves , organize people &apos;s anti @-@ Japanese volunteers , seise the arms of the Kuomintang , landlords , and bourgeoisie , and fight against Japan directly , setting up revolutionary military committees to direct this latter move .
Soldiers of the White Army should rise in revolt , overthrow their reactionary officers , do battle against Japan voluntarily , organize workers and peasants1 red armies to overthrow the Kuomintang rule all over the country , and establish a Soviet regime of the people throughout China .
In this way , they vill drive Japanese imperialism out of China with a national revolutionary war , opposing the partition of China by the imperialists , and striving for the independence and liberation of the Chinese nation ,
Hence , apart from making public through a circular telegram this advocacy of declaration of -war against Japan and an action program , the Soviet Provisional Central Government issues the following instructions to the Workers and Peasants * Red Army all over the country and the Soviet Government at various levels throughout the Soviet areas :
The Central Revolutionary Military Council , military committees in various Soviet areas , military district headquarters in various places , , and Red Guard units ( i.e. , military affairs departments ) in various counties should carry out mobilization of all Fed warriors for the declaration of war against Japan so as to make every Red warrior understand that active expansion of the revolutionary war . , annihilation of the forces of Kuomintang warlords attacking the Soviet areas . , seizure of major cities beyond the border of the Soviet areas , and overthrow of the Kuomintang rule are precisely the indispensable prerequisite to the waging of a national revolutionary war against Japan .
The more the civil revolutionary war is expanded . , the more disintegrated the Kuomintang warlords will become , and the closer the occasion approaches of direct war against Japan .
So the Red warriors throughout the Soviet Area should &quot; be ready for the arrival of national revolutionary war on an even larger scale .
Mobilization for the declaration of war against Japan should absolutely not wait for direct war with Japanese imperialism to begin before &quot; being carried out .
Moreover , the courageous soldiers and people &apos;s volunteers in coastal areas under White rule have long refused to place themselves under the command of Kuomintang warlords and have fought against the Japanese voluntarily .
They are in urgent need of guidance and assistance from the Soviet Area and the Red Army .
Therefore , mobilization for the declaration of war against Japan and active outward expansion of the revolutionary war absolutely cannot be split apart .
Mobilization for the expansion of the revolutionary war should be considered as a blow to Japanese imperialism and as stout support of the anti @-@ Japanese masses and brave soldiers in the White areas .
Military mobilization should be carried out to the extent that every Red warrior cannot leave his unit unless she is wounded or sick , those who desert will be subjected to punishment and public ridicule . , regional armed forces will observe the same discipline as the Red Army , Red Guard units that are not diverted from production will step up military training , military affairs committees will proclaim and enforce Red martial law throughout the Soviet areas , production in arsenals will be increased , grain stations and transportation stations will be set up along all major communication lines , a portion of the spiked millet crop will be stored up in preparation for a rice shortage , expenditures will be kept down in preparation for a protracted war , precautionary fortifications facing outward will be &quot; built along the borders of newly developed regions , and armed units for fund raising will stand ready to move ( a major portion of the taxes to be collected by the government will naturally be furnished to the Red Anqy so as to enable this main military force to continue performing its fighting task ) .
Moreover , guerrilla units will be organized in great numbers to expand outward along the border of the Soviet Area , because they may be able to lead the people in places close to major cities or within the imperialist sphere of influence in organizing anti @-@ Japanese volunteers to conduct guerrilla action .
The General Political Department of the Workers and Peasants &apos; Red Army and political departments at different levels of the Red Army should carry out political mobilization within the Red Army and regional armed forces .
They should conduct extensive propaganda on the declaration of war against Japan among the Red warriors &apos; and Taring to light on a regular &quot; basis in HUNG @-@ ESIHG PAO _ / Bed Star Journal _ 7 and other Red Army publications such facts as the invasion and partition of China &quot; by Japan and other imperialist countries , and their massacre and oppression of the Chinese people , and the &quot; betrayal of China and insulting of the Chinese nation by the Kuomintang , so as to stimulate the enthusiasm and courage of the entire Red warriors in the declaration of war against Japan and heighten their determination to expand the revolutionary war outward and liquidate the Kuomintang warlords and their rule .
Furthermore , they should compile and print all sorts of pamphlets and pictorials . , raise slogans of propaganda and provocation having a bearing on practical actions at the present time .
Above all others , they should pay attention to the political work of the Red Army in newly developed regions , and particularly those places close to major cities .
&quot; When the Workers and Peasants &apos; Red Army progresses toward the sphere of influence of Japanese imperialism ; , the combat task of the Red Army vill be to annihilatethe Kuomintang forces which are in league with the imperialists .
If we let go those Kuomintang forces which are attacking the Red Army without wiping them out , we will &quot; be giving them a very good opportunity to exterminate the Red Army in coordination with imperialist forces .
This is a step that will &quot; bring confusion to the anti @-@ Japanese national revolutionary war and not really drive Japanese imperialism out of China .
When Red guerrilla armies in their outward expansion approach the Japanese imperialist sphere of influence , they should lead the people in organising anti @-@ Japanese volunteers , arming themselves voluntarily , conducting guerrilla action , and fighting against Japan directly .
They also should draw soldiers of the White army into fighting against Japan voluntarily and together with them , and organize revolutionary military councils to direct this action so as to divide and overthrow the control of the Kuomintang warlords .
The different levels of the Soviet government in the various soviet areas should immediately conduct a mass mobilization for the declaration of war -against Japan .
In the first place , they should step up mobilizing the toiling masses , the workers and peasants , to join the Red Army voluntarily , expand the revolutionary war outward ^ and be ready to fight against Japanese imperialism directly .
They should mobilize the entire toiling masses to undertake voluntarily rear echelon services in the revolutionary war , first by joining the Red Guard and Young Pioneers , which are not diverted from production .
They should cause the toiling masses throughout the Soviet areas , whether male or female , to clamor enthusistically for military training in order to prepare themselves for war against Japan .
They should strive to mobilize the people to perform the work of consolidating the bases of the Soviet areas , step up enforcing Red martial law and regional self @-@ defense , save on expenses and food to help the Red Army , and store up public grain to supply to the Red Army .
They should mobilise the masses to redouble their
efforts in farming BO as to have a bumper harvest this year , consolidate the Red postal service , and make a sustained effort to repair &quot; bridges and roads so as to strengthen communication in the Soviet areas .
They should immediately levy a progressive tax on commerce and &quot; be prepared to collect a land tax so as to increase the revenues of the government .
They should mobilize the toiling masses , the workers and peasants , to raise the production of supplies for the Red Army ( such as clothing , bedding , shoes , headgear , and ordinance ) , organize stretcher bearer teams , transport teams , laundry teams , and comforting teams to assist the Red Army in battle , follow the regulations governing the preferential treatment of the Red Army , help family dependents of the Red Army in tilling the fields , and cultivate the public fields of the Red Army .
5- This order is issued all the way down to the subordinate @-@ level units of the Workers and Peasants1 Red Army and regional armed forces and to all Soviets in the cities and countryside .
They should draw up their respective mobilization plans in accordance with this order .
The Central Revolutionary Military Council all the more should make public its own plan of mobilization

CIRCULAR TELEGRAM AGAINST THE KUOMINTAITG SIGNING AN AGREEMENT TO SELL VOOSUNG- SHANGHAI
9 May 1932
The capitulation of the counterrevolutionary Kuomintang government &quot; before imperialism and its &quot; betrayal of the national interests are being carried on even more unabashedly and openly .
On 5 May , the Kuomintang government signed a so @-@ called cease @-@ fire agreement with Japan and all other imperialist countries .
This agreement is the outright selling of Shanghai . , center of the proletariat of China , In the agreement , Japan is allowed to amass great numbers of its naval , army , and air forces in Shanghai on a long @-@ term &quot; basis , while Chinese troops can never be stationed in the surrounding areas of Shanghai .
In actual fact , this is an unlimited expansion of the area of Shanghai &apos;s International Settlement and a concrete step to &quot; bring about the conversion of Shanghai into a free city under international control .
This kind of shameless capitulation and overt act of &quot; betrayal show up even more clearly the Kuomintang government as traitors in the partition of China &quot; by imperialist countries and as &quot; trail blazers &quot; in the invasion of China &quot; by the imperialists .
And yet , at the same time , the Kuomintang government , under the direction of the imperialists , has concentrated all its strength to attack the Soviet Area , which has long gained liberation and extricated itself from the fetters of the imperialists , and try preventing the Workers and Peasants &apos; Red Army from carrying on its anti @-@ imperialist national revolutionary war .
In the course of the Shanghai negotiations and signing of the agreement , it has been exposed even more thoroughly that the League of Nations is the organizer of the partition of China and that all imperialist countries alike are cooperators of Japanese imperialism and proponents of the partition of China .
The Soviet Provisional Central Government hereby proclaims &quot; before the toiling masses of China that as representative of the toiling masses all over the country : it renounces the negotiations and secret agreements entered into &quot; by the counterrevolutionary Kuomintang government with Japan and all other imperialist countries and the May 5th cease @-@ fire agreement signed by the traitorous Kuomintang government ; it calls upon the toiling masses
throughout the country to rise resolutely to wage a revolutionary national war against Japanese imperialism and all other imperialist countries , and oppose the running dogs and &quot; trail &quot; blazers &quot; of the imperialists--the Kuomintang governmentin order to maintain China &apos;s territorial integrity and seels : the complete independence and liberation of China .
The Soviet Provisional Central Government calls upon the toiling masses all over the country to rise in struggle , arm themselves , and support the victorious assaults of the Chinese Workers and Peasants1 Red Army to overthrow the counterrevolutionary government of the Kuomintang , and under the Soviet banner , carry out resolutely and thoroughly a national revolutionary war .
Struggle for the liberation and independence of the Chinese nation !
Struggle for a free and independent Soviet China !

TELEGRAM FROM THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TO THE HUNAN- KLANGSI PROVINCIAL tfGRKER- .
PEASANT- SOLDIER CONGRESS
9 June 1932
Hunan- Kiangsi Provincial Soviet for transmittal to the Provincial Worker @-@ Peasant @-@ Soldier Congress
Comrade Representatives &apos; .
Due to transportation problems , the Soviet Provisional Central Government could not send representatives to attend your congress .
It can only send you a &quot; brief directive telegram .
Today , at a time when imperialist countries are frantically carrying on a war against the Soviet Union and the partition of China , and the revolution in China is .celling progress , as evidenced in particular &quot; by the several unprecedented victories of the Soviet Red Army , , the imperialist countries have turned from secret intervention to direct armed suppression of the Chinese revolution .
The rule of the Kuomintang is disintegrating .
But to continue &quot; betraying China and act as &quot; trail blazers &quot; for the imperialists , and save itself from demise , , it is conducting new frenzied attacks on Soviet areas and the Red Army all over the country .
Now the time has arrived for revolution and counterrevolution to engage in a struggle to the death , now the stage has been reached for the civil war in China to turn into an all @-@ out war against imperialism .
The balance of class strength has been altered and is now even more favorable to the development of Soviet revolution .
At present , the Soviets are adopting a positive course of liquidating the offensive of the imperialists and Kuomintang with a series of revolutionary attacks .
It is to mobilize and arm .
the masses to the maximum and implement completely the Central Government &apos;s mobilization order on the occasion of the declaration of war against Japan to win an initial victory by capturing Kiangsi and its neighboring provinces .
h- .
Your congress should carry on all its work under this task , set an even more concrete course of action to mobilize and prepare the masses to join Red fighters in the struggle against imperialism and to overthrow the Kuomintang rule ^ draw up an even more specific plan to Sovietize the western &quot; bank of the Kan River and capture Kan @-@ chou , Chi @-@ an . , and Nan @-@ ch &apos;ang in coordination with the Red Army and the Kiangsi Provincial Soviet .
The congress should arrive at a very concrete decision regarding making a bid to expand the Red Army and implement regulations for the preferential treatment of the Red Army , and should sufficiently discuss the &quot; building up of regional armed forces and the development of guerrilla warfare ^ extending the Soviet areas , , and reinforcing the leadership in all vork and struggles in the White areas .
To enhance the enthusiasm in struggle of the toiling masses ^ the workers and peasants ^ it is imperative to implement thoroughly the Soviet government program .
The congress should enforce the Labor law in its entirety and carry out land inspection to see whether or not the Land Law is being implemented in full .
It should carry out agrarian construction and raise production in a planned way .
7- Consolidate urban and rural congresses ^ bring about a genuine democratic system ^ and draw the masses of workers and peasants into taking part in the government and its work .
On the question of suppression of counterrevolutionaries ^ apart from implementing correctly Order No 6y the congress should prevent the mistake of another abandonment of the suppression of counterrevolutionaries .
But the handling of workers and peasants who unconsciously joined all sorts of covert and fraudulent organizations ( such as opium @-@ smoking clubs and lovers &apos; societies ) should not be put on a par with the handling of elements who consciously or knowlingly joined the AB Group .
There should be a difference .
We should not judge the former category of people guilty of having formally joined a counterrevolutionary organisation .
Only in this way can we win over the masses who have been deceived into unconsciously joining covert organizations and prevent counterrevolutionaries from intimidating them into falling into their schemes .
It is necessary to take stringent measures to rectify past mistakes of inciting the masses to go and grab rice from the White areas .
These things have impaired faith in the Soviets and increased the antipathy of the masses in the White areas ^ and have been made capital of by the counterrevolutionaries The grain and rice of landlords in the White areas for the most part should be distributed among the masses of workers and peasants locally .
Only a part of it should be used to aid the Red Army and a part to aid people in Soviet areas who have been trampled underfoot and suffer from a shortage of rice .
But this should still be publicized among the masses in the White areas .
The Provincial Soviet in the past classified opposition against rich peasants into pre @-@ revolutionary and post @-@ revolutionary .
This is extremely erroneous .
The congress mast repudiate this kind of theory .
That the masses did not take an active part in production in the past was essentially the evil consequence of exacting fines and levying contributions impermissibly without regard to classes , and not of opposing exploitation by rich peasants .
Implement the economic policy correctly so as to enlarge the financial resources and establish an economic base for expanding the revolutionary -war .
Develop the economy , improve tax collection , and organize guerrilla units to raise funds in the White areas on the one hand ^ and on the other hand , present ways and means to &quot; cut down expenses to provide for -war expenditures , &quot; punish severely corruption and wasteful acts , and put into effect a truly unified financial system so as to relieve the Red Army gradually of its official fund @-@ raising task and enable it to concentrate solely on carrying on the revolutionary war .
To carry out thoroughly all this -work , it is necessary to enforce a work inspection system so as to eradicate bureaucratism , corruption and degeneration , passivity and sabotage , It was wrong that the Provincial Soviet did not set up a worker @-@ peasant inspection department in the past .
The different levels of government must now establish such a department in accordance with the regulations to be promulgated at this congress , elect veteran Communist Party members who have had a long history of struggle and are activists to serve in it , and call upon the broad masses of workers and peasants and mass organizations to take part in this work .
13- The congress must thoroughly review the past work of the Provincial Soviet and of the government at different levels .
It must mercilessly bring to light all mistakes made in the work before it can implement correctly all resolutions and orders of the National Soviet Congress and the Central Government and accomplish vhat should be its tasks .
Finally , we wish success to your congress .

No department of internal affairs is set up in districts .
Administratively , the different levels of the department of internal affairs are placed under the direct authority of the department of internal affairs of a higher level , thus establishing a direct systematic relationship , and absolutely act under the order of that department .
However , at the same time , they are subjected to the guidance of the presidium of the government of the same level ; thus creating a lateral relationship .
A department of internal affairs may organize a committee on internal affairs to be composed of three to nine members .
After the election of the director of a lower- level department of internal affairs by the Soviet congress of the same level , his name must be submitted to the department of internal affairs of a higher level for approval .
h- .
For the time being , the department of internal affairs has charge of municipal administration , , people &apos;s police , , criminal cases , criminal investigation , public health , communication , post and telecommunicationSj food , social security , census , registration of births and deaths , and of marriages , etc .

A municipal Soviet will establish an administrative division to administer the people &apos;s police and concurrently handle criminal investigation .
Bigger cities will set up a division of municipal administration and an administrative division to have charge of city administration , people &apos;s police , and criminal investigation .
In the Department of Internal Affairs in the Central Government , apart from the director and deputy director , there is a head for each of the six directorates , and in the provinces a head for each of the five divisions , namely : administrative , municipal administration , communication , public health , and social security .

ON CONTINUING THE EEFOEM OF LOCAL SOVIET GOVERNMENTS Directive No 15 of the Central Executive Committee
20 September 1932
At a time when the current revolutionary war is developing sharply . , the central task of the Soviets is to lead and expand the revolutionary war and every kind of work should center around the war .
All sacrifices made will he for winning total victory in the war and to improve and consolidate the leadership of the Soviets is a basic condition for winning total victory in the war .
The local Soviets have gone through a complete reform and they have made partial progress in their work .
However , it has come to light that in the central task of leading and expanding the revolutionary war , the leadership of the local Soviets is weak and that many mistakes have &quot; been committed .
First of all , they have not centered their work around the war .
For this reason , in many places they have not actively proceeded with expanding the Red Army and mobilising the masses to go to the front and join in the fighting .
Some have not resolutely carried out attacks against the enemy in their leadership of the regional armed forces .
Take , for example , the Lung @-@ yai Revolutionary Military Committee and the Ch &apos;ang @-@ t &apos;ing County Soviet .
Both not only did not tenaciously lead the masses in engaging the enemy in resolute struggle , &quot; but they shrank back and fled , with the result that the soviet areas suffered considerable losses .
They did not pay heed to the political leadership of guerrilla units , creating serious manifestations of Red @-@ White antagonism .
They did not even take a firm step to expand the soviet areas and consolidate newly won soviet areas .
Such facts as these fully show that the soviet governments in some places are not sound and that they do not perform their tasks determinedly .
This is exceedingly detrimental to the development and victory of the revolutionary war .
Looking at the soviet governments themselves , we have noticed that there still are alien class elements hidden in some of them and that other governments are still displaying a non @-@ class line to the fullest .
This non @-@ class line has frequently been manifested in questions concerning land and protection for workers .
$ fe , nife stations of bureaucratic degeneration are developing in a number of local soviet government .
Manifestations of corruption are still very serious .
Their methods of work often are divorced
from the masses .
Mostly , they adopt the method of Issuing an order and compeling the masses to carry it out .
They haye not fully implemented the regulations governing the preferential treatment of the Red Army , thereby impeding the &quot; work of expanding the Red Army .
They have disregarded women &apos;s rights and unrealistically implemented the marriage regulations , thereby obstructing women from participating in revolutionary work .
Lower @-@ level governments do not pay attention to orders from a higher @-@ level government and merely perform their &quot; work perfunctorily .
Regular congresses of urban and rural Soviets have not been set up .
In the worst cases , some rural Soviets close their doors and do no work .
In all the work , the majority of them only have the name , &quot; but not the work .
All these manifestations and mistakes show that the local Soviets are not sound and cannot have the strength to undertake the task of leading the revolutionary war .
In order to strengthen the leadership of the soviet governments in the revolutionary war and eliminate all mistakes and shortcomings in the work of the Soviets , it has been resolved to continue to re @-@ elect and reform the local soviet governments .
Through re @-@ elections we will clear the Soviets of non @-@ class alien elements and all other elements who are passive saboteurs of revolutionary war work , drive corrupt and degenerate bureaucratic elements out of the Soviets , admit activists as new cadres , and set up strong and capable soviet governments to carry out realistically the task and work of leading the revolutionary war .
The election procedure this time is not to conduct elections at the different levels of government in the Fukin and Kiangsi provincial Soviets simultaneously , but to hold separate elections with the counties as a unit .
This is because now is the time to expand the revolutionary war and if elections are carried out simultaneously in all places , the governments will devote all their energy to the work of conducting re @-@ elections and this will necessarily cause the work of expanding the revolutionary war to come to a standstill and thus vill be of no advantage to the revolutionary war .
As to the main criterion of re @-@ election , hov a government performs its work in leading the revolutionary war will decide whether the re @-@ election of the government will be a complete one or partial .
Below are two lists of names of counties , one calling for a complete re @-@ election and the other for a partial re @-@ election :
Complete re @-@ election : In Kaangsi--Nan @-@ kuang , Shih @-@ ch &apos;eng , Hui @-@ chTang , Hsun @-@ wu , An @-@ yuan , Yu @-@ tu , and Yung @-@ feng .
In Fukien--Chlang @-@ t &apos;ing , Ning @-@ hua , Hsin @-@ ch &apos;uan , and Wu @-@ p &apos;ing .
In Lung @-@ yai a county soviet government will be set up formally .
Partial re @-@ election : In Kiangsi--Hsing @-@ kuo , Sheng @-@ li , Ulng @-@ tu , Kang @-@ lueh , Kan @-@ hsien , Lo @-@ an , and Wan @-@ t &apos;ai .
In Fukien--Yung @-@ ting , Shang @-@ hang , and Jui @-@ chln counties directly under the central authority .
In this re @-@ election ^ we should mobilize the masses to participate in the re @-@ election campaign and review and criticize the work of the Soviets through developing the revolutionary war .
We should make the re @-@ election
campaign serve as an actual mobilisation to arouse the masses to expand the Red Army and take part in frontline work so as to set right past peaceful re @-@ elections and election campaigns that were removed from the war .
In thjs re @-@ election _ , the different levels of the government should pay special attention to drawing activists among the workers into joining county congresses and district and county executive committees so as to reinforce the worker composition of the different levels of the Soviets .
Upon receipt of this directive ^ the different levels of the soviet government should immediately make preparations for re @-@ election .
The period of re @-@ election shall be determined &quot; by the Soviets of the two provinces of Kiangsi and Fukien and the Presidium of the Soviet of Jui @-@ chin county directly under the central authority .
Ike re @-@ election forinalities will still &quot; be in accordance with the provisions of the election , by @-@ laws .
Such is the order .

November 7 this year is the first anniversary of the establishment of the Provisional Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic and at the same time ^ the 15th anniversary of the victory of the October Revolution of the Soviet Union , In the past year , internationally the revolutionary situation in China has made the greatest progress and socialist construction in the Soviet Union has gained great success , intensifying all the more the collapse of the capitalist world and the development of world revolution .
In this past year , the imperialist war against the Soviet Union and the partition of China have reached an unprecedented critical state .
Since the establishment of a nation @-@ wide unified organ of leadershipthe Provisional Central Governmentthe Chinese soviet movement has achieved unprecedented success and growth .
Under the leadership of the Central Government . , the Workers and Peasants &apos; Red Army throughout the country has continued to score unprecedented victories in the revolutionary war &quot; by annihilating &quot; between 10 and 20 divisions of the Kuomintang army5 expanding the most extensive soviet areas , and unfolding a new phase in the national revolutionary &quot; war all over the country .

TELEGRAM AGAINST THE REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATION DELEGATION
6 October 1932
&#91; Text &#93; All Chinese workers , peasants and soldiers and all oppressed masses !
The Provisional Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic has long since proclaimed to the masses of all China that the League of Nations is a bandits1 alliance of the imperialist countries to dismember China , and that the main purpose for which it has sent LyttonTs investigation delegation to China is to plan for the dismemberment of China and the suppression of all revolutionary activity under the banner of the Chinese Soviets .
Now the report of the imperialist bandit alliance &apos;s investigation delegation the Lytton Commissionconcerning the dismemberment of China has been published .
It is a tragic whitewash of the dismemberment of China presented to the Chinese masses by imperialismand those traitors who disgrace their country , the Kuomintang and their government , entirely agree with and accept it !
The Lytton Commission report has publicly and quite shamelessly proclaimed a new plan for the dismemberment of China ; it openly declares that Japan and all the imperialists should not only occupy Manchuria but should dismember the whole of Chinas and it clearly declares that Japanese imperialism &apos;s occupation of Manchuria and its bloodbath in Shanghai were justified .
It calls for all imperialists to unite to dismember China and destroy the Chinese revolutionary movement , starting with an even crueller attack upon the countrywide national revolutionary war and local revolutionary movements led by the Chinese Soviet Government , upon the anti @-@ Japanese war of the Manchurian volunteers , and upon anti @-@ Japanese , anti @-@ imperialist and goods boycott movements .
It shamelessly advocates the status of &quot; autonomous nation &quot; for Manchuria , the setting up of an international gendarmerie to make it a base for international &apos;imperialism &apos;s attack upon the Soviet Union , for active attack on the Soviet Union .
At the same time , it uses phrases such as &quot; suzerainty rests with China &quot; in the hopes of relieving the Chinese masses of their anti @-@ imperialist armor and benumbing them .
Finally , it repeatedly orders the Kuomintang to more actively attack the Red Army , to surrender more faithfully to imperialism and sell out national interests , to strive even harder to suppress the anti @-@ imperialist movement and the goods boycott movement , and to cruelly butcher the Chinese masses ! ...
_ _ _
The Lytton Commission &apos;s report is a certification of imperialist enslavement of the Chinese people .
The Soviet Government calls upon the masses of the entire country to arm themselves and , under the leadership of the Soviet Government , tear the Lytton report to shreds with a revolutionary national war , and to oppose all of the imperialists &apos; new schemes to dismember China , to attack the Soviet areas , to suppress the Chinese revolution and to attack the Soviet Union !
Drive the Japanese and all imperialists out of China and gain complete liberation and independence for the Chinese people !
Protect the Soviet Union by force of arms and establish a social alliance between ChinaTs laboring masses and the Soviet Union . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
The Soviet Government declares to workers , peasants and soldiers throughout the country and to all oppressed masses that to truly carry on a national revolutionary war and to oppose imperialists dismemberment of China , we must begin by overthrowing the scavengers of imperialist dismemberment of China and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang , which represses the nationalist war .
The Kuomintang and its government have , with complete loyalty , accepted the imperialists &apos; report on the dismemberment of China , have accepted it as a basis for discussion , and all discussions and studies of it by Kuomintang factions and the government , as well as verbal expressions of dissatisfaction with certain points in the report are without exception a smokescreen to cover up their betrayal of China and a trick to deceive the masses .
The Kuomintang is willing to give the Three Eastern Provinces , Shanghair , and the rest of China to the imperialists and mobilize a huge array , with the direction and help of the imperialists , to attack the worker and peasant army which is truly leading the revolutionary masses of the entire country in a revolutionary nationalist war , hoping in this way to destroy the Soviet Government of the true anti @-@ imperialist masses and prevent the Red Army and the heroic anti @-@ imperialist fighters and volunteers from standing together to make war directly upon the imperialists .
At the same time , it assists the imperialists by slaughtering and betraying the Manchurian volunteers , repressing the nationwide anti @-@ imperialist movement , restraining the goods boycott movement and the workers1 strikes , and slaughtering the workers and peasants and the laboring masses in order to prove its loyalty to imperialism .
Only by overthrowing the Kuomintang rule which has sold out our national interests can we prosecute the national revolutionary war in a workable manner .
The Soviet Government is now leading the Worker and Peasant Red Army of the entire nation and the broad range of laboring masses in the Soviet zones in a bitter war against the imperialist Kuomintang to victoriously smash the Kuomintang &apos;s fourth campaign and is destroying the reactionary &apos;rule of the Kuomintang with revolutionary war !
Masses of the entire nation , arm yourselves !
Oppose the Kuomintang &apos;s fourth campaign on the Soviet zones , overthrow the rule of the Kuoraintang , the lackeys of imperialism , and support the Red Army and Soviet power !
Only the Soviet Government can truly lead a nationwide revolutionary war , fight directly against Japan and oppose the imperialists1 dismemberment of China !
Only the Worker and Peasant Red Army is truly arming the masses for a nationalist war !
Fighters of the Worker and Peasant Red Army throughout the country , and laboring worker @-@ peasant masses in the Soviet zones !
Actively carry on revolutionary war against the imperialist Kuomintang and resolutely attack and smash the fourth .l &apos;eric ^ irc _ lement _ and suppression campaigns ! &quot;
Workers , peasants and soldiers everywhere in the White areas , and all suffering masses &apos; .
Take the initiative in arming yourselves , organizing militias , staging strikes and carrying on goods boycotts , and struggle actively against the imperialist Kuornintang ; all revoutionary masses rise together under the Soviet banner to wage a national revolutionary war , to oppose imperialist dismemberment of China , to overthrow Kuomintang rule , to drive the Japanese imperialists and all other imperialists out of China , to set up a Soviet Government of the masses of all China , and to complete the independence and liberation of the Chinese people !

ON EMERGENCY MOBILIZATION FOR WAR
Order No 12 of Central Executive Committee
13 October 1932
&#91; Text &#93; The revolution is becoming daily more intense throughout the country , and the Soviets and the Red Army in particular have won unprecedentedly great victories and more unprecedented progress throughout the country , so that the imperialist Kuomintang &apos;s fourth encirclement campaign in 0 @-@ Hsiang @-@ Yuan , Hsiang @-@ o @-@ hsi , Hsiang @-@ tung @-@ pei and Hsiang @-@ o @-@ chiang has met with crushing defeat after defeat .
Most notably , the Red Army in the Central District rolled victoriously northward , and as a result the Kuomintang warlords , under the strict supervision of the imperialists , are now devoting their full strength to deployments for a large @-@ scale attack against the Central District , 1 and intensifying their attacks on Kau @-@ tung @-@ pei , Hsiang @-@ ok @-@ kan and Ho @-@ hsi ; this is because in view of the revolution &apos;s victories and the reactionary ruling class is planning to put all its strength into a final effort which represents a critical point of decisive struggle between revolution and counterrevolution ,
This class war will be more intense and graver than any previous war and accordingly we must mobilize all our workers and peasants and laboring masses to arm themselves and quickly become a powerful Red Army force , and to prepare with all their strength , all their economic resources and all their sacrifice for a war to smash the enemy &apos;s large @-@ scale campaign in the course of the victory in this war , we shall take the urban centers of Chis Hsiang , Fu , and Nan , and realize our initial victory in Kiangsi and the several neighboring provinces .
In order to lead the worker @-@ peasant masses and armed organizations of the entire country in smashing the imperialist Kuomintang &apos;s all @-@ out attack on the central region the fourth encirclement campaign throughout the country , the Central Government is carrying out an emergency general wartime mobilization , in particular with reference to the Worker and Peasant Red Army units and all worker @-@ peasant laboring masses in Soviet areas throughout the country , to carry out a resolute attack , with the most positive and rapid action and the broadest and most thorough military mobilization , in order to guarantee the complete success of this war .
Accordingly , governments at all levels , all Red Army units , and all military districts must resolutely and rapidly carry out the following mobilization work : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ . _
Urgently mobilize all ? worker @-@ peasant laboring masses to struggle energetically for victory with the most positive revolutionary enthusiasm and practical activity ; to this end , the governments at all levels shall carry out a thorough political mobilization of the worker @-@ peasant masses in all Soviet areas so that every worker @-@ peasant element understands the significance of this campaign for his own future and that it is a decisive movement for the country @-@ wide victory of the Soviets , and recognizes that the fundamental conditions for the victory of our class war are the swelling of the struggle against counterrevolution &quot; by all revolutionary forces in the country , so as to stimulate the worker @-@ peasant massesT fighting enthusiasm and class _ _ _ .
determination and make them actively prepare for and participate in all practical work of the campaign , in the front lines and the rear areas , and struggle to smash the enemy &apos;s large @-@ scale attack .
Accordingly :
( a ) All personnel of the provincial and Soviet area governments are to go immediately to the lower levels and convene assemblies there , in particular the urban and rural representative assemblies and electoral assemblies to undertake political mobilization , so that all working personnel and all worker and peasant comrades will understand the significance of this war , and will all be mobilized to take part in all mobilization activities of the war .
( b ) In all Red Army units , their highest leadership organs shall convene soldiers &apos; meetings in accordance with their particular situation , to carry out a general mobilization of all fighters .
( c ) In all local armed associations , the military district military departments , and those at all other levels , shall hold meetings of their Red Guards , guerrillas , and Young Pioneers groups .
( d ) All mass groups shall , under this general mobilization order , respectively hold plenary meetings and make agitation reports .
All Red Army units shalls in accordance with established policy and mounting the most positive and adroit attacks , first defeat the enemy &apos;s attacks and smash the enemy &apos;s all @-@ out attack with victorious attacks of their own , so as to seize control of urban centers and &apos;realize the initial victory in Kiangsi ; in particular , the Red Army units throughout the country must act in coordination ,
An intensive expansion of the Red Army strengthens the main force of the revolutionary war , and this is a main condition for smashing the enemy &apos;s all @-@ out assault .
In October , governments at all levels must , with the greatest energy and rapidity , mobilize the broadest range of worker and peasant activist elements to swell the Red Army &apos;s numbers and improve its quality .
They must resolutely carry out the Central Committee &apos;s Directive No 15 and must also more than double the prescribed numbers , and thereafter must continually carry on activities to expand the Red Army , constantly replenishing the front lines on a large @-@ scale and setting up regular Red Army reserve units .
In addition , governments at all levels are charged with mobilizing and urging soldiers who have been demobilized and have returned home to all return to their units during October , and with initiating an extremely broad return @-@ to ~ the @-@ units movement among the masses . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ .
_ _ . _ _ _ _ _ _ ... _ _ _ .. , . _ .
Persevere in carrying out Directive No 15 and quickly mobilize all able @-@ bodied men between 18 and 40 years of age in all Soviet areas to volunteer to join the Red Guards , each man must provide himself with a weapon , prepare sights for local weapons and artillery and ready a sufficient supply of ammunition ( in addition , the Young Pioneers must be set up extensively ) ; they must be organized and set up as units in accordance with regulations ; this work must be completed before the revolutionary holiday in October .
Political education and combat training must be especially intensified .
Governments at all levels , and all military districts and all military departments , must painstakingly undertake the implementation of this Directive so that the Red Guards will truly be able to shoulder the task of protecting their localities and coordinating with the Red Army in destroying and striking back at the attacking enemy ; model eamps and model Young Pioneers groups must be ready at all times to move out and to assemble for combat .
Set up powerful guerrilla units .
All existing guerrilla units must be subjected to strict investigation and bad elements among their personnel must immediately be purged and guerrilla units &apos; leadership must be strengthened or replaced .
During October each guerrilla unit must take a week &apos;s training in rotation and strengthen its political and military education , so that every member of the unit knows the work and missions he is charged with .
Each country must have at least one or two crack guerrilla units to go into neighboring White areas and the enemy &apos;s rear and carry on the broadest kind of guerrilla war , whipping up mass struggle and extending the Soviet areas ; they will be the Soviet areas &apos; armed organizers and propagandizes .
They will become an extremely critical force in the revolutionary war , able to coordinate with the Red Army in applying pressure and attacking the enemy ; they will resolutely erase all serious phenomena of guerrilla units .
Each county must have them thoroughly organized and put in order during October so that they can all go into action according to the directives and missions which have been planned by the Military Service Committee .
In order to facilitate the destruction of the enemy and to win the initial victory in Kiangsi , we must actively develop the surrounding Soviet areas , in particular those in the north and east , as well as those in the northeast .
This is a critical prerequisite for winning a victory and for realizing the initial victory in Kiangsi .
Governments at all levels and armed units in all localities must immediately mobilize personnel to go to these fronts and develop the Soviet areas to win over the broad worker @-@ peasant masses , to create an even more extensive Soviet area * to surround every urban center and the environs of any urban center that serve the enemy as a strong point ; to establish close relationships with Northeast Kiangsi and Ho @-@ hsi , and with more thorough planning , to go and carry on work among the soldiers of the White armies surrounding the Soviet areas , so as to shatter the enemy &apos;s armies , win over the revolutionary masses of the soldiers , and set up activities in the neighboring urban centers .
All provincial and county governments must , in October , transfer large numbers of cadres to these new areas in order to establish political power and carry out the land revolution , so as to carry on work in the White areas and with the White army soldiers , and at the same time , must deepen the class struggle in all the border areas , consolidate and expand them . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ . _ _
We must immediately collect the land tax , the business tax and the house rents so as to develop our financial resources , and must thoroughly ready our economic and food resources for warfare , along with all military necessities , and prepare for a .
protracted struggle witjv the enemy , so that
Red Army and all worker ^ peasant masses will not be troubled by being bottled up by the enemy and short &quot; on provisionsj even more ?
we must continue to save OD . &apos; expenses and food , in order to make ample &apos;war preparations .
This is of critical importance to our victory or defeat in the decisive war .
Mobilize all worker ^ peasant masses to store food and salt and to cut waste of food , to make an effort in &apos; the growing of miscellaneous grains and vegetables and to prepare to supply the Red Army during wartime .
The enthusiasm for revolutionary war and support for the RedNArmy of the worker @-@ peasant masses in all the soviet areas should be encouraged politically , and preparation and storage of economic resources and food should be thoroughly carried out , in order to gain victory in war and to be prepared at any time to lend or contribute to the Red Army .
We must persist in destroying the advancing enemy so that our soviet areas will not be overrun .
If the enemy is able to enter and harass soviet areas , we must persevere in leading the worker @-@ peasant masses and arming them in hitting the enemy and destroying him .
We must cut off his food supplies and communications , harass him day and night , strengthen our bulwarks and leave nothing outside them , so that the enemy cannot continue for a moment in the Soviet areas .
All local governments must lead the local armed organizations and worker @-@ peasant masses in active execution of all kinds of preparations , making use of our experience of the past three campaigns , so that we will attain a more thorough and effective achievement and will be victorious .
All Soviet areas must institute the strictest sort of Red martial law , and all sentries shall be the responsibility of the Red Guards .
They must be set up within 10 days so as to stringently guard against penetration by enemy reconnaissance , and must scrupulously check all travelers and all materials brought with them .
Any suspicious cases must be brought to the government organs for thorough investigation .
The governments at all levels shall issue travel permits only after detailed investigation and certification .
They must not issue them carelessly .
The previous practice of stamping a mark on the hand is to be abandoned .
All mass organizations must obtain travel passes from the government , and only the government and military organs of the government can issue them .
Travel permits for travel through the white areas must be issued by the county or district governments .
A house @-@ to @-@ house check of all Soviet areas must immediately be carried out , and in particular all suspicious elements in the urban areas must be subjected to intensive investigation and surveillance .
For this work , government at all levels shall have the particupation and assistance of the labor unions , Young Pioneers and all mass organizations .
Intensify the purge of counterrevolutionaries .
The National Security Office is charged with instructing its branch units at all levels to make painstaking plans to carry out this work , and at the same time government at all levels must deal severely with all counterrevolutionary activities , in particular the counties of Shih Ch &apos;eng , &#91; 4258 1004 &#93; , Ning @-@ tu &#91; 1337 6757 &#93; , Kuang @-@ ch &apos;ang &#91; 1639 2490 &#93; , I @-@ huang &#91; 1355 7806 &#93; , Hing @-@ hua &#91; 1337 0553 &#93; , Hui @-@ ch &apos;ang

In the combat zones these elements must be arrested .
In order to set up a more consolidated rear area we must thoroughly purge all counterrevolutionary factions and suppress all counterrevolutionary activities .
We must actively revamp our main communication lines to make them more conducive to military transport and troop movements .
We must institute strong logistics depot activities and logistics depot transportation , and all governmental units within 30 li of the depots in either direction will be charged with transport and protection reponsibility .
The Red Guards along the line shall become armed units for protection and escort .
As to means of transportation , we shall change the past designation of the various organizations and unite them under the Red Guards .
We have resolved that every member of Red Guard unit shall have a weapon and a carrying pole ; one stretcher for every five men so that if combat occurs they may all attack the enemy with weapons and if the front lines or logistics depots need stretcher bearers or transportation teams , all Red Guards can become transportation teams or stretcher bearers ; only with such a rapid mobilization can we adapt to the intense needs of combat .
The relevant government units shall mobilize the broad masses during October to completely pull down all works built by the enemy in the soviet areas during the three campaigns and not yet destroyed , and the city walls of all cities .
During wartime , government at all levels must persevere in leading the masses and the armed units in resolutely doing battle with the enemy , and if there are those who are faint @-@ hearted and flee and do not persistenly lead the masses in combat , they must be dealt with according to military discipline , In addition , in order to intensify the combat leadership strength of the various governments , all the working personnel of the various governments shall receive military training , and the district and township government personnel shall participate in the Red Guards with leadership responsibility ; at the province and county levels they must , in coordination with the working personnel of the various organs and organizations at the same level , set up a Red Guards organization to regularly carry out military training , so that all life and activity shall be militarized .
This will more practically strengthen the leadership of the governments at various levels over the combat activities of the local armed units .
The situation of the war is becoming daily more urgent , and we must use our full strength in mobilizing the worker &quot; peasant masses of all soviet areas , and must , with the greatest rapidity , thoroughly prepare &quot; for &quot; all combat activities and prepare to make every sacrifice to gain a military victory , subordinating all activities to the war .
This time , victory will assuredly belong to us .
It is so ordered .

ON THE SECOND ISSUE OF REVOLUTIONARY WAR BONDS Directive No 17 of Central Executive Committee 21 October 1932
&#91; Text &#93; Because the revolution is developing particularly because of the victorious development of the Soviets and the Red Army , the enemy is now devoting his entire energy to an intensified deployment for a large @-@ scale assault against the Central District .
In addition to issuing an order for emergency wartime mobilization in order to lead the worker @-@ peasant masses of all Soviet areas in thoroughly smashing the enemyfs large @-@ scale attack and realizing the initial victory in Kiangsi , the Central Government , in order to facilitate the thorough guaranteeing of a complete victory in this war and thorough preparation of economic resources for war , and in particular to mobilize all worker @-@ peasant masses to complete this preparation more quickly , is taking the step of issuing a second series of revolutionary war bonds in the amount of 1,200,000 yuan , for the specific purpose of meeting the costs of the war .
On receipt of this directive , governments at all levels must , on the basis of previous experience , immediately discuss the method of selling them and put it into practice within a short time .

Means of mobilizing the masses .
( a ) Use propaganda and agitation , agitate the worker @-@ peasant masses to take the initiative in buying them .
Orders or coercion must absolutely not be used .
But rich peasants and large and middle merchants can be designated in advance , and ordered to buy them .
( b ) The areas . , cities and hsiang should convene the township representatives assemblies to make a report and discussion .
As to the methods of sale and of encouraging the masses , the urban and rural governments and representatives should convene mass meeting , of the electorate and report on the significance of the government &apos;s bond issue and the duties of citizens .
It is important that they should agitate them politically about participating in the revolutionary war so that the masses will take the initiative in buying them .
( c ) Use of revolutionary emulation .
County will compete with county district with district , township with township , village with village , and group with group , and the one that sells the most the quickest wins .
The government at the next higher level should award a pennant and a prize . _ _
( d ) It shall be the responsibility of the village or city representative and the urban and rural governments to turn over the collected funds to the higher level .
( e ) Governments at all levels shall , in accordance with the above , determine the concrete methods of implementation , i.e. , methods of distribution , agitation , and collection .
To sum up , the bond issue can be completely carried out according to the above regulations , but it depends most importantly upon how we decide upon our work of mobilizing and agitating the masses ; whoever can actively mobilize the masses will be able to accomplish his mission .
We must stringently correct the past erroneous procedures of not mobilizing the masses and relying exclusively on orders .
The second bond issue is entirely for the needs of the war to thoroughly smash the enemy &apos;s large @-@ scale attack .
After the autumn &apos;harvest , the wqrker &apos; -peasant laboring passes and the inhabitants are economically more active , and following the first bond issue in particular the credit of the bond certificates had an easier time gaining the support of the masses .
So , governments at all levels should , on the basis of past experience , make a great effort to agitate the masses , and resolutely correct the past erroneous method of giving orders and designating people without going through any propaganda and agitation .
Each locality must at all costs sell the bonds on time and deliver the receipts by the deadline , in order to fulfil their revolutionary task .
If half @-@ hearted workers and saboteurs are discovered again as they were last time , they shall be punished according to revolutionary discipline .
This is most expressly ordered !

ORGANIZE LABOR TEAMS WITH RICH PEASANTS
Order No 35
25 November 1932
&#91; Text &#93; At this period of tension in the revolutionary war , pressing tasks are many in order to lessen the burden of the combat tasks of the worker @-@ peasant masses , we have decided to organize the rich peasants into work teams under the surveillance of the Red Guard to take on various types of labor service in the Soviet areas , such as tearing down city walls and works , repairing roads and internal transportation ; these labor teams are to be made up out by compulsory levy of rich peasants .
Overall treatment of them shall also differ from ordinary teams , as follows :
The various local governments must form all rich peasants able to work into labor teams , and at work time dispatch the Red Guards to oversee them ( one Red Guard overseer per 5 workers ) .
They must be sent immediately to tear down the city walls and earthworks and destroy the works which were previously put up in the Soviet areas by the enemy , and to repair the roads and bridges .
Within the Soviet areas , the transportation along logistics depot routes and part of the moving of heavy objects shall be assigned to them .
As to the support of the labor teams , they must provide their own utensils and food , but if they are engaged in transportation work on trips lasting more than 2 days , the government may provide them with rice , but they themselves must carry money for vegetables .
It is imperative that each government unit shall immediately implement the above resolutions .
It is so ordered .

CULTIVATE MORE GRAIN AND PROHIBIT OPIUM CULTIVATIONNOTICE HO 13 OF PROVISIONAL CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
25 November 1932
&#91; Text &#93; At present , in order to continue the victorious pursuit of the revolutionary war and the protracted struggle , so as to thoroughly smash the enemy &apos;s large @-@ scale offensive , and to win even greater victories , we need to make thorough preparations in which food is particularly critical , not only affecting the provisioning of the Red Army but also directly influencing the daily life of the worker @-@ peasant masses .
Accordingly , the Provisional Central Government , in order to bolster the food supply and to keep the broad worker @-@ peasant masses and Red Army in the Soviets from suffering any hardship with respect to food , has made the following decisions :
Plant more miscellaneous grain and vegetables ; now is the time for planting miscellaneous grains , and the worker @-@ peasant masses in all localities should do their utmost to plant miscellaneous grains and vegetables to make up cereal shortages .
Forbid the cultivation of opium .
Opium is a most pernicious poison , and a tool used foy the evil gentry and landlords to benumb the workers and peasants .
In our Soviet areas we must absolutely forbid it .
Furthermore , since the cultivation hinders the cultivation of miscellaneous grains and the next year &apos;s spring planting and so decreases the source of grain and harms the revolutionary war , in all our Soviet areas this year we absolutely forbid further cultivation of opium .
It must be replaced by miscellaneous grains .
The above decision is entirely in the interest of the revolutionary war and of the worker @-@ peasant masses .
It must be strictly followed by everyone .
Recently we have heard that rich peasants are subverting from within , intentionally inciting the masses to plant opium , to decrease the food production in the Soviet areas and bring about grevious harm to the worker @-@ peasant masses .
This is indeed intentional subversion of the revolution , and accordingly is absolutely prohibited by the Soviet areas .
All local
governments and all revolutionary bodies and all the worker @-@ peasant masses must painstakingly investigate peasants who encourage the masses to grow opium ; rich peasants who intentionally subvert the revolution must be strictly investigated and given harsh punishment .
This is most earnestly communicated , and it is expected that governments at all levels , all mass organizations and all the worker @-@ peasant masses will be informed of it and will obey it implicitly .
It is so required .

ON MOBILIZATION FOR WAR AND THE STYLE OF WORKURGENT RESOLUTION OF CENTRAL PEOPLE &apos;S COMMITTEE
29 November 1932
&#91; Text &#93; The results of a recent investigation of the implementation of the emergency mobilization in the various localities have been quite unsatisfactory , Beyond the brief comments made by the War Service Committee in a letter addressed to the localities , the People &apos;s Committee points out more gravely that the primary factor in this state of affairs is errors in political understanding :
The gravity of the enemy &apos;s large @-@ scale assault has in general been taken too lightly , this reflects the extremely backward peace @-@ at @-@ any @-@ price attitude among the masses which holds that while the enemy is not here it is business as usual , and which naturally makes them unable to carry out urgent tasks .
In the border areas which have been subject to enemy invasion and harassment , there has been panic and disorganization .
This results from failing to understand the current situation , which is favorable to revolution , a lack of confidence in the revolution , and defeatist mood , and it hinders the carrying out of mobilization work ,
There is incorrect understanding of the attack policy ; people consider it to be solely the task of the Red Army , while they themselves sit by and hope for a Red Army victory .
In the border regions there is even more an attitude of depending on the Red Army and taking no active measures oneself to attack the enemy outside .
With this idea of waiting , it is impossible to carry out a policy of attack from all sides , and it results in the complete neglect of all emergency mobilization work .
The People &apos;s Committee calls upon governments at all levels and the local military leadership organs to carry on a resolute and ruthless struggle against these political errors , to oppose all under @-@ rating of the enemy &apos;s large @-@ scale offensive and particularly the backward consciousness of peace @-@ at @-@ any @-@ price that considers that the enemy is still far off , to resolutely oppose panic and disorganization in the face of enemy assaults and the conservative idea of waiting , for these things are the most dangerous to the implementation of the emergency mobilization to smash the enemy &apos;s large @-@ scale attacks . _ _ .. _ _ _ _
The People &apos;s Committee gravely calls upon governments at all levels and the local military leadership organs to arrive at a profound understanding of the enemy &apos;s current active building of motor roads , organization of military outposts and transport , organization and expansion of armed landlords , development of anti @-@ communist groups and communist eradication militia all around the Soviet areas , enforced collection of large sums for the army , and transfers of large numbers _ of troops .
Of particular importance , he has stepped up his attacks on Kan @-@ Tung @-@ Pei , Hsiang @-@ o @-@ Kan , and the Hsiang @-@ Kan Soviet area ; this is an indication of the enemy &apos;s ever more thorough deployment of his large @-@ scale attack on the central Soviet and his preparations for a protracted effort .
We must reach a profound understanding that this attack to smash the enemy &apos;s large @-@ scale assault will be a prolonged , hard and bitter struggle , a critical juncture in the class struggle .
We must devote all our strength to the struggle for victory in this war .
We must also point out that although this enemy attack has the direct assistance of imperialism and has increased its armed strength , politically and internally they are much weaker than in the third campaign , and the troops with which the enemy is attacking the Soviet areas are ripe with disaffection and indecisiveness .
The development of the nationwide revolution and the concurrent expansion and growth in strength of the Soviet Red Army are conditions especially beneficial to us ; if we can mobilize all our forces to make sacrifices for the war we can win a complete victory and realize our initial victory in Kiangsi .
In investigating mobilization work we discovered another grave state of affairs , namely a failure to mobilize the masses politically or move them organizationally , adopting instead a work style which is divorced from the masses and involves coercing them and ordering them around .
Furthermore the development of this work style is closely connected with the above @-@ mentioned political errors :
Having failed to understand the gravity of the enemy &apos;s large @-@ scale assault , they naturally cannot understand the importance of mobilizing the whole range of the worker @-@ peasant masses , and they do not proceed to the broad mobilization work on a foundation of mass mobilization .
Leadership organs at all levels , in dealing with subordinate officials , adopt a leadership style of simply issuing an order or sending down a resolution or a plan , with no indication or investigation of any of the concrete methods of carrying it out , or of the methods of mobilizing the masses .
On occasion , they even simply order that it be done , perhaps making use of threats or punishments .
This in turn causes the subordinates to coerce the masses even more , and cases of ordering the masses around are appearing everywhere .
If people have a haphazard and disorganized work style and do not make use of mass meetings of the electorate , representative assemblies , and all the various mass groups to mobilize the masses and strengthen mobilization of the masses , they will inevitably end up coercing the masses and ordering them around .
Because people have a bureaucratic work style , they are inevitably unable to take pains with the mobilization of the masses , but in an effort to find the easy way they resort to coercion and issuing orders instead . _
These phenomena have appeared quite frequently in the emergency mobilization .
It is quite clear that in responding to the Central Government &apos;s emergendy mobilization order , they have not convened congresses of the electorate , representative assemblies , and mass meetings of the Red Guards and the Young Pioneers and the various mass groups to make detailed reports and explanations and carry out thorough political agitation efforts ; even now a majority of the masses do not understand about the enemy &apos;s large @-@ scale assault , which naturally means that all the mobilization work is unable to stand on a foundation of mass activism and achieve full realization .
In expanding the Red Army , for example , we will not be able to fulfill the prescribed plans , will not be able to induce able @-@ bodied man and women of the worker @-@ peasant masses eagerly and spontaneously to join the Red Guards and the Young Pioneers , but rather will resort to threat of punishment to compel them to go to the drill field .
Of particular importance , in collecting the land tax and in issuing bonds , we did not do thorough political propagandizing in advance , to assure that all worker @-@ peasant elements understood why they should pay the land tax and buy bonds .
When we were collecting the tax and issuing the bonds we also failed to convene the various kinds of meetings and make use of the urban and rural representative assemblies to agitate the masses , so that they would pay the tax and buy large numbers of bonds of their own accord ; and when doubts arose among the masses we did not give them detailed explanations , but rather resorted to compelling the rich peasants and capitalists , and then extended it to the worker @-@ peasant masses .
This brought about a grave situation of being divorced from the masses , and it actually increased the difficulties of collecting the land tax and issuing the bonds .
This in turn affected all other aspects of the mobilization work .
This is a grave problem indeed .
In this practice of coercing people and ordering them around has not only appeared in the emergency mobilization but is also common in all types of work in the Soviets .
This kind of work style has been fostered by the fact that the various leadership organs have , in their leadership , fallen into a grave kind of bureaucratism , and in their acceptance and implementation of orders from their superiors , they either pass them along routinely or even unopened , and do not call a meeting to discuss concrete methods of implementing them in accordance with the local situation , so as to direct their subordinates &apos; work .
As to the results of their implementation , they never investigate them or ask how they have turned out , but simply try to let things drift .
All of their execution of orders depends simply upon
giving orders , and all work at all times is simply done routinely with the holding of routine meetings .
This is out @-@ and @-@ out bureaucratism .
Bureaucratism alienates the masses and destroys the connection between the Soviets and the masses .
It does the greatest harm to the cause of the Soviet &apos;s victory and progress .
Doing work in a perfunctory way , using coercion and commands , is an important expression of bureaucratism , and it absolutely must not be allowed to exist in the Soviet government .
Such bureaucratism has crept into the Soviet governments :
By infection of China &apos;s semi @-@ feudal society and Kuomintang bureaucratism .
_ _
Because the peasants are trapped in disorganization and lack the organization and discipline of the proletariat .
Because there is a lack of the spirit of hard struggle and people simply try to devise short @-@ term solutions so that bureaucratism creeps into the Soviet organs and expands daily .
The People &apos;s Committee calls upon Soviet organs at all levels and the broad masses of workers and peasants to wage a determined struggle in common against bureaucratism and to expunge it from the Soviet organs , driving out all incorrigible decadent bureaucratic elements so as to consolidate the power of the worker @-@ peasant Soviets and also create a new work style in the Soviets .
To this end , they must :
Build in all their work upon mobilization of the masses , for anyone who neglects mass mobilization work becomes divorced from the masses .
In carrying out decrees and resolutions , do not simply resort to commands , but rely heavily upon a raising of the masses &apos; class consciousness and enthusiasm to support the carrying out of decrees .
In mobilizing the masses , make use of thorough political propaganda and agitation work .
In mobilizing the masses , utilize all organizations in the Soviets and all mass groups to mobilize the masses ; the urban and rural representative assemblies and mass meetings of the electorate are tools for direct mobilization of the masses , and the labor unions are the cornerstone of mass mobilization .
In carrying out every decision , adhere to practical possibilities , opposing every impractical and non @-@ concrete resolution as well as all unprepared and fruitless routine meetings .
In carrying out orders , give full attention to the methods of mobilizing the masses and also to the opinions of the masses as reference material in determining methods of carrying them out . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ... _ _ .
.. _ _ _
When receiving an order or a resolution from superiors , immediately hold a meeting and conduct a detailed discussion to determine the concrete methods for carrying it out .
In carrying out orders , constantly investigate the work to see whether
it is successful or not and see whether there are any errors or unsound parts ,
In all work , divide up labor in a way consonant with the conditions of the work , not only among the departments and the working comrades , but also in directing subordinates . _ _ _ _ _ _
In directing subordinates , be practical and concrete and issue workable instructions liberally .
Refrain from constantly issuing documents , but make inspection tours and give guidance .
These tours should not be junkets , and they should not stand on the sidelines and criticize , but should responsibly investigate the work and help subordinates in resolving work difficulties .
Organize working groups to give direct assistance to the subordinates .
The responsibility of the working groups is to get the work done well where they are , not to engage in idle criticism of others and do no work themselves , The work style of the working groups should be to concentrate forces and do the work well at one place before proceeding to another .
They should divide up the labor so that each person does one part , and they should do their work well in every place they go to .
Refrain from holding disorganized meetings .
Meetings should be prepared for , should have results , and should be conducted in a practical way .
In holding mass meetings , make thorough preparations in advance .
All political agitation should conform to the demands of the masses and be connected with the masses1 own interests .
Speeches should be simple and clear and effective as agitation .
The work style of the Soviets should have a mass nature , be practical , organized , disciplined and characterized by a firm determination for bitter struggle ; all approaches divorced from the masses are bureaucratic work style ,
The People &apos;s Committee calls upon Soviet organs at all levels to mobilize urgently and oppose all erroneous understanding and slack behavior relative to the enemy &apos;s large @-@ scale assault , to eradicate bureaucratism in the Soviet organs , and to struggle to create a Soviet working style and quickly complete all work under the emergency mobilization order .
All Soviet organs , from the provincial to the township level , on .
receipt of this resolution , shall immediately hold a meeting to examine their own work and in a spirit of self @-@ criticism to expose all errors of work and shall determine concrete methods for carrying it out and shall report the results of the discussions to the Central Committee .

ON INVESTIGATION OF ELECTION MOVEMENTS AT VARIOUS LEVELS--RESOLUTION OF CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
1 December 1932
&#91; Text &#93; It is almost 2 months since the Central Government proclaimed on 20 September that the governments at the various levels should individually carry out replacement elections for the governments , in accordance with election regulations .
On investigating the results of these elections , it appears :
That not a single county has completed the elections in accordance with Directive No 16 .
That the election movements at all levels have been peaceful and the masses have not been mobilized through struggle to participate in the elections .
The election movement has been entirely separated from the urgent tasks of the current war , and either all war mobilization work has been neglected because of the election or the elections have been put off on account of the press of mobilization work .
( Wan @-@ t &apos;ai &#91; 8001 3141 &#93; , for instance , had to hold the elections after the issue of bonds . )
Election regulations were not adhered to , the electing was not done by the electorate , the designation of representatives was done perfunctorily , and alien or newly reformed elements were even selected as representatives .
( For example the Hui @-@ ch &apos;ang &#91; 2585 2490 &#93; county congress . )
At the provincial and county levels , the election movement showed signs of perfunctoriness and passivity .
On the basis of the above circumstances , this election has achieved nothing , which clearly indicates that the governments at the various levels have not understood politically that the replacement elections and the reinforcing of the local Soviet governments are a basic foundation for leading the worker @-@ peasant masses in smashing the enemy &apos;s large @-@ scale attack .
It also reveals starkly the bureaucratism in the implementation of the directive by Soviets at all levels .
The Central Executive Committee believes that reinforcing the local Soviet governments will create a powerful lever in the current effort to lead the worker @-@ peasant masses in thoroughly smashing the enemy &apos;s large @-@ scale attack .
Furthermore , if we examine the past three campaigns , there were alien elements concealed in the Soviet organs which led to countercurrents and other grave occurrences , and accordingly we have decided to carry out a strict investigation of this election movement .
In all cases which fail according to the following conditions , they will be declared invalid and new elections will have to be held . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Elections where the broad mass of the electorate has not been mobilized to hold mass electoral meetings .
When those elected have not been elected with the agreement and support of the majority of the electorate .
( As recently in several locations where a list of names has been presented or even promulgated by the higher levels and presented to the electoral meetings .
This is a form of monopolizing the proceedings which is at variance with the electoral spirit . )
When those elected are not resolute revolutionaries and active workers from among the worker @-@ peasant masses .
( Those who go AWOL , who join all kinds of activities in peacetime but are not active &#91; in wartime &#93; . )
As for the new elections and the regulations in Directive No 16 , those places which were to have held replacement elections and have not held them must immediately hold them , and this replacement election movement should in particular be made into an extensive movement of the leadership organs to mobilize the masses in order to implement the emergency war mobilization and to resolutely smash the enemy &apos;s large @-@ scale attack .
Accordingly , in the election the following work should be done :
In rural and urban elections extensive political mobilization work should be done among the masses , including :
( a ) Calling upon the masses all to actively come and participate in the election movement and set up a powerful government which can truly carry out all decrees in order to secure the thorough realization of the labor law and the land law .
( b ) Make the worker @-@ peasant masses understand that the Soviet government is their government and if bad men are elected to do the work they will not be able to consider everybody &apos;s interests .
( c ) The right to vote is a right of the workers and peasants and those who have it can obtain a great deal of power ; the right to vote has been seized from the rich peasants , landlords and capitalists , so that the landlords have received no land , the rich peasants have received bad land , the capitalists hold no positions , and accordingly everyone should not give up their power . _ _ _
The political mobilization should be begun by an announcement to the masses in every village and on every street that the labor unions and poor peasants &apos; associations and all groups should come to a meeting to discuss election questions , so that all the masses will know that a replacement election is being held in that town or township , will all understand the importance of the election ; and so that when the time comes everybody will go vote of their own accord .
Investigation of voting rights should be used to mobilize the masses to struggle against hidden rich peasants and all alien elements and participate actively in the election .
At election time , the election should not only be carried out according to the procedures defined in the detailed election regulations , by means of investigation work , particularly regarding all decrees and regarding the protection of the interests of the worker @-@ peasant masses , the masses should be mobilized to criticize the work of their past representatives and government , to oppose bureaucratism , and to seriously support those they want elected .
The election movement and the mass election meetings should be used to report on and discuss the Center &apos;s emergency mobilization order , to stimulate mass activism , and to carry on the war mobilization .
As regards &#91; 23 characters deleted &#93; , the masses should be led to an understanding that the enemy &apos;s large @-@ scale attack is to oppose the Soviets and to recover the landlords &apos; and capitalists &apos; power to oppress the workers and peasants ; the political consciousness of the masses and their determination to struggle against the enemy should be raised , so that they will resolutely struggle to the end to preserve the interests of the land revolution and support Soviet power .
The holding of congresses at the district and county levels should be based on a successful carrying out of urban and rural electoral movements , and in the district and county congresses all formalism should be stamped out , and investigation of past work and discussing the carrying out of the emergency war mobilization and of all decrees should be made part of the meeting .
The items for resolution should not be long , but should be practical and concrete .
The election of committees should not be carried out in a haphazard way .
Many workers , farm laborers and toilers , and women and poor and middle peasant cadres should be elected .
Furthermore , a purely formal treatment of class membership should be corrected , and no attention should be given to the further consideration of work capacity or mass beliefs in the matter &gt; of class membership .
9 , After the district and county elections , strict investigation should be made of class memberships and occupation of all other working personnel .
Alien and shiftless elements should immediately be replaced .
The Center enjoins the province and county governments to carry out the above resolutions strictly .
All inspection , personnel and work groups have the responsibility for investigating all local election movements ; they should treat the election movement and the reinforcement of local Soviets as an inseparable aspect of the emergency mobilization order .

27 December 1932
&#91; Text &#93; We are now in the tense period in which the imperialist Kuomintang is mounting large @-@ scale attaks on the Central Soviet , and we must naturally take extra care concerning people departing from the Soviet .
They must be subjected to close examination and not allowed to leave the area at will .
This is to prevent oppressive gentry , landlords and all counterrevolutionary elements from departing freely from the area and engaging in counterrevolutionary activities .
In order to consolidate the Soviets and protect the interests of the worker @-@ peasant masses , the Provisional Central Government has laid down regulations for people departing from the Soviet areas as follows :
All persons departing from the Soviet areas must have an exit visa from the State Political Security Office and a travel pass from the government before they are allowed to go .
If they have only the visa and not the travel pass , or especially if they have only the travel pass and not the visa , they shall not be allowed to go .
The State Political Security Office and its provincial and county branches ( the district special sepresentatives have no power to issue visas ) must subject all persons requesting to depart to close examination , and only those who are determined to have a need to go outside the area may be issued exit visas .
The route by which they are to depart must be specified on the visa .
Provincial , county and district governments ( the township governments have no power to issue travel passes ) should issue travel passes to leave the area to people with only State Political Security Office visas who request them only in accordance with the route specified on the visa , and not otherwise .
The district governments in particular , when drawing up exit passes , must investigate thoroughly to assure that the persons are really transients or departing persons from that district whose route must pass through that district , and are not people who have purposely fled to.that district from other districts to obtain travel passes , before they issue them .
All local governments , security offices at all levels , all military organs and all investigative organs are charged

ON STARTING SPRING PLANTING EARLY IN ORDER TO CONCENTRATE FORCES TO SMASH ENEMY LARGE @-@ SCALE ATTACKS--DIRECTIVE NO 18 OF CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
28 December 1932
&#91; Text &#93; The revolutionary war has reached an extremely tense crisis3 and the imperialist Kuomintang is mounting a large @-@ scale -attack on the Central Soviet with all its strength .
Because it is trying to save its moribund rule , this bitter class struggle is now undergoing a sharp development .
This campaign is a do @-@ or @-@ die struggle for the enemy , much more violent than the first , second or third campaign , and in order to thoroughly smash the enemy &apos;s attack and win an even greater victory we must mobilize the broad masses of workers and peasants
and use all our strength to wage a resolute , bitter , protracted struggle against the enemy .
However , spring planting is not far off , and the spring planting period is likely to the most intense period of the war .
Accordingly , in order to allow the broad masses of workers and peasants to do their planting safely and to quickly finish their spring planting work and concentrate all their forces without any distracting concerns to destroy the enemy attacks , the Central Government has determined that within all the Soviet areas .all spring planting shall be begun early .
Measures should be taken to increase production and speed up the work as much as possible , since we expect in a short time to greatly increase the food harvest in the Soviet areas , in order to secure the provisioning of the Red Army , improve the daily life of the worker @-@ peasant masses , and guarantee the complete victory of the revolutionary war .
Accordingly this decision is of especially great importance , and governments at all levels must work with all mass organizations , such as the Rural Laborers &apos; Unions , the Poor Peasants &apos; Associations to make the greatest efforts at mobilizing all the masses to fully implement the following measures :
In January all land must be plowed and all dikes repaired .
Sowing and setting of rice seedlings must be done one month earlier than last year .
Each family must ready enough fertilizer and select its best seeds , so that it will not only be able to greatly increase production but can facilitate rapid sowing and setting of rice seedlings
The masses everywhere must institute mutual aid in planting , and assist .
each other with labor , seeds , draft animals and tools , so as to quickly carry out the spring planting work .
The masses must be mobilized to plant the Red Army &apos;s public fields and the land belonging to Red Army families at the earliest possible moment .
Not an inch must be left unattended .
Governments at all levels must devise more concrete methods of convening the Rural Laborers &apos; Unions , Poor Peasants1 Associations and electoral mass meetings for extensive propaganda and agitation , setting up revolutionary emulation and offering prized according to their specific situations .
The hsiangs and persons whose land is plowed first , and whose dikes are repaired first , whose fertilizer and seeds are readied first , who complete their sowing and setting of seedlings first , shall be awarded prizes by the county district governments .
It is especially important that the localities where land determination has not been fully completed should immediately complete the distribution , to avoid hindering spring planting .
It is so ordered .

DECLARATION OF THE REVOLUTIONARY MILITARY COMMISSION OF THE WORKER @-@ PEASANT RED ARMY OF THE PROVISIONAL CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
17 January 1933
&#91; Text &#93; Masses of all China !
With the open assistance of the English and French imperialists and the League of Nations , the Japanese imperialists have begun the invasion of North China .
This is a further extension of the imperialist bandits &apos; aggression aimed at complete dismemberment and enslavement of all China .
It has resulted in the massacre of large numbers of peaceful inhabitants , the destruction of cities and villages , and an increase in suffering and famine .
The tragedy of Shanghai and Manchuria is being repeated with extreme cruelty on a large part of China &apos;s soil .
Because of failure to resist and surrender on the part of the Kuomintang warlords Chiang Kai @-@ shek and Chang Hsueh @-@ liang , because of their repression , dispersion and massacre of soldiers resisting the Japanese , large numbers of Chinese soldiers have died under the guns of the imperialists .
The Kuomintang warlords have assisted the Japanese and the other imperialists in their further aggression and their massacres , while using all their strength to suppress the anti @-@ imperialist struggle , the goods boycott and the organized armed militia .
The Kuomintang government and its politicians offer as one explanation of their evil deeds and treasonous collaboration the idea that the existence of the Chinese Soviets makes them unable to mobilize all their forces for national defense , so that Chiang Kai @-@ shek is unwilling to fight the Japanese warlords while he uses an army of almost a million men to attack the Chinese workers and peasants who have already set up their soviet government .
But the Chinese masses want to defend themselves , and many units and many hundreds of thousands of Kuomintang troops have opposed the massacre of their own brothers and sisters and supported armed resistance to Japanese imperialism .
L
They are beginning to understand that only a national revolutionary struggle of the armed masses can victoriously resist the aggression of the Japanese imperialists .
The Chinese soviet government and the revolutionary military committee denounce the Kuomintang &apos;s explanation as a stupid lie by which they hope to conceal their treasonous activities from China &apos;s masses .
The Chinese Soviet Government and the revolutionary , military committee once more remind the Chinese masses that last April we called upon China &apos;s masses to wage an armed struggle in common with us against Japanese imperialism , and that Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s response to this call was to mobilize all his troops to attack the Chinese worker @-@ peasant government and the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army rather than to attack Japanese imperialism .
The Chinese soviet government and the Worker and Peasant Red Army military commission declare before the Chinese masses that the Chinese Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army is prepared to conclude a wartime agreement with any armed unit to oppose the invasion of the Japanese imperialists under the following conditions .
That it immediately stop attacking the Chinese soviet areas .
That it immediately guarantee the democratic rights of the masses ( those of assembly , association , speech , strike and publication ) .
That it immediately arm the masses and form armed militia to protect China and win Chinese independence , unification and territorial integrity .
We request that the Chinese masses and soldiers support this call and wage a united national revolutionary struggle to gain China &apos;s independence , unity and territorial integrity , .coordinate the struggle against Japan and all imperialists with the struggle against the treason and surrender of the imperialists &apos; running dogs the KMT warlords , and extend the armed national revolutionary struggle against Japan and all imperialists .

ON THE LENDING OF GRAIN TO THE RED ARMY BY THE REVOLUTIONARY MASSES Directive No 20 of the Central Executive Committee 1 March 1933
&#91; Text &#93; From government reports from many localities in the two provinces of Kiangsi and Fukien and numerous requests from revolutionary groups everywhere , the Central Government has concluded that the imperialist KMT is now conducting large @-@ scale attacks and engaging in large @-@ scale burning , slaughter , and pillage against the masses in the soviet areas .
Lung @-@ yen county in Fukien has been totally devastated , with incalculable losses to the masses .
.Hsi @-@ nan District in Yung @-@ ting has lost more than 20,000 tan of grain taken away by the White armies .
In Kiangsi , during the last 3 campaigns , the White troops killed several thousand people , burned tens of thousands of houses and pillaged tens of thousands of tan of grain and several tens of thousands of head of livestock .
At present , several hundred thousand White troops under Chiang Kai @-@ shek and Ch &apos;en Chi @-@ t &apos;ang have begun to storm into the soviet areas , burning , massacring and plundering .
Our heroic Red Army is now engaged in bitter combat with the White troops everywhere , but it is short on .grain and only if the revolutionary masses everywhere are willing to undertake to limit their grain consumption and lend grain to the Red Army so as to completely destroy the vicious White armies and thoroughly smash the imperialist KMT * s large @-@ scale attack , can we prevent the masses in the soviet areas from being crushed .
On the basis of the above @-@ mentioned opinion of the masses , the Central Government has decided to accept this request of the masses , and it has determined that the revolutionary masses shall of their own accord lend grain in the following manner :
Grain is something that every peasant household has , so lending grain is much easier than lending money , especially when the masses are resisting the brutality of the White armies and revolutionary fervor is at a high pitch .
The governments of all localities should work together with all the mass organizations to carry out this movement , and.within 3 months each county must complete the lending of grain by the masses , because during this time the warfare will become much more intense .
The carrying out of this grain lending movement must be based on excellent agitation and propaganda work .
The phrasing of the propaganda must be highly colloquial and every method must be used , such as performing new plays , making speeches in costume , putting up slogans , and issuing illustrated flyers , etc , , to make all those masses who have not yet requested to lend grain understand , and so that it will become a large @-@ scale spontaneous movement of all the masses to lend grain .
As to those masses who have not yet spontaneously made their request , it is absolutely forbidden to subject them to such command @-@ ist methods as forced @-@ loan confrontations instead of propagandizing them .
If forced @-@ loan confrontation methods are used not only will the Soviet government become divorced from the masses , but less grain will surely be obtained than if propaganda were used .
Allocation of quotas for grain lending must be determined in accordance with each locality &apos;s actual situation and the capacity of the masses to lend grain .
It cannot be a uniform quota throughout .
In the old soviet areas , quotas should be allocated on the basis of rice production , with rich producing areas lending more , and comparatively smaller producing areas lending less .
In the new soviet areas , account should be taken of the masses &apos; understanding of the revolution and whether or not struggle has penetrated deeply .
The areas where the struggle has gone deep should lend more than those where it has not .
As to border areas , determination should be made on the basis of whether or not they have been subject to counterrevolutionary devastation and plunder .
Those areas that have been severely devastated need not lend ; those who have suffered less should lend a suitable amount according to their circumstances .
Only in this way can we make the masses understand that lending grain to the government truly serves to protect their own interests , make them eagerly give it , and avoid the occurrence of difficulties and bad influences in doing the work .
On receipt of this directive , governments at all levels must ijmnediately and in accordance with the methods outlined summon the chairmen of all townships to a joint meeting to plan allocation of quotas and must send persons to all districts and townships to hold congresses and meetings of poor peasants associations , agricultural laborers associations and the electorate , and to propagandize and explain to the people of those localities the eagerness of the masses elsewhere to lend grain and their methods of doing it , as well as organizing emulation so that everyone will lend grain eagerly .
The grain that is lent shall be handled as follows in the various areas : a .
In Kiangsi
Po @-@ sheng , Shih @-@ chTeng , Yu @-@ tu , hui @-@ ch &apos;ang , Jui @-@ chin , Sheng @-@ li and Hsing @-@ kuo counties and southern Yun @-@ feng shall all collect it at the district government headquarters , and apart from a portion that shall be given to the local hospital , government , &#91; army &#93; units and other state organs for their expenses , the rest should be saved and handled according to future orders of the central government .
Kung @-@ lueh , Wan @-@ t &apos;aij and northern Yung @-@ feng , Kan @-@ hsien , I @-@ huanga Lo @-@ an Nan @-@ kuang , An @-@ yuan , Hsun @-@ wu : apart from a portion which shall be taken out for the operating expenses of the local Red Army ( paid for by the government ) government hospitals and various organs by the county governments after discussion of their needs and for assistance to the mass organizations , the remainder may be sold at current market price .
In Fukien
In Ch &apos;ang @-@ t &apos;ing and Ning @-@ hua it shall be collected at the district government headquarters and kept to be disposed of in accordance with future orders of the central government ; but in Shang @-@ hang Hsin @-@ chfuan and Wu @-@ p &apos;ing some shall be used to provision the local Red Army and government organs and subsidize the mass organizations ( given out according to price ) and the rest sold at the going price .
Proceeds from all grain sold at an estimated price must be handed over to the treasury branch and a 5 @-@ copy receipt obtained from the treasury branch as proof .
No government at any level may appropriate the slightest amount , and if there is any unauthorized use of these funds or if the price of the sale is reported as lower than it actually was , those guilty of corruption and misconduct will be dealt with severely .
All local governments , hospitals and units and revolutionary mass organizations which eat rice shall sell off these grains as quickly as possible , but they must do it for cash and not on credit .
After the financial units at all levels have received grain borrowing receipts from the central government financial department , they must set up special grain borrowing accounts showing item by item the amount of grain received from the masses , number of grain receipts issued to the masses , amounts of grain issued to various organs , and amount of grain sold and the price , in order to aid in keeping correct accounts .
Money from the grain sales handed over to the branch departments shall be put by the treasury branches into a separate account named the &quot; Masses &apos; Grain Lending Account &quot; and must not be mixed in with special income or the Red Army &apos;s public grain account .
All masses who lend grain shall receive a grain lending receipt issued by the central government &apos;s Financial People &apos;s Committee as proof .
Anyone who receives a grain lending receipt shall be allowed in the second half of 1933 to submit it as part of his land tax .
Those which are obtained after the tax or are left over after paying the tax shall be redeemed for cash by the district government leadership at the proper time .
The grain loan receipts must bear the seal of the township soviet chairman and may only be used to pay taxes in that district .
Those that do not bear this seal or are not from the district in question shall be considered as void extra receipts .
The receipts shall be distributed by the county government departments in accordance with the situation of the masses and the grain in each district .
The districts in turn shall allocate them after discussion of the situations of the various townships .
The government leadership at every level shall keep a record of all receipts issued , and if they hold receipts for which grain has not been handed in these must be handed over ; there cannot be any discrepancies .
When the masses lend their grain they shall be given receipts in return , and anyone who lends grain and does not receive one may complain to the higher level governments and request strict enforcement .
The grain from the &quot; three sheng of rice &quot; .movement collected in the various , localities since January of this year may be included in the amount of grain lent , and receipts must be issued for it .
If rich peasants have had to make forced contributions they shall not be made to lend grain .

OPPOSE JAPANESE IMPERIALISTS1 OCCUPATION OF JEHOL AND ATTACK ON PEKING AND TIENTSIN
Proclamation of Provisional Central Government
3 March 1933
&#91; Text &#93; To the masses of all China !
The 75mm artillery and great numbers of fighters and bombers of the Japanese imperialists are now carrying out inhumane bombardment massacres in the Jehol area !
Eight Japanese imperialist divisions and two brigades , with the support of several hundred aircraft , are now attacking Chfeng @-@ te from three directions !
The KMT generals continue to follow their shameless policy of non @-@ resistance and retreat step by step , giving up K &apos;ai @-@ lu , Pei @-@ p &apos;iao and Ch &apos;ao @-@ yang , and have abandoned hundreds of thousands of peaceful inhabitants and anti @-@ Japanese soldiers to be trodden under the iron hoofs of Japanese imperialism , crushed and massacred !
Masses of all ChinaJ More than half of Jehol has already fallen into the hands of the Japanese imperialists , and all of North China is at a life @-@ or @-@ death crisis , and the tragic fate of colonial slavery directly threatens the toiling masses of all China !
Masses of all China !
The imperialists &apos; bandit war to invade and enslave all of China is now being frenziedly waged , and only one road lies before us : to arm ourselves and wage a revolutionary national liberation war .
Only the armed strength of the millions of the masses can defeat the bandit war of the Japanese and all imperialists to invade and enslave China and can gain independence , liberation and territorial integrity for the Chinese people !
The provisional Chinese soviet government has repeatedly called upon the masses of all China to arise and wage a victorious national revolutionary war together with the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army and the toiling masses of the Soviets .
In its most recent declaration it clearly declared before the masses of China that the Chinese Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army is willing to conclude a conditional wartime agreement with all true anti @-@ Japanese units .
But the KMT warlords and politicians have most shamelessly knelt before the imperialists and betrayed China , practicing non @-@ resistance
^
and surrender , have cut off the Three Eastern Provinces and sold out Shanghai and massacred anti @-@ Japanese and anti @-@ imperialist worker @-@ peasant masses and revolutionary fighters , and forbidden the organization of all goods boycotts and anti @-@ Japanese militia .
How , at the very moment when the Japanese imperialists are attacking Jehol with all their strength , they even more openly advocate abandoning Jehol and Peking and Tientsin ; they protest that this is a strategic necessity , while at the same time they attack the Chinese worker @-@ peasant masses and the worker @-@ peasant government and Red Army with dozens of divisions !
The Soviet Government declares that it is willing to draw up a wartime agreement with all truly anti @-@ Japanese armies .
The KMT response to this declaration is to retreat step by step before the iron hoofs of the Japanese imperialists , without dispatching a single soldier to Jehol to resist the Japanese , but to dispatch the greater part of its military force to Kiangsi and under the personal leadership of the counterrevolutionary chieftain Chiang Kai @-@ shek to wildly attack the soviet areas !
It is precisely because the soviet areas have called upon and organized the anti @-@ imperialist , anti @-@ Japanese movement throughout the country that the traitorous KMT government has , with increased ferocity , resorted more and more to burning , slaughter and pillage , military adventurism and economic blockade , with the aim of hindering the development of the soviet movement , in order to break the main force of anti @-@ imperialism and resistance to Japan !
The KMT warlords and politicians plan to treat the soviet government &apos;s declaration that it is willing to draw up a wartime treaty with all anti @-@ Japanese units as an expression of the Soviet government1 and Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army &apos;s weakness ; but this actually expresses their own obtuseness and stupidity .
The warfare of the last 2 days has taught these traitorous warlords a stern lesson : the 52nd and 59th divisions have been entirely disarmed , and their commanders and staff officers have all been captured , so that the 5th Army is a shambles .
The soviet movement has gained the support of millions of the masses , while the KMT warlords &apos; military adventurism and economic blockade have only served to further stir up the resistance of the toiling masses of the entire country , and in addition have created favorable conditions for the further advancement of the soviet movement !
The Chinese Soviet Government is preparing to wage war directly against the troops of the Japanese imperialists and to drive them out of China .
Accordingly , we must eliminate all reactionary armies and armed groups which hinder us in doing battle with Japan !
The Soviet Government and the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army once more declare that they are willing to enter into a wartime agreement with all truly anti @-@ Japanese military forces , but they will strike the gravest blows at all armies and armed groups which encroach upon the soviet areas , to the point of completely destroying them !
We call upon our brothers among the fighters of the White armies !
Rise and oppose your treasonous officers , turn the guns around , join up with the Red Army to oppose the bandit invasion of the Japanese imperialists and drive them out of China !
Masses of all China !
Our brother fighters in the White armies !
The Provisional Soviet Central Government calls upon you to arise and wage an armed national revolutionary war , to oppose Japanese imperialism and the traitorous KMT rule !
Oppose the attacks on the Chinese Worker @-@ Peasant 8.ed Army and soviet areas !
Support our call to struggle and oppose your traitorous officers , arise oil your own account and link up with the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army to oppose Japanese imperialism1s bandit invasion !
Oppose the attacking of the Soviet areas with even a single soldier , a single rifle , a single shell !
Demand that all the military force of the entire country be dispatched to North China to oppose the attack of Japanese imperialism !
Spread the national revolutionary war and opposition to Japan and all imperialism , and overthrow the imperialists &apos; running dogs , the KMT !

OK THE MATTER .
OF GRAIN REDISTRIBUTION AMONG THE PEOPLE TO KEEP UP THE PROVISIONING OF TEE ARMED FORCES
Order No 39 Of the People &apos;s Committee of the Provisional Central Government 4 March 1933
&#91; Text &#93; According to reports from various localities in various counties .
in the soviet areas , a good many localities have recently forbidden the transport of cereals and rice , and county A and county B have drawn a boundary line between them ; in many localities there has been a grain famine , and prices have soared or grain cannot be bought at any price .
This is an extremely grave circumstance .
Investigation indicates that in the soviet areas the food situation is uneven , with surpluses in some areas and shortages in others .
In the border areas , where the enemy are plundering and pillaging , there are rice famines .
In the areas where the Red Army is stationed and near hospitals food is even more in shortage .
Readjustment between the districts and the counties affects not only the daily food of the ordinary masses , but is an extremely critical matter affecting the provisioning of the Red Army and its hospitals and rear area .
It is therefore an absolutely indispensible condition for the smashing of the enemy &apos;s fourth attack and accordingly is extremely critical .
The reasons that grain circulation has been hindered boil down to three :
The masses who are short on food are afraid tha.t much will flow out of their area , and in May and June they will have to eat high @-@ priced rice .
Those who have excess food wish to keep it for later , so as to get high prices .
Rich peasants and traitorous merchants are manipulating and trying to get profits , or even intentionally making trouble in order to subvert the revolutionary war , and the governments of the various areas are not investigating them .
So as it.turns out , people are afraid that in May
and June they will be eating high @-@ priced rice , while in other places it has come to that much earliera and they are already eating rice at a high price .
In Tung @-@ ting you can get 3 1 / 2 sheng for a yuan , whereas in Shang @-@ hang you can get 4 sheng for a yuan , in T &apos;ing @-@ chou 7 sheng , and in Jui @-@ chin it is as high as 8 , but in other rice @-@ poor areas it gets more expensive day by day .
The workers in the cities have no land to farm but make a living by selling their labor3 and a whole family with young and old , with that little bit of income from their labor , eats rice that keeps getting more and more expensive .
The entire Red Army is now on the front line fighting a life @-@ and @-@ death struggle with the enemy , and relies upon the rear area to keep sending up military provisions .
The governments of all areas must explain this fact to the masses in their areas : we certainly want the whole soviet area to have food to eat , but we especially want the Red Army to have food to eat , and only by joining forces with a common purpose to smash the enemy can we move ahead .
They must tell those people who have extra grain not to .keep thinking of high prices when people in other places are suffering hunger and the front lines are short on military provisions ; people can &apos;t stand by and watch without heeding .
They must know that it is bad for everybody , and if the Red Army doesn &apos;t win , you can &apos;t achieve your own aims .
As to the rich peasants and merchants , they were unhappy when the government collected military provisions and when the cooperatives redistributed the people &apos;s food , and they either intentionally stored it away or secretly engaged in manipulation , or even disseminated rumors on a large scale to stir up the masses .
This is counterrevolutionary activity and governments at all levels in all localities must lead the revolutionary masses in .dealing severely with these people .
They must know that the interests the whole and the interests of the war take first place among all interests .
The local governments and the masses must understand this profoundly .
The central government has decided on a plan for grain distribution and has set up a grain .distribution office .
All local governments must lead the masses to quickly organize food cooperatives , and with the leadership and assistance of the food redistribution offices they must strive to carry out the redistribution .
In addition to rice , they must ration salt in order to prevent the rich peasants and traitorous merchants from storing it away and manipulating the market , in order to guard against the KMT &apos;s grave economic blockade , to regulate the people &apos;s food in all areas , and to continue the provisioning of the front line .
All local governments must know that the central Soviet &apos;s harvests were not rich last year , and this year &apos;s spring famine problems will inevitably be more serious .
Leading the masses to resolve this grave problem is a major task for the soviet governments ; from the provincial @-@ KLevel Soviets down to the urban and rural representative assemblies , all must conduct detailed discussions , plan meticulously , propagandize broadly and carry it out with great effort if we are to complete this task .
This is an extremely pressing question for the masses .
It is the main key to smashing the enemy &apos;s fourth encirclement campaign .
In order to make the Soviet Government into a government which truly represents the masses1 interests
and which powerfully Leads the war , ve must avoid the slightest neglect of this problem .
The Central Government &apos;s Ministry of Interior shall not only issue this report , but shall notify all local governments at all levels to earnestly implement it .
It is so ordered .

153ON THE QUESTION OF SUPPRESSING INTERNAL COUNTERREVOLUTION
Directive No 21 of the Central Executive Committee of the Provisional Central Government
15 March 1933
&#91; Text &#93; At a time when the imperialist KMT warlords have carried out four encirclement campaigns against the soviet areas throughout the country and are now carrying out a large @-@ scale attack against the Central Soviet area , and when the struggle &quot; between revolution and counterrevolution has arrived at the point of life @-@ and @-@ death .
struggle , the enemy is not only applying military force but is also organizing counterrevolutionary activities in the soviet areas in a planned way , using the landlords , rich peasants and merchants in the soviet areas to organize all sorts of counterrevolutionary groups ( the AB Group , the Social Democratic Party , the Trotskyite Party and feudal superstitious groups like the I @-@ hsin Hui &#91; 0001 1800 2585 &#93; and Lan @-@ tzu Hui &#91; 2036 1311 2585 &#93; ) , deceiving a minority of backward masses , seizing opportunities to stir up trouble , and at the same time sending scouts to penetrate the Soviet areas to ferret out military intelligence .
On the basis of recently discovered facts , such as the people who shouted counterrevolutionary slogans at the mass meeting in T &apos;ing @-@ chou and the smashing and capture of a KMT county party branch organ in Tfing @-@ chou , the discovery of similar reactionary posters in the three localities of Jui @-@ chin , T &apos;ing @-@ chou and Ho &apos;tHen , the secreting away of four rifles in the household of the Shih @-@ chTeng propaganda department chief , the organization by the enemy of anti @-@ revolutionary activities in Nan @-@ kuang &#91; 0589 1639J county which hindered all mass work and wartime mobilization work , the plans of traitorous merchants in the Hui @-@ ch &apos;ang area to carry on activities to subvert the soviet currency , the planned money conversion by traitorous merchants in Jui @-@ chin and T &apos;ing @-@ chou , the manipulation of commodity prices everywhere &apos;by traitorous merchants , along with large @-@ scale transfer of cash , and even the discovery of counterrevolutionary subversive actions in certain of the local armed organizations , all of these recently discovered facts prove clearly that the enemy is organizing counterrevolution in the soviet areas , and politically and economically and in all ways he is carrying out pernicious plans to destroy the Soviet and the revolution .
But our soviet governments in all areas are completely lacking in vigilance and still are paying insufficient attention to this grave counterrevolutionary activity , and are even permitting it .
The central government is now gravely calling it to the attention of governments and their organs for suppressing counterrevolutionaries at all levels that this past attitude of paying no attention to and permitting counterrevolutionary activities is totally impermissible , all governments and their organs for purging counterrevolutionaries must immediately rectify these errors and must immediately take steps to deal with counterrevolution in accordance with the actual situation in their localities .
In the districts and townships and in particular in all the cities , whenever lurking counterrevolutionary elements or their activities are encountered , resolute and rapid measures must be taken to repress them severely , and when the situation is pressing they must proclaim a temporary state of martial law and the soviet governments and all revolutionary organs must institute an armed and mass @-@ style defense .
In order to sternly put down counterrevolution , important counterrevolutionary elements must rapidly and unhesitatingly be apprehended and punished and the nature of their crimes must be broadly propagandized among the local masses .
Governments in all localities and at all levels and especially the urban and district and township governments , must propagandize the fact of the coordination of counterrevolution activities within the soviet areas with the White armies outside , and mobilize all the revolutionary masses to carry out the most stringent oversight and surveillance over merchants , rich peasants and landlord elements and to seek in all quarters for clues of counterrevolutionary , organization and activity .
The soviet government organs for suppressing counterrevolution must set up close relationships with the labor unions , agricultural laborers &apos; associations , poor peasant associations and other revolutionary groups , because only if the broad masses under the leadership of the government .set to work enthusiastically can counterrevolutionary organizations and activities be thoroughly extirpated .
The judicial departments in all counties in the border areas must quickly deal with all criminals already apprehended ; and all elements whose crimes have been clearly proven , starting with ; the alien class elements among them , must immediately be put to death .
The death sentences need not be carried out according to.Article 26 of the Judicial Department &apos;s Temporary Regulations on Organization and Judicial Activities , which requires permission from the higher levels ; the death sentences may be carried out first and the cases reported to superiors afterward .
As to the central districts , accumulated cases must also be quickly dispatched and must not be allowed to pile up again , nor must there be .
any delay of the speedy suppression of counterrevolutionaries .
In the central areas , In times of particular distress death sentences .may also.be carried out and the superior authorities informed afterwards .
This is a measure which it is necessary for us to take while the enemy are carrying out large @-@ scale attacks , and it cannot be regularly adopted in ordinary times .
Landlords and rich peasants in areas under attack by the enemy and border areas must be dealt with separately .
When they have actually engaged in
counterrevolutionary activities , they &quot; must immediately be apprehended and severely punished , and not given leeway for the slightest bit of activity .
As to the other landlord and rich peasant elements about which nothing counterrevolutionary has been discovered , the government in the locale must stir up the masses to keep strict surveillance on their activities .
They should not all be apprehended , except if they exercise an unwholesome influence or if it makes dealing with them later more difficult .
The central government confidently believes that in this attack of internal and external counterrevolution on the revolution , we possess the conditions to entirely smash them and win an all @-@ round victory .
We have the broad masses of the people and the powerful Red Army , we have strong and consolidated government organs and we must use these powerful government organs ( central and local ) to lead the millions of worker @-@ peasant masses and the Red Army to strike mortal blows against our internal and external enemies .
We have the precious experience of the past purges of counterrevolutionaries and we must use these experiences to subject counterrevolutionary elements within the soviet areas to stern repression and thorough extirpation .
Governments at all levels upon receiving this directive must immediately and in the light of the concrete situation in their locality decide upon the methods of implementing it , and must report on methods of implementation through channels .
It is so ordered .

N MOBILIZING THE MASSES TO HELP GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL IN THEIR FARMING WORK SO TO RELIEVE THE FAMILY DISTRESS OF GOVERNMENT WORK PERSONNEL AND INCREASE GOVERNMENT WORK EFFICIENCY
Order No 18 of the Central Executive Committee , Provisional Central Government
14 April 1933
&#91; Text &#93; In the current period of bitter struggle in the civil war , the workers of the Soviet Government have been unable to pay out wages according to individual labor , so that people &apos;s families have no economic assistance .
This spirit of bitter sacrifice on the part of workers in the Soviet Government deserves praise .
The situation everywhere tells us that there are many poverty @-@ stricken workers @-@ peasant elements who are active and have work ability but since they are the main workers in their families &apos; production and have been bound by family labor and cannot come to work in the government , so that the governments in some areas lack such good work personnel and have chosen some not very active people , who are lacking in work ability4 for government work .
The reason is that only these people are not the main laborers in family production and are not bound by the family labor , and accordingly they have been selected for government work .
In this way , the standard for selecting personnel has departed from revolutionary activism and work ability and only depends on the family being at leisure , , a circumstance which is impermissible .
There is another , even wore impermissible circumstance ; in some localities at election time the good elements , because of the press of their family livelihood , are unwilling to be elected , and so bad elements come out , rich peasants and vagabonds , and thus bore into the soviet organs .
This is going on in some localities .
As .
to people from good class origins , active in the revolution and capable in.their work &gt; they have taken on government work , but because of family labor problems , which are unresolvable they cannot work with an easy mind , a situation which is extremely widespread ( particularly at the district and township levels ) .
rhe central executive committee , on the basis of the above circumstances3 and in order to make the soviet government into an active and able government , able to lead the broad masses of the people , under circumstances of bitter struggle , to win a revolutionary victory , has resolved :
For all workers in the soviet governments at all levels , who want to participate but whose families truly have no labor force or not enough , after it is so determined , the local government must mobilize the masses to do their families &apos; farming for them or help their families do it , ( families whose labor force is sufficient are excluded ) , to the extent that their family livelihood will not fall short of what it would be if they themselves were present and working .
For a concrete method , Point 4 of the Red Army &quot; Good Treatment &quot; points may be used ( &quot; For those with no labor force , people shall be sent to help with all planting , irrigation , and harvesting work ; for those with insufficient labor force , supplemental assistance according to their needs shall be given . &quot; ) - These people &apos;s domestic worries should be alleviated so that they can do their government work with their minds at ease .
The use of this aid measure is aimed at bringing large numbers of the people with good class background , revolutionary activism and good work ability into the soviet governments at all levels and strengthening the governments &apos; work abilities .
This is made known with the expectation that governments at all levels will comply and implement it .
It is so ordered .

PROCLAMATION OF THE PROVISIONAL CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND THE MILITARY AFFAIRS COMMISSION OF THE WORKER @-@ PEASANT RED ARMY
15 April 1933
&#91; Text &#93; Masses of all China !
On 1 May we shall solemnly convey our revolutionary greetings to the toiling masses of all China , to the workers and peasants and urban poor groaning under the blood @-@ stained leadership of the KMT , to the fighters who were oppressed into opposing the Chinese workers and peasants , to the revolutionary students and youth participating in the anti @-@ imperialist struggle , and to the hundreds and thousands of revolutionary prisoners incarcerated and oppressed in KMT prisons !
The continuing attacks of Japanese imperialism , the unprecedented buildup of a crisis threatening the total dismemberment of China , and the profundity of the crisis of the whole people impels us to make a further declaration to all people fighting for the interests of China and to the toiling masses .
The characteristic of the present situation is the totally unchecked rush of the Japanese imperialists into Peking and Hankow .
At the same time the British imperialists are attacking in Sinkiang and are preparing , through their puppets in Tibet and elsewhere , to occupy western China .
In the secret talks now being held by the Japanese and the KMT , Chiang Kai @-@ shek has made yet another deal with the imperialist bandits .
The secretariat of the Central Political Committee of the KMT , with powers to represent the Nanking government and Chiang Kai ^ shek , are holding secret talks with the Japanese representative Yoshizawa in Shanghai .
Chiang Kai @-@ shekT.-the executioner of the Chinese workers and peasants and the chief criminal who in 1929 asked the Japanese to occupy Shantung and in 1932 secretly ; massacred the defenders of Shanghai ^ has now abandoned the northern front and is once again promoting the traitor Yang Yu ^ tin who opened the road for the Japanese invasion of Jehol .
When Chiang Kai @-@ shek went to the north , he waged no war against Japanese imperialism , but recognized the handiwork of his friend , the traitor Chang Hsuelx @-@ liang .
The southwest government and the Fukien warlords alike .have failed to oppose Japan or any other imperialists ; their recent propaganda about &quot; opposing Japan in the Korth &quot; has been nothing but falsehoods designed to deceive the masses .
They are really intent upon expanding their own lands and attacking the Soviets and the Red Army .
Why does Chiang Kai ^ shek want to return to Kiangsi ?
Why has he abandoned the northern armies , leaving them empty @-@ handed against the Japanese artillery and aircraft ?
Why have the KMT and their government concentrated large numbers of units , all their aircraft and military equipment to oppose the workers and peasants of Kiangsi ?
Because they are now bargaining with Japan and all the imperialists to make China into their private possession and betray it utterly .
Because they hope that the Japanese and the other imperialists will allow them to become puppet rulers of a few provinces , as they did in the case of &quot; Manchukuo .
&apos; * Because they want to massacre the Chinese masses in order to support imperialism and the rule of the Chinese landlord bourgeoisie .
In order to cover up their surrender and treason , the KMT have fabricated the myth that Japanese imperialism is helping the Red Army with money and ammunition , spreading the slander that the Chinese Soviet Government is holding talks with warlords .
This base and shameless rumor has already been shattered by many ironclad facts .
The Chinese Soviet Government and the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army are the only mass political power and armed force opposing all imperialist invasions , and in repeated heroic combats , the Chinese Soviet Red Army has been shown to be constant in its stance to all imperialists ; we are inseparably connected with the Japanese workers and peasants because they too are carrying on a heroic struggle in opposition to Japanese imperialism , and they too have been plundered , oppressed and massacred by the ruling class .
But the Japanese imperialists and warlords are our common enemy .
We are engaged in a struggle for the interests of the toiling masses of all China and for Chinese independence , unification and territorial integrity .
At present we must wage war against Japan and the other imperialists , and we will overthrow anyone who opposes that war .
We have complete faith that the struggle of the Chinese workers @-@ peasant fighters and the heroic defense of the Red Axmy will be able to prevent imperialism ) Chiang Kai @-@ shek and the bankrupt KMT from realizing their plan to dismember China ;
In the last 3 months the workers and peasants of Kiangsi and their Red Army have smashed more than nine enemy divisions .
In several battles they captured more than 30,000 men and weapons along with large amounts of military supplies and innumerable , weapons ..
About 10,000 troops from the KMT armies have already joined th _ e Kiangsi Red Army of their own free will .
The Red Army in Hunan , Hupeh , Honan and Szechwan have also been growing rapidly .
From the proclamations of the commander of the 52nd division and the commander and staff of the 59th Division , recently captured in Kiangsi , it can be clearly seen how profound the disintegration of the KMT army is ; they denounce the KMT and Cuiang Kai @-@ shek , express penitence for their own past crimes in opposing the Chinese workers and peasants and ask the fighters and officers of the White armies to stop their attacks on the Soviet areas , turn the guns around and attack the KMT traitors who are selling out our motherland .
In view of the recent great victories of the Red Army and the waverings of their front @-@ line troops , as well as the hatred of the masses of the entire country , the traitorous Chiang Kai @-@ shek and Wang Ching @-@ wei how hope , by means of such arbitrary propaganda as &quot; exterminating the communists is resisting the Japanese &quot; and &quot; no discussion of resisting the Japanese until the communists are wiped out &quot; to hinder the revolutionization of the broad masses of fighters and to cover up their own treason and surrender .
But such deceit and threats cannot succeed .
Quite the opposite ; they only serve to further expose their wickedness .
In view of the current situation and our victory it behooves us once again to transmit the proposal we made in January to smash the slander of the KMT regarding hindrance by the Red Army and the workers and peasants in the Soviets of an effective resistance to the Japanese .
We believe that if only we can actively oppose the invasion of the Japanese imperialists as we proposed before , it will immediately be possible , and accordingly we once again declare our proposal to the entire nation .
Under the following conditions the Chinese Red Army is prepared to conclude a wartime agreement with any armed units to oppose the Japanese imperialist attack :
That it immediately stop the attacks on the Chinese Soviet areas ;
That it immediately guarantee the democratic rights of the masses Cassembly , association , speech , publication , and demonstration , and the release of political prisoners ) ;
That it immediately arm the masses and form armed militia units to guard China and win China &apos;s independence , unification and territorial integrity .
Every worker , peasant and fighter can understand that without the above conditions a victorious war against the imperialists is impossible .
The KMT policy is bankrupt .
It is @-@ leading to the dismemberment of China and the further enslavement of China &apos;s masses , and it continues to increase the suffering , .hunger and .massacre of the masses .
We call on all workers and fighters among the broad masses of the people , in the army and .the militia ^ to intensify their work to make @-@ them accept our policy of national revolution .
We call upon all toiling masses to support us in defending China and the power of toe people .

LETTER TO RESPONSIBLE PERSONS IN SOVIETS AT ALL LEVELS ON THE SUMMER PLANTING 22 April 1933
{ Text &#93; To presidiums of the provincial county and district Soviets , heads of land departments , chairmen of township Soviets and all representatives :
The spring planting is over .
Although good results have been obtained in some places , the results have been extremely bad in others .
A grave circumstance is that the government presidiums have neglected the spring planting , the land departments have shirked it , and especially in the means of mobilization we have become divorced from the masses .
Now it is already time for summer planting , and soon it will be time for the autumn harvest ; if you fail again to make an effort and do not immediately change from your errors of the spring planting and assume a spirit of struggle to approach the summer planting , then the plan to increase harvest by 20 percent in the interest of the masses and of the revolutionary war will be most gravely affected .
Accordingly , the central land department has printed an outline of the summer planting movement ( &quot; How To Lead the Summer Planting Movement , &quot; published by Red China ) to distribute to you .
In this outline , the critical significance of the summer planting , its aimss its central tasks and the means of mobilizing the masses for it are pointed out .
In particular the concrete examples of Juir * chin and Wu @-@ yang district are singled outthere they carried out a true &quot; organized mobilization &quot; and stimulated the peasant masses to an unprecedentedly high level of labor enthusiasm , achieving great results in the spring planting .
When you receive this outline , you should immediately convene all necessary meetings Cthe chairman of the county soviet and the head of the land department should convene a meeting of district chairmen and heads of land departments , the district soviet and its land department should hold a meeting of township soviet chairmen and chairmen of poor peasant associations , the township soviets should convene meetings of their respective assemblies3 poor peasants and women &apos;s congresses , Red Guards and Young Pioneers and the youth groups and village masses ) to explain the main points of the outline and discuss the ways of carrying it out in the locality .
The summer planting struggle of the revolution should immediately be spread to all red farm villages .
The provincial soviet need not convene meetings of the county Soviets , but it should provide concrete and active leadership
on the basis of this outline .
At least once a month the province should investigate the work of its counties and the county of its districts .
The district should oversee its townships twice a month .
The central land department should during May send people to all the counties for preliminary investigation of your achievements in summer planting .
Performance of the tasks of summer planting depends primarily on your correct and energetic leadership .
Comrades , all struggle for an all @-@ around victory in summer planting !

&#91; Text &#93; To increase production in all trades in the soviet areas , to expand internal and external trade , to develop the national economy in the soviet areas and to smash the enemy &apos;s economic blockade , all of these are of the first significance amid the current acute development of the civil war .
Accordingly the central Executive Committee has published its 19th order and has added a Ministry of National Economy to the central government and National Economy Departments at the provincial and county levels .
Governments at all levels must reform their past errors of neglecting economic construction and must quickly launch the attack on the economic front .
Since the imperialist KMT carried out its fourth encirclement campaign against the Soviets and the Red Army , and at the same time carried out a cruel economic blockade , owing to the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the Soviets and the active attack of the Red Army and the masses , we have already gained an extremely great victory , but governments at all levels must understand that our war with the imperialist KMT is a protracted and bitter struggle , and even if we entirely smash the fourth encirclement campaign and win initial victories in one or several provinces , we shall still need to devote an immense amount of effort to it .
Winning a victory in economic construction , so as to improve the liveli ^ -hood of the worker ^ peasant masses , to whip up an even greater revolutionary fervor among the masses , and also to protect the needs of the Red Army in coordination with the entire war mobilization , all this has decisive significance for the victorious struggle .
Based on the above principles , governments at all levels , must grasp several central tasks of current economic construction , such as the development of industrial and agricul ^ tural production , grain redistribution , expansion of cooperatives , the setting up of an external trade office and the development of state ^ owned enterprises , and make them an actuality .
To carry on these activities , the people1s committee has determined that the National Economy Departments at all levels shall carry out a provisional organizational guideline in which is specified the setting up of the most important organs of the National Economy Department , the planning office and the investigation and
statistical office .
In addition , it is specified that before the various special administrative organsagricultural department , industrial department , communications department , internal and external trade department @-@ have been set up- , their functions shall be performed wholly or in part by the Department of National Economy .
When the governments at all levels receive this directive and guideline , they must immediately set up the various organs as specified .
Some functions that were performed formerly under he control of the finance departments such as the office of grain redistribution , the cooperatives , the external trade office , etc . , shall be relegated to the control of the Department of National Economy .
The State Printing Plant which formerly was under the control of the Department of Education is also provisionally relegated to the Department of National Economy .
The Labor Reform Institutions , which were formerly under the control of the Department of Justice and the provincial and county judicial departments , shall now have their manufacture and instruc * -tion sections relegated to the control of the Department of National Economy .
But the Communications Administration under the control of the Ministry of Interior shall only have its Transport Department relegated to the Department of National Economy , while its post , telegraphic and highway functions shall remain unchanged under its control .
The former provincial and county food departments shall be absorbed into the food section of the office of national economy .
Within the Department of ^ National Economy at the various levels , people &apos;s economy committees shall be set up as planning and reconstruction organs .
The setting up of the organs of the national economy department at : the provincial and county levels , and the duties of the personnel must quickly be reported to the central ministry of national economy .
As to the regional authorities &apos; programs for concrete leadership , these must be drawn up by an early date , and it is expected that the Ministry of National Economy will examine and approve them for execution .
It is so ordered .

ON LIMITING SPECIAL DELIVERY LETTERS Order No 8 of the People &apos;s Committee 11 May 1933
&#91; Text &#93; In order to limit special delivery letters , the People &apos;s Committee of the Interior Department of the Central Government issued an order that : &quot; Public and private letters which do not have a serious time sensitivity may not be sent special delivery . &quot; Recent investigations of certain party organs and Red units have continued to turn up many cases of frivolous use of special delivery , as the case in the 5th subdistrict where a comrade had lost a fountain pen and sent a special delivery letter to investigate , also requesting his correspondent to answer by special delivery ; and the comrade in the military department of the I @-@ huang county soviet who asked for repayment of a private debt from a comrade in the Fukien military district , also by special delivery letter .
A letter from a Ta @-@ hsi ~ pa district committee member to a Huang ^ po district committee representative asking him to send him money was also sent special delivery .
This sort of frivolous use of special delivery hinders the work of the post office , hinders the true emergency work of special delivery , and especially hinders the delivery of military intelligence , wastes public funds ; this sort of situation will not be allowed to continue .
The People &apos;s Committee once again sternly circulates its order to all organs and all units to quickly forbid these practices among their personnel and.it also lays down limitations as follows ;
Special delivery letters of military organs are limited to reporting emergency information on the enemy and delivering urgent orders and communications .
Nq other messages may he gent special delivery .
They must bear the chop of the competent commander on the letter ,
Among party departments . , governments and mass organizations , they are limited as follows ;
Hsien level organizations may send special delivery letters , but those at the district and township levels may not .
The contents of special delivery letters must be strictly time sensitive , that is , the nature of the letter must be such that if it does not arrive in an extremely short time there will be an extremely bad effect upon all types of work .
Special delivery letters shall be stamped on the outside by the party secretary for party departments , and the chairman for the governments ( department heads may do so in the central government and chairmen or committee chairmen may do so for mass organizations ) .
The Security Office shall have the responsibility for investigation , and if it discovers disobedience to the above regulations , it shall change the letter in question to an ordinary letter and in addition shall report the sender to the cognizant apparatus at the next higher level for fitting punishment .
We hope that organs at all levels and military units will strictly observe the above regulations and not again fail to adhere to them .
It is so ordered .

DECLARATION ON THE KMT SELL @-@ OUT OF PEKING AND TIENTSIN
30 May 1933
&#91; Text &#93; Masses of all China !
After Manchuria , Jehol and Shanghai were written off by the KMT Nanking Government with Chiang Kai ^ shek as its chief criminal , now Peking , Tientsin and Chahar have also been sold out by these running dogs of imperialism .
Retreat from Peking and Tientsin of all armed units and the abandoning of them to the Japanese imperialists , the preconditions for the &quot; peace talks &quot; have now been thoroughly been carried out by the KMT Nanking government .
The content of the so @-@ called &quot; peace talks &quot; is :
The Chinese armies are to retreat south of Peking @-@ Tientsin , and south of Ch &apos;ang @-@ ch &apos;eng shall be designated a buffer zone ( i.e. , a so @-@ called &quot; neutral zone &quot; ) ,
The Chinese side recognizes &quot; Manchukuo &quot; and &quot; Mengkukuo , &quot;
All militia activity and the development of all antiHtfanchukuo forces shall be stopped and the militia and all anti @-@ Japanese forces shall be disarmed at an opportune time ,
The Chinese side .undertakes to stop all anti ^ Japanese activity .
The &quot; peace talks &quot; have already succeeded .
In Peking , the representatives of Japanese imperialism , the top Chinese traitors such as Huang Ju and Ho Ying ^ k &apos;an and the British Imperialist mediator ( Lambertson ) are now celebrating their victory at a banquet .
Outside Peking , in Manchuria , Jehol , Chahar and Peking @-@ Tientsin , the Japanese imperialists are continuing to use their artillery and aircraft to bombard and massacre the anti @-@ Japanese militia , revolutionary fighters ?
and thousands upon thousands of peaceful inhabitants , in order to bring about &quot; peace and order &quot; of the colonial slaves under the rule of Japanese Imperialism .
Masses of all China !
Mongolia and Peking @-@ Tientsin have finally been sold out by the landlord bourgeoisis KMT .
This is the content of the KMT &apos;s &quot; protracted resistance , &quot; and the true nature of the KMT &apos;s &quot; resisting and negotiating at the same time . &quot; This is the KMT &apos; central government &apos;s &quot; fixed policy . &quot; The evil KMT with Ghiang Kai ^ shek as its head criminal has thus shamelessly and brazenly offered up Manchuria and Peking @-@ Tientsin with their tens of millions of square li of territory and their tens of millions of people , to Japanese imperialism .
And it is even now preparing to recompense the British imperialists for their mediation with the vast regions of Tibet , Sikang and Sinkiang !
Masses of all China !
We are the champion of the Chinese people and we will absolutely not permit the Japanese imperialists and all the other imperialists to invade a single inch of our territory ; we will not allow the imperialists &apos; running dogs the KMT to thus shamelessly and brazenly sell out China !
We shall assuredly unite , arm ourselves and expand the national revolutionary war .
With the force of the masses , 400 million strong , we will bring down imperialism and the imperialists &apos; running dogs the KMT warlords , and first among .them the KMT Nanking Government with Chiang Kai @-@ shek as its chief criminal ; only by a bloody struggle by the people of all China can we regain the land we have already lost and gain independence , liberation and territorial integrity for the Chinese people !
The Central Government and Revolutionary Military Affairs Committee of the Chinese Soviet Republic have repeatedly proposed to the armed units who are attacking the soviet areas throughout China to draw up a wartime cooperation agreement under the following three conditions in order to oppose the invasion of Japanese imperialism :
Immediately stop the attacks on the Soviet areas ;
Immediately guarantee the people1 ?
democratic rights ;
Immediately arm the masses and set up armed militia to protect China and to win China &apos;s independence , unification and territorial integrity .
But the KMT &apos;s answer to this call of the Chinese Soviet Government has been to make new surrenders and betrayals to the Japanese imperialism , to force the anti ^ Japanese fighters in the Northeast to retreat , to disarm the militia in the Northeast , and so suppress all anti ^ Japanese and anti @-@ imperialist movements of , the masses of all China , -to organize new forces to attack our soviet areas , and to send large numbers of aircraft to bomb the toiling masses and the peaceful inhabitants within @-@ the soviet areas .
Now every peasant , every worker , every fighter , every student and every revolutionary can see with his own eyes who are the traitors , who are the running dogs of imperialism !
If the KMT is not overthrown , China can only
perish , and the Chinese masses will sink Into eternal slavery to imperialism !
The Central Committee of the Chinese Soviet Republic calls upon the masses of all China , the militia in the northeast , the antI &quot; Japanese fighters in the northeast , all Chinese revolutionary students and intellectuals , independent tradesmen and all revolutionaries to join together and arm themselves , to reject all repression and massacre by imperialist police and KMT gendarmes , to struggle against Japanese imperialism &apos;s attack on China , to oppose the KMT government &apos;s sellout of China and to win liberation for the Chinese people .
The Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic is now engaged in a bloody war to completely smash the fourth encirclement campaign of imperialism and the KMT against the Soviet areas , Is setting up extensive Chinese revolutionary bases and creating an iron Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army a million strong .
It is preparing to collect its forces on the Yangtze to wage warfare directly against all Imperialists .
The Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic and its Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army have already proved to the masses of all China in a protracted anti @-@ imperialist and anti @-@ KMT war , that only it is the anti @-@ imperialist anti @-@ KMT masses1 own political power and only it can .
lead the masses of all China to overthrow Japanese imperialism and all imperialism and to overthrow the KMT government headed by Chiang Kai @-@ shek which sold out China and all traitorous KMT warlords .
Masses of all China !
Unite , arm yourselves , and together with the Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic expand the national revolutionary war and struggle to win back the lost territory in the Northeast , to defend China and to win complete liberation for the Chinese people .

CARRY OUT AN EXTENSIVE AND PROFOUND LAND INVESTIGATION MOVEMENT
Directive No 11 of People &apos;s Committee of the Provisional Central Government
1 June 1933
{ Text &#93; There are now a large number of districts in the various soviet areas and especially in the central soviet area which have not thoroughly resolved the land question .
In the central , soviet , these areas make up almost 80 percent of the area , with a population of more than 2 million , such as Jui @-@ chin ( excluding the Wu @-@ yang district ) , Hui @-@ ch &apos;ang , Hsun @-@ wua An @-@ yuan3 Hsin @-@ feng , Yu @-@ tu ( excluding Hsin Pfo district ) , Lo @-@ an , I @-@ huang , Kuang @-@ ch &apos;ang , Shih @-@ sh &apos;eng , Chien @-@ ning , Li @-@ ch &apos;uan , Ning @-@ hua , Ch ? ang @-@ tfing , and Wu @-@ p &apos;ing @-@ in all 15 entire counties .
Large parts of Po @-@ sheng , Sheng @-@ li and Yung @-@ feng and parts of Kung @-@ lueh , Wan @-@ t * al , Shang @-@ hang , Yung @-@ ting and Hsin @-@ chTuan , as well as the districts of Chun @-@ ts ? un.and Huang @-@ t &apos;ang in Hsing ~ kuo , all are places , which have not thoroughly resolved the land question .
The peasant masses in these areas have not been extensively mobilized , and the remnants of feudal power have not been finally overcome ; and in the soviet organs the mass organizations and the local armed units there are still a good many alien class elements engaging in hidden activity , and there are still a good many secret counterrevolutionary organizations in the localities engaging.in activities subversive to the revolution .
For this reason , wartime mobilization and cultural and economic construction in these areas have fallen behind those in the progressive areas ( almost all of Hsing @-@ kuo , part of Sheng @-@ li , Kan @-@ hsien , Wan @-@ t &apos;ai , Kung @-@ lueh , Yung @-@ feng and Shang @-@ hang ; Huang @-@ p &apos;o and An @-@ fu districts in Po @-@ sheng ; Hu @-@ yang district in Jui @-@ chins and Hsi ^ nan district in Yung ^ ting ) , The carrying out of a universal and profound land investigation movement in these extensive areas , the development of an extremely high level of class struggle among the more than 2 million masses , and the final assault on and thorough destruction of feudal power are tasks which in the various Soviets will not brook a moment &apos;s delay .
As for the concrete details of the carrying out of the land investigation movement , the People &apos;s Committee has determined as follows :
The governmental chairmen at the various levels are charged with using the greatest attention in leading the entire land investigation movement .
The land departments , the worker @-@ peasant investigation departments . , the judicial departments and the state political security offices and their agents at all levels are charged with devoting all their energies to directing the movement and thoroughly resolving land problems , reforming local Soviets and wiping out counterrevolution in the countryside .
The people &apos;s committees of the central land department , the worker @-@ peasant investigation department , the judicial committees , the state political security office , must devote their whole energy to directing the various subordinate organs in the thorough performance of the task .
The people &apos;s committee of the central financial department is charged with directing financial departments at various levels in attacking feudal and semi @-@ feudal power by fining landlords and exacting contributions from rich peasants , and at the same time increasing state revenues .
The central people &apos;s military committee is charged with directing the military departments at the various levels in the land investigation movement , overhauling and expanding the local armed organizations , and mobilizing the masses to serve in the Red Army .
The central people &apos;s economic committee is charged with directing the economic committees at the various levels in carrying out recovery and development of agricultural and handicraft production , the development of cooperatives and the distribution of products and commodities within the development of the land investigation movement .
The central education people &apos;s committee is charged with directing the education committees at the various levels in supplying all sorts of simple and colloquial textbooks and booklets to all cadres and masses investigating land in order to develop the land investigation movement and expanding mass cultura.1 education as the land investigation movement expands .
Governments at the provincial and county levels should summon cadres from the areas being investigated and from all progressive and relatively progressive areas to run brief land ^ investigation movement training classes .
The county Soviets should convene a meeting of the district soviet responsible persons every month and the district soviet should convene a meeting of the township soviet chairmen and poor peasant association chairmen every 10 days to investigate the experience of land investigation .
Meetings of main responsible persons in the Soviets at the district level and above in eight counties of Jui- ^ chin , Hui @-@ ch &apos;ang , Po @-@ sheng , Yu @-@ tu , Sheng @-@ li , Shih @-@ cVeng , Ning @-@ hua and Gli &apos;ang ^ tiing and meetings of poor peasant associations and .
electoral congresses in eight counties should be held at the central government to stimulate the land investigation movement in them .
In the course of the movement the class line should be persistently adhered to , taking the proletariat in the countryside as the leader and relying upon the poor peasants , resolutely uniting with the middle peasants to stage resolute attacks against feudal and semi @-@ feudal power and ferret out all landlords and rich peasants masquerading as middle peasants or poor peasants , to confiscate all land and property of the landlord class and confiscate the land and excess draft animals , farm implements and dwellings of the rich peasants , and distribute them to workers , poor and middle peasants who previously did not receive enough land or received none at all ; the rich peasants should be given relatively poor land to work .
In the land investigation movement thorough attention should be paid to mobilizing the majority of the masses to arise and struggle with the remnants of feudalism .
First , by means of extensive propaganda and agitation , a thorough investigation of people of landlord and rich @-@ peasant origin should be made , and their land and property should be confiscated .
This should be done with the agreement and participation of as large a majority as possible , and the confiscated property should all , .with the exception of money , &quot; be given out to the poorest of the masses .
Special attention should be paid to giving it out to poor Red Army dependents and a larger share of it should be given out to the masses in the villages from whence the property came .
The poor peasants association is an extremely important mass organization in the land investigation movement , and the district and township Soviets should strive to lead the poor peasants association in purging bad elements from within it and attracting large numbers of active elements to join it .
The worker team within the poor peasant association should be the active leader of the poor peasant association .
In the land investigation movement , energetic attention should be concentrated on all backward districts , townships and villages , and especially in the most backward of them .
In developing the land investigation movement in backward districts and townships and particularly in large villages attention should be paid to mobilizing the impoverished masses to arise of themselves and struggle against the landlords and rich peasants of the village .
The utmost effort should be directed toward avoiding all incorrect activity involving struggles in areas with a single lineage .
In the land investigation movement all secret counterrevolutionary organs and activities should be purged and rumor @-@ mongering and subversion by landlords and rich peasants should be prevented and exposed .
In the course of the movement the local Soviets should be reformed and all alien class elements and other bad elements should be cleaned out of them and large numbers of revolutionary activist elements should be attracted into the Soviets .
All people in the Soviets at all levels who directly or indirectly hinder the land investigation movement should receive severe or the severest punishment .
Only by persistently implementing the above decisions can we broadly and profoundly develop class struggle in the countryside and whip up the activism of the broadest range of the masses , thoroughly destroy all feudal and semi @-@ feudal power in the countryside and complete the task of the land investigation movement .
It is so ordered .

APPEAL TO THE MASSES OF JUT @-@ CHIN , HUI @-@ CH &apos;ANG , PO @-@ SHENG , AND SHIH @-@ CHTENG COUNTIES FOR 50,000 TAN OF GRAIN TO SELL TO THE RED ARMY
June 1933 -
&#91; Text &#93; ( 1 ) During the fourth revolutionary war , after Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s White army in the North suffered several tragic defeats and the Red Army won several great victories , the Kuomintang warlords are mustering their remnant troops and preparing a new attack .
Meanwhile , Kwangtung &apos;s warlord Ch &apos;en Chi @-@ t &apos;ang , Fukien &apos;s warlord Ts &apos;ai T &apos;ing @-@ k &apos;ai , and Hunan &apos;s warlord Ho Chien are starting out together and moving their troops against the soviet areas .
The Red Army is fighting bloody battles against the enemies and aiming at smashing the enemy encirclement campaign .
In another aspect , the Kuomintang conspired with Japanese imperialism to occupy Peking and Tientsin , and the Red Army is preparing to confront imperialism directly and knock down the imperialist Kuomintang at the same time .
However , in the Red Army at this time , a serious grain problem has arisen .
Some of the Red Army troops live on rice congee , and some of the Central Government organs must also have half of their meals in congee .
The price of rice is high , and it cannot be bought .
It is truly a difficult problem .
In addition , a part of the extremely impoverished masses , especially the families of Red Army soldiers , have nothing to eat .
The situation is very serious .
( 2 ) Is there no grain in the soviet areas ?
No , the soviet areas have considerable amounts of grain .
Leaving aside Kung @-@ lueh and Wan @-@ t &apos;ai , where grain is abundant , and taking , for instance , the counties of Jui @-@ chin , Hui @-@ chfang , Po @-@ sheng , and Shih @-@ chreng , we find that there is a surplus every year .
Though the harvest last year was inferior , there was still a large surplus .
Why is it that the Red Army cannot buy grain in these areas ?
Primarily , it is due to the manipulation of the rich peasants and unscrupulous merchants .
They hide the grain , or raise the price much above the market , and deliberately make it difficult for the Red Army .
Next , the people with more grain still fail to understand the difficulties of the Red Army and want to wait for higher prices in the future .
Even those who have an average amount of grain do not understand the difficulties of the Red Army ; therefore , they have not saved a part of their grain to sell to the Red Army .
With these two reasons , grain has become unavailable on
the market .
Comrades , you do not understand the difficulties of the Red Army because the Soviets of the various areas have never explained thein to you .
Now the Central Government wishes to purchase 50,000 tan of grain from the counties of Jui @-@ chin , Hui @-@ ch &apos;ang Po @-@ shehg , and Shih @-@ ch &apos;eng to supply the Red Army at the front .
It wishes to place the responsibility on the county , district , and township Soviets and the 1 million people of the four counties .
The distribution is 16,000 tan from Jui @-@ chin , 15,000 tan from Hui @-@ ch &apos;ang , 12,000 tan from Po @-@ sheng , and 10,000 tan from Shih @-@ ch &apos;eng .
However , this time it is not borrowing , but purchasing .
According to our grain borrowing experiences of the past , the masses voluntarily loaned much grain to the Red Army , and many of them even returned to us the grain borrowing notes .
It indicated the tremendous revolutionary fervor of the masses .
It indicated that the masses regarded the life of the Red Army as their own and , the moment they heard of the need , they lent their grain .
But comrades , the Red Army has exhausted the grain borrowed in the past and the Central Government now wishes to buy grain .
The amount is 50,000 tan , at market price .
It is to be delivered in batches during the month of June .
In regard to the method , those with surplus grain will surrender the surplus and an additional amount saved by them .
Those without surplus will save some grain and surrender it .
Only those who do not have enough to eat and must depend on their relatives and friends for help do not have to sell to the government .
Comrades , we all hope that the Red Army will win .
Now that the Red Army fighting on the front does not have enough to eat , can we set our mind at ease ?
We must all eat more sundry grain and vegetables and save a part of the grain to sell to the Red Army .
As many driblets become a river , we believe that it should not be hard for the million population of the four counties to save 40,000 or 50,000 tan of grain .
Comrades , as long as the Red Army on the front has enough to eat and wins battles , even if our masses in the rear eat a little less , it will be glorious and joyful !
( 3 ) Another aspect of the grain problem also requires the attention of our broad masses .
It is the problem of the grain shortage of the extremely impoverished masses .
The majority of us must not allow them , especially the families of the Red Army soldiers , to go hungry .
Their difficulty must be solved by us all .
The method of solution is mutual help among the masses , first by selling grain at reduced prices , and next by borrowing in summer and repaying in the fall .
For the interest of the class , we must not consider ourselves only and ignore the others .
Those townships with more grain must help those with less grain .
Those villages with more grain must help those with less grain .
In a village , those households with more grain must help those with less grain .
Besides selling 50,000 tan of grain to the Red Army , we must help the extremely impoverished masses .
Only thus are true class friendship and true class mutual help I
Arise , all 1 million of the masses of the four counties !
Sell 50,000 tan of grain to the Red Army I
Help the impoverished masses by &quot; price reduction &quot; and &quot; grain loans ! &quot;
Do not let the Red Army live on congeel
Do not let the impoverished masses go hungry1
Help the Red Array break down the fourth enemy encirclement campaign with grain !
Long live the victory of the Red ArmyI

OPEN CABLE NEGATING THE TREASONABLE AGREEMENT SIGNED BY KUOMINTANG 10 June 1933 &quot; J &quot; i ^ &#91; Text &#93; Revolutionary People of the Whole Nation !
On 31 May the Kuomintang government signed a North China cease @-@ fire agreement with Japanese imperialism .
By this agreement , the vast area of North China and tens of millions of people are sold to imperialism , but it is only a part of the treasonable secret treaty published by the Kuomintang .
Though Wang Ching @-@ wei and other traitorous ringleaders shamelessly claim that the agreement is only limited to military affairs and involves no politics , actually , what is even more serious is the unpublished large @-@ scale treasonable secret treaty of the Kuomintang government .
According to information obtained by this government , the contents of the secret treaty are roughly as follows : ( 1 ) The Chinese army will retreat to the south of Peking and Tientsin and the area south of the Great Wall is designated as a buffer zone .
( 2 ) China recognizes &quot; Manchukuo &quot; and &quot; the Nation of Mongolia . &quot; ( 3 ) All activities of the Volunteer Army will be stopped and the Volunteer Army and all troops resisting Japan will be disarmed according to the circumstances .
( 4 ) China guarantees the cessation of all anti @-@ Japan movements .
The Soviet Provisional Central Government , representing the people of the whole of China , absolutely refuses to recognize the secret treaty and the North China cease @-@ fire agreement , because they completely sell out the vast land of Manchuria , Mongolia , and North China and the national interest to Japanese imperialism and , doubtlessly , the Kuomintang will likewise concede to the demands of British and American imperialism , sell out the territory and rights of Tibet , Hsi @-@ k &apos;ang , and the Yangtze and Pearl river valleys , and follow its traitorous line of &quot; equal opportunity &quot; and &quot; sharing of interests . &quot; The Soviet Provisional Central Government of China appeals to the people of the entire China to rise together and resist the treasonable secret treaty and treasonable agreement of the Kuomintang and , by means of revolutionary struggles , including work strikes , school strikes ^ market strikes , mass demonstrations , and the peopled own armed forces , oppose and block the implementation of any article of the secret treaty and agreement .
The people of the entire nation must realize that , if the secret treaty and agreement are not resisted , the 400 million people will become forever the slaves of imperialism .
They must realize that only by arming themselves ,
knocking down the traitorous Kuomintang government , fighting imperialism directly , and ousting Japan and all imperialists before they can liberate themselves and avert the fate of slavery .
The Soviet Provisional Central Government declares that it is prepared to devote all its strengths , its spiritual , material , and armed strengths , to help the people of the entire nation resist Japanese imperialism and the traitorous Kuomintang , and it reiterates to all the armed units of the Kuomintang government that , under the condition of ( 1 ) immediate cessation of attacks on the soviet areas ; ( 2 ) guarantee of the people &apos;s freedoms of assembly , association , speech , and publication ; and ( 3 ) Immediate arming of the people and creation of a volunteer army , the Soviet Central Government is willing to form a combat agreement with any armed unit of the Kuomintang and fight Japanese imperialism .
Meanwhile , the Soviet Central Government wishes to point out that , while loudly clamoring against Japan and the cease @-@ fire agreement , the traitorous Kuomintang warlords such as Feng Yu @-@ hsiang , Ts &apos;ai T &apos;ing @-@ k &apos;ai , and Ch &apos;en Chi @-@ t &apos;ang are only trying to hoodwink the people .
Actually , some of them have already joined Chiang Kai @-@ shek for a desperate attack on the Red Army and the soviet , while others have become running dogs of Japanese imperialism .
Their vociferous clamor against Japan and the cease @-@ fire agreement is only a means for them to deceive the people and proceed with their treachery .
Besides associating with imperialism to suppress the revolutionary people and revolutionary soldiers and vigorously attacking the soviet areas and the Red Army , they have no other goal .
Revolutionary people and revolutionary soldiers of the entire nation : Only the union of the people &apos;s own armed strength and the anti @-@ Japanese soldiers with the people will we implement a true national revolutionary war and knock down Japan and all imperialists , and overthrowing the traitorous Kuomintang is the prerequisite to the victory of this war .
The Soviet Central Government of China appeals to the people of the whole nation and the revolutionary soldiers to rally under the banner of the soviet , unite with the Red Army , jointly overthrow the regime of the Kuomintang , the traitorous ringleader , defend the independence and territorial integrity of China , and strive for the thorough liberation of the nation !

ON SOLVING THE GRAIN PROBLEM OF THE MASSES
Order No 42 of Central People &apos;s Committee
16 June 1933 _ : . ; \ , , , ^ 1933
&#91; Text &#93; Recently , grain supply has been short , and the price of rice rises every day .
In some individual areas , rice is not available even with money .
Therefore , some of the people have no rice to eat , but live on vegetables and sundry grains , or even tree leaves and grass roots .
This has truly become a serious situation .
The reason is the hoarding by the rich peasants and the manipulation by the merchants ; they deliberately make it difficult for the toiling worker @-@ peasant masses .
The people with a grain surplus still follow the old concept of each one for himself , wait for higher prices before selling , and are completely indifferent to the hunger of the toiling worker @-@ peasant masses .
This is entirely because they do not understand the momentous significance of class mutual help .
The people who have no surplus have not saved a part of their grain to sell to the toiling masses who are short of grain , especially the families of the Red Army soldiers , or to lend the grain to them according to the method of borrowing in the summer and repaying in the fall .
It is still more than a month before the new grain comes to the market .
During this long period , large volumes of grain are needed to relieve the people and the Red Army families .
To solve this problem , we want the governments of all levels to devote their full effort to the following work :
The government of the provincial level must promptly call all types of meetings , conduct enthusiastic and detailed discussions and , according to the actual situations of the counties , formulate its particular , systematic , and concrete plans for discussion and implementation by the lower level .
The county government must , according to the resolutions of the provincial soviet and the experiences of fending grain and saving grain to sell to the Red Armya call district and township delegates &apos; meetings .
( Such meetings may be held in two locations if the distances are too great and the delegates too numerous ) .
Such meetings must include the chairman and the delegates of the poor peasants1 league , labor union , and women &apos;s organization
on the township level , and class mutual help must be explained to the delegates and active elements , so that they will make extensive and enthusiastic propaganda and stimulation when they return , to their own districts and townships .
By so doing , we will activate the masses and raise their spirit of class friendship and mutual help to solve the @-@ current grain difficulty .
In areas suffering the greatest grain difficulty , we may use huang @-@ chin , huang @-@ ch &apos;iu vegetable , t &apos;ung @-@ hao , hemp leaves , creeper bean , and bracken as food supplements .
The district and township governments must thoroughly implement the resolutions of the province and county on this issue , and guide the townships with more grain to help those with less grain .
The villages with more grain must help those with less grain , and the households with more grain must help those with less grain , so that the soviet masses , under the significance of class mutual help , will break down the manipulation of the rich peasants and rice merchants and solve the difficulty of shortage between the green crops and the yellow harvest .
It is hoped that the governments of all levels , upon receipt of this order , will strive to perform the task without neglect .
It is so ordered .

REPORT AT THE LAND INVESTIGATION MOVEMENT RALLY OF RESPONSIBLE PERSONS OF SOVIETS OF THE CH &apos;U LEVEL AND ABOVE OF THE EIGHT COUNTIES
18 @-@ 19 June 1933 ^ 1,
&#91; Text &#93; I.
The Land Investigation Movement Is the Momentous Central Task of a Vast Area
As shown by all past experiences , only when the land issue is correctly solved and the flame of the rural class struggle raised to the maximum height under the firm class slogans will the broad peasant masses become activated and , under the leadership of the proletariat , join the revolutionary war and the soviet constructions of all aspects , build a firm revolutionary base , add a greater strength to the soviet movement , and strive for larger developments and victories .
According to the experiences of the progress of the land revolution , the development of the rural class struggle has its corresponding stages .
The land struggle includes ( 1 ) the stage of confiscating and distributing land , ( 2 ) the stage of land investigation , and ( 3 ) the stage of land construction .
According to the three stages of the land struggle , three types of areas exist in any soviet region : ( 1 ) area of intensive struggle , ( 2 ) area where the struggle lags behind , and ( 3 ) newly developed area .
In the newly developed areas , the land struggle is still in the stage of confiscation and distribution .
The central issue here is to overthrow the political power of the landlord class by force , build a revolutionary provisional political regime ( the revolutionary committee ) , local worker @-@ peasant militia , and revolutionary mass organizations , confiscate the land and assets of the landlord class and the land of the rich , peasants , distribute the land to the farm laborers and poor and middle peasants , allocate the inferior land to the rich peasants , cancel the debts and burn the land deeds and loan agreements .
The struggle in this stage includes the entire period from the time when the revolution and the counterrevolution begin to join in battle to the time of the disposal of the land and assets of the counterrevolutionaries after the revolution has overcome the counterrevolution .
In areas where the struggle is intensive ; &apos; a consolidated soviet political regime has been established , -the.local militia and the revolutionary mass organizations have been extensively developed , the feudal and semi @-@ feudal forces of the &quot; landlords and rich , peasants have been completely subjugated , the land has been thoroughly distributed , and the struggle of the peasant masses on the land issue has progressed to the stage of land improvement and production development .
Therefore , the central issue here is land cons t rue t ion .
In areas where the struggle has dropped behind , the development stage is situated between the two stages discussed above .
The period of provisional political power has progressed to the period of formal political power , but not yet completely consolidated .
The counterrevolutionary struggles of the landlords and rich peasants have been defeated by the revolutionary masses in the first period .
From that time on , many among them , with one shake of the body , took down their counterrevolutionary masks and donned the revolutionary masks , also supporting the revolution and land division and calling themselves impoverished peasants entitled to land allocation .
They were very active and relied on their historical superiorities , &quot; articulate and literate . &quot; Therefore , they stole the fruits of the land revolution during the first period .
The innumerable facts prove that they usurped the provisional political power , infiltrated the local militia , manipulated the revolutionary organizations , and acquired more and better land than the impoverished peasants .
By the time of the second period , as a result of supervision of the higher level government and the development of the mass struggle , the revolutionary committee was reorganized into the soviet , and the mass organizations and local militia were also initially reformed and developed .
A part of the spurious revolutionary elements were purged .
In many areas , the land was divided a second time , or even a third or fourth time .
A part of the land stolen by the landlords and rich peasants was repossessed .
Nevertheless , many class deviationists still remain hidden in the soviet mass organizations and local militia where they &quot; hang out the red belt and address each other as comrades , &quot; where they create rumors and hold secret meetings , and where they revile the masses as &quot; leftwing opportunism , &quot; &quot; hitting the local tyrants indiscriminately , &quot; and &quot; using the public to repay a private grudge . &quot; Or , they &quot; are most enthusiastic in expressing their opinions at meetings but do nothing afterward . &quot; When the struggle is violent , they organize counterrevolutionary secret organizations , such as the Kuomintang , the Social Democratic Party , the AB League , the New Communist Party , and all types of things , for the purpose of sabotaging the revolution and injuring the positive revolutionary elements .
In general , the landlord and rich peasant class uses all kinds of means to suppress the mass struggle , protect their privileges in political power and in land and property , and defend their remnant feudal force .
In such areas , the revolutionary masses and the landowners and rich peasants are waging a severe struggle , except that , unlike the open struggle between the Red and White banners in the first period , it is a struggle between the revolutionary peasant masses and the landlord and rich peasant elements covered
by false masks .
Such , struggle has its special difficulties .
The hidden counterrevolutionaries are unlike the open &apos; counterrevolutionaries whom the peasant masses can see at one glance .
With.the many types of deep @-@ rooted rural feudal relatiOnSj such , as the national relations , it is not an easy matter to raise the class awareness of the peasant masses and make them realize the necessity of the final destruction of the feudal remnants .
Therefore , it is necessary for the Communist Party and the Soviet Government to explain patiently to the peasants , perform much arduous work , and follow the correct class line and mass work method .
Here , the central issue is land investigation and class investigation .
If this issue is not solved , the revolutionary positivity of the peasant masses cannot be developed to its maximum , the remnant feudal forces cannot be completely destroyed , the soviet cannot obtain its maximum consolidation , and such important tasks as expanding the Red Army , raising funds for it , enlarging the local militia , undertaking land and economic constructions , and developing culture and education , cannot attain the maximum success .
Therefore , the land investigation movement is the most central and most important task of these areas .
Take the central soviet areas as an example : The struggle is relatively behind in a large part of such areas .
The land issue has not been solved in the entire 13 counties of Hui @-@ ch &apos;ang , Hsun @-@ wu , An @-@ yuan , .
Hsin @-@ feng , Lo @-@ an , I @-@ huang , Kuang @-@ ch &apos;ang , Shih @-@ chreng , Chien @-@ ning , Li @-@ ch &apos;uan , Ning @-@ hua , Ch &apos;ang @-@ t &apos;ing , and Wu @-@ pTing , the greater portion of the counties of Jui @-@ chin , Yu @-@ tu , Po @-@ sheng , Sheng @-@ li , and Yung @-@ feng , a portion of the counties of Kung @-@ lueh , Wan @-@ t &apos;ai , Kan @-@ hsien , Shang @-@ hang , Yung @-@ ting , and Hsin @-@ ch &apos;uan , and even the districts of Chun @-@ ts ? un and Huang @-@ t &apos;ang in Hsing @-@ kuo ,
The peasant masses of such areas have not been most extensively activated , and the feudal forces have not been finally overcome .
Many class devia @-@ tionists are hidden and active in the soviet political regime , mass organizations , and local militia , and many counterrevolutionary secret organizations pursue surreptitious activities in all areas to sabotage the revolution .
For this reason , the war mobilization and economic and cultural construction of such areas lag far behind the advanced areas ( almost the entire county of Hsing @-@ kuo ; a part of Sheng @-@ li , Kan @-@ hsien , Wan @-@ trai , Kung @-@ lueh , Yung @-@ feng , and Shang @-@ hang ; Huang @-@ p &apos;o District of Po &apos;sheng , Wu @-@ yang District of Jui @-@ chin , Hsin @-@ pTo District of Yuftu , and Ch &apos;i @-@ nan District of Yung @-@ ting ) .
These backward areas constitute almost 80 percent of the central region and their masses number 2 million or more .
To launch a general and intensive land investigation movement in such vast , areas , ignite the flame of the class struggle among the 2 million masses for a final battle with the faudal forces , and knock them down completely constitute the urgent task of the Communist Party and the Soviet Government .
The First Step of the Land Investigation MovementLarge @-@ scale Organizational Mobilization
How do we proceed with the land investigation movement ?
First of .all , it requires organizational mobilization .
As indicated by the experiences in
leading mass struggles in soviet areas , only when the Communist Party , the soviet , and the mass organizations take concerted action under party guidance will we attain success in all .our struggle tasks .
The land investigation movement is a cruel and violent class struggle , a great revolutionary mass movement , the fundamental improvement of the mass organization work of the party and the soviet , and the most important link in the current work .
Only when the entire party and the entire soviet lahor union mobilize all their forces to join this movement will we activate , launch , and complete it .
In regard to the mobilisation of the party , the Central Bureau has already issued a correct directive .
In regard to the mobilization of the soviet , the past error of considering the land investigation the exclusive function of the land department must first be rectified .
Hot only the finance , military affairs , national economy , and education departments considered themselves unrelated to the movement , but the worker @-@ peasant procurators1 department , the judicial department , and the political security bureau also thought that they did not have much to do with it , and even the presidiums paid no attention to it .
This is completely wrong .
We must understand that no part of the soviet may divorce itself from the movement .
First , the government presidiums of all levels must devote their maximum attention to leading the movement .
Next , the land , worker @-@ peasant procurators &apos; , and judicial departments and the national security bureaus of all levels and their special representatives must serve as the main leading and work units in the movement .
To thoroughly solve the land issue in the movement , reform the soviet of the township , district , and county , and purge the rural counterrevolution , the above @-@ named government units must exert their maximum effort .
The finance department must attack the remnant feudal forces by fining the landlords and assessing donations from the rich peasants while increasing the state revenue .
The military affairs department must give attention to the rectification and expansion of the local militia in the land investigation movement and mobilize the positive elements among the masses to join the Red Army .
The national economy department must give attention to the recovery and development of agricultural and handicraft production , the growth of the cooperative , and the balancing of production and consumption in the development of the land investigation movement .
The education department is not without its duties .
It must , for the purpose of deploying the land investigation movement , supply some simple and popular texts and pamphlets to the land investigation cadres and the masses .
With the development of the movement , it must promote the culture and education of the masses .
As the largest majority of labor union members in the soviet areas are in the rural village and closely linked with the land , and as the land investigation movement is a great and violent class struggle , the proletariat must serve as the staunchest leader .
Therefore , be they agricultural , handicraft , or other labor unions , they must , under the leadership of the National General Labor &quot; Union Executive Bureau , mobilize their best cadres and all rural members to participate in the land investigation movement .
The most important thing is to produce a motivating and encouraging effect in the poor peasants * leagues and make firm proposals on land investigation , class investigation , and government reform .
In general , the land investigation movement is not a commonplace trivial task , and it cannot be thoroughly completed in a month , or even 6 months .
Therefore , the party , the league , the government , and the labor union must coordinate for a large @-@ scale mobilization .
Here we will discuss the .
issue of educating @-@ the cadres .
First , a meeting of lower level responsible persons : ; must.be called and.full explanations of the several major issues in the land investigation movement given them .
So far , most of the soviet personnel of the @-@ various levels do not realize that the land investigation movement is an urgent task ; they.do.not know how to distinguish the class classifications ; they fail to understand the lines and methods of winning the masses and launching the struggles .
Therefore , they have not been able to launch @-@ the movement .
Next , such education must also be conducted on the : cadres transferred from the local lower level and from all advanced areas .
Short @-@ term land investigation movement training classes must be held .
The provincial and county governments must hold such training classes many times for the land investigation movement , lasting 1 to 2 weeks , and teaching specially the several major issues in the movement .
The land department , worker @-@ peasant procurators &apos; department , and political security bureau of the provincial , county , and district governments must each organize a group of work personnel ( most of those of the district will remain on their jobs ) and give them full education on land investigation work .
Thirdly , one type of education is conducted in action .
In other words , the provincial and county governments must send men out to inspect the work , and the district level must call a meeting of its own land investigation work personnel and township soviet and poor peasants &apos; league chairmen every 5 to 7 days and inspect their work , because just the first two methods of education alone will not produce the maximum result .
Launch the Land Investigation Movement according to the Development Situation of the Rural Class Struggle
We mentioned in the first chapter that there are three types of areas in the soviet regions :
( 1 ) Areas of intensive struggle ;
( 2 ) Areas where the struggle lags behind ;
( 3 ) Newly developed areas .
Not just in the provinces , but some outlying counties have the same situation .
Yung @-@ feng , for instance , has all three types of areas existing at the same time .
In the majority of the outlying counties , there exist the relatively backward and the newly developed areas .
As for the interior , generally the counties are entirely backward , but relatively advanced are also found .
Most of the districts in Hui @-@ ch &apos;ang , for instance , are backward , but Hsi @-@ chiang District is relatively advanced .
The situation in Jui @-@ chin is different .
Wu @-@ yang District may be considered an area of intensive struggle ; T &apos;ao @-@ huang , Huang @-@ po , Sha @-@ hsin , Jui @-@ lin , Chiu @-@ pao , Yun @-@ chi , Tu @-@ t &apos;ou , and Ch &apos;eng @-@ shih , a total of eight districts are relatively advanced ; the remaining six districts are lagging behind .
Nevertheless , regardless of which district in which county , as long as its soviet has been established and it has gone through the stage of land confiscation and division , usually relatively advanced and relatively backward villages are found .
Is there the situation o unbalanced.development in a village ?
It exists in many areas .
In many areas , the small villages ( .small hamlets ) are advanced and the large villages ( large hamlets ) are backward .
In.other areas , due to the difference in historical hackground , one may find that some individual large villages are advanced , -while some individual small villages are backward .
Such a situation determines our work direction .
When launching the land investigation @-@ movement in each of the counties , districts , townships , and even villages , -we must concentrate our maximum attention on the backward portions and devote our maximum effort to them .
Equal treatment and equal effort are incorrect .
It is even more incorrect to shift the work direction to the areas which are easy to develop and ignore the difficult areas because of the difficulties of winning the masses and launching the struggle in the Backward areas on ground that &quot; it is impossible to fight one &apos;s way in . &quot; In regard to the steps of the work , when it comes to a township , naturally we must start with the villages and hamlets which are easy to activate , but the center of our work plan must still remain with the backward villages and hamlets .
To eliminate the specially backward situation of a certain village or hamlet ( temporarily &quot; impossible to fight one &apos;s way in &quot; ) , it is perfectly proper to start with the villages and hamlets which are easy to handle , thereby influencing the backward villages or hamlets , and activating immediately thereafter their struggles .
But when it comes to a county or district , it is different .
When planning the land investigation movement of a county or district , we must vigorously attack the backward districts and townships to begin with and devote our secondary effort to the relatively advanced ch &apos;us and hsiangs ,
The situation of unbalanced development produces another method , i.e. , mobilizing the cadres from the advanced areas to lead the land investigation movement in the backward areas .
While it is important to mobilize the cadres from Hsing @-@ kuo and other most advanced areas to the backward areas , it is just as urgent to mobilize those of relatively advanced areas to the backward areas .
All advanced and relatively advanced areas must take the responsibility of guiding the backward areas , and all backward areas must emulate the advanced areas .
Only thus will the land investigation movement be rapidly deployed .

CONCLUSIONS OF THE LAND INVESTIGATION MOVEMENT RALLY OF RESPONSIBLE PERSONS OF SOVIETS OF THE DISTRICT LEVEL AND ABOVE OF THE EIGHT COUNTIES
21 June 1933 ; / , j ^ , , c K ; . ? .&apos;
&#91; Text &#93; After hearing the report of Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung , chairman of the Central Government , on the land investigation movement and 5 days of detailed discussions , the Land Investigation Movement Rally of Responsible Persons of Soviets of the District Level and Above of the Counties of Jui @-@ chin , Hui @-@ ch &apos;ang , Yu @-@ tu , Sheng @-@ li , Po @-@ sheng , Shih @-@ ch &apos;eng , Ning @-@ hua , and Ch &apos;ang @-@ t &apos;ing called by the Central Government from 17 to 21 June 1933 , has profoundly understood the importance of the movement .
It feels that , in the great victories of the soviet movement , as the tens of millions of the masses in the soviet areas have established their own political power , confiscated the land of the landlord class for distribution to the peasant masses , and restricted the exploitation of the workers by the capitalists , and as the broad masses have aroused their positivity in the revolutionary victories , great achievements in the revolutionary war and the soviet construction have been made , innumerable enemy attacks repelled , the soviet areas expanded , and the vigorous development of the soviet movement promoted .
All these have been a result of the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the Soviet Government and the positive support of such leaderhsip shown by the broad masses .
However , it does not mean that no serious problem exists in the soviet areas .
Precisely because of the vigorous development of the soviet movement that the class enemies within and without the soviet areas are insanely waging their desperate struggle and resistance .
Outside the soviet areas , the enemies resort to military attacks .
Inside . , they follow another pattern .
The landlords , rich peasants , and class- deviatlbnists eonceal their true counterrevolutionary nature and utilize the opportunities in many soviet areas Where the land issue has not bean completely solved .
Many among them still possess certain economic bases , such as the &quot; many landowner elements whose land and assets have not been completely confiscated and the many : rich peasant elements who have been allocated good land .
Many of them also have infiltrated the soviet organs , mass organizations , and the local militia .
They abuse the prestige of the soviet , suppress the development of the mass struggle , deceive , bribe , and threaten a part of the masses , spread rumors , organize secret
societies , falsely accuse and injure the positive work personnel of the soviet , and pursue all types of conspiratorial and disorderly activities .
Such a situation is actually discovered frequently iri many areas of the central soviet regions .
-Th.e Rally of the Eight Counties feels that this is a serious problem .
To destroy finally the remnant feudal forces , thoroughly solve the land issue , and consolidate the @-@ soviet political power , an extensive and intensive land investigation movement must be launched .
The Rally of the Eight Counties feels that the land investigation movement is actually a cruel and violent class struggle , a great mass revolutionary movement , and the most important link in the current work .
Therefore , the land investigation movement requires a large @-@ scale organizational mobilization , firm Implementation of the class line , and patient and complete mass work .
The Rally unanimously supports the order of the Central Government on the land investigation movement and fully subscribes to the following conclusions .
Organizational Mobilization
All units of the government must take concerted actions .
Not only the land , worker @-@ peasant procurators &apos; , and judicial departments , and the political security bureau must shoulder the main responsibility of the land investigation movement , but the finance , military affairs , national economy , and education departments must also perform all items of necessary work in the movement , while the government- chairman and the presidium must serve as the leaders of the entire movement .
To feel that it is only the function of the land department is wrong .
The county , district , and township levels must all organize land investigation committees , under the governments of the various levels and in charge of the general leadership responsibilities of the movement .
In addition to the responsible persons of the government , the committee members must also include the personnel of mass organizations .
The county soviet must immediately formulate a countywide land investigation movement plan for July .
Thereafter , the land investigation movement plan for the following month must be formulated at the end of each month .
The district soviet must call a meeting of the chairmen of township Soviets and poor peasants &apos; leagues and formulate a plan for the work of the first 7 days .
Thereafter , there must be plan formulation and work inspection every 7 days .
Nevertheless , for those townships which are too far away , the parties concerned may attend the meetings at the district soviet every 14 days .
For those townships which are not too far away , the parties concerned must attend the meetings every 7 days , in order to promote the rapid development of the land Investigation movement .
In regard to the mobilization pattern of the township level , attention must be given to the following : ( 1 ) the township congress , ( 2 ) the labor
union , ( 3 ) the .
poor peasants1 league , ( 4 ) .
the.women &apos;s congress , ( 5 ) the Red Guard and Young Pioneers , ( 6 ) other revolutionary organizations , and ( 7 ) village and hamlet mass meetings .
Only through such , organs , organizations , and mass meetings will the maximum strengths he mobilized into the land investigation movement .
Any method , tending to reduce the sphere , seeking convenience without regard to the majority of the masses , is incorrect .
The county soviet must hold a land investigation movement training class which will include one person from @-@ every township and continue for 10 days .
Then a second training class must be held , also including one person from every township .
The most positive elements among the township soviet congress , poor peasants1 league , and labor union will be selected for training and afterward returned to their original townships to lead the movement .
However , those from the advanced districts and townships must be sent to the backward districts and townships to work .
There must be two classes every month during the 3 months of July , August , and September .
The provincial soviet must select the positive elements from the advanced counties and districts to hold a land investigation movement training class and send the graduates to lead the movement in the backward counties and districts .
For the success of the land investigation movement , the organization of the government departments must be immediately made sound , mainly by eliminating double @-@ duty and the habit of frequent transfers and adding the required work personnel .
The township level must organize a confiscation division committee , elected by the poor peasants1 league and serving under the township soviet , and in charge of confiscating the land and assets of the landlords and rich peasants .
Implementation of the Correct Class Line in the Land Investigation Movement
Relying on the poor peasants , allying with the middle peasants , and enabling the farm laborers to produce a leadership effect in order to completely eliminate the landlord class , block the rich peasants from stealing the land benefits of the revolution , and weaken their economic hold constitute the correct class line and struggle strategy which must be firmly followed in the land investigation movement .
In regard to allying with the middle peasants , it must be started from respecting the interests of the middle peasants .
Without the consent of the parties concerned , the land of the middle peasants ( including the well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants ) must not be divided .
At the beginning of the land investigation , the policy of allying with and respecting the interests of the middle peasants must be generally propagandized .
In , the process of land investigation , the borderline cases between middle and rich peasants must be determined carefully , without any mistake .
In dividing the confiscated land and assets ,
attention must be .
given to &apos; .-the &apos;middle .peasants and the individual impoverished elements among them must not .he left out .
In regard to enabling the farm laborers to produce a leadership.effect , mainly it is by urging them to join the poor peasants1 league and form a farm laborers &apos; cell , in order to rally the positive poor peasant elements through them , develop the poor peasants &apos; league , and hasten the progress of the land investigation movement .
When dividing the confiscated land and assets , the farm laborers must be given priority .
Correctly analyzing the class classifications from the actual social relations is an important part of implementing the class line .
The errors on this issue committed in the past must be promptly rectified .
All actual class classification problems must be solved according to the criteria set forth in &quot; How To Analyze the Classes . &quot; The criteria must be widely explained among the masses , primarily the cadres .
The goal of land investigation is &quot; class investigation , &quot; not land redivision .
The idea that land investigation requires &quot; staking &quot; is incorrect , Only after the conclusion of the cruel struggle of class investigation and when the majority of the masses demand the redivision of certain individual parcels will redivision be permitted .
Such strict distinction is not only for the purpose of stabilizing the land ownership of the peasants , so that they will not be alarmed over the &quot; uncertain land division , &quot; but also for the success of the &quot; class investigation &quot; struggle when we must concentrate our entire force ( especially allying with the middle peasants ) against the resistance of the landlords and rich peasants .
At this time , there must not be any dissension in the peasants &apos; own ranks .
All possible clan and local disputes must be avoided , and all forces united to deploy the struggle against the landlords and rich peasants .
Therefore , activating the impoverished masses of the particular village and the particular clan to clarify the landlords and rich peasants of the said village and the said clan is an important strategy of the land investigation movement .
Similarly , the struggle to break down superstition ( though proper ) must be subordinated to the &quot; class investigation &quot; struggle .
Ill Mass Work
First of all , we must rectify the neglect of winning the majority of the masses in many areas and the bureaucraticist and comtnandist work pattern .
We must understand that only By patient and arduous work to activate and win the masses will we gain the support of the majority , bring out their maximum positivity , and attain the goal of the complete destruction of the feudal remnants .
Such mass work is the only guarantee to the implementation of the class line and must be manifested in the following practical actions in the land investigation movement .
The start of the land investigation movement must be widely propagandized in all the villages and hamlets , and the necessity of the movement
explained to the masses .
Land investigation is class investigation , not land redivision ; class investigation is not an encroachment on the middle peasants .
It is especially important to @-@ explain the distinctions among the landlords , rich , peasants , and middle : peasants to the masses .
Village and hamlet mass meetings must be held nore than once .
The most backward villages and hamlets , especially , - must hold more meetings , so that our land investigation movement propaganda will reach every member of the revolutionary masses .
To attain this goal , we must first explain the movement clearly to the positive elements of the township congress , labor union , poor peasants &apos; league , laboring women &apos;s congress , and other mass organizations and generally and intensively propagandize to the broad masses through them .
After collecting the reports on the classifications of the landlords and rich peasants , the actual investigation must not be performed by only the few persons of the land investigation committee .
The positive elements of the township congress , poor peasants &apos; league , and labor union must be activated to investigate from all sides , uncover and prove to the masses the many complex exploitations and evil activities of the landlords and rich peasantsa and disprove the erroneous reports involving the middle peasants .
After the poor peasants * league has passed on the classifications of the investigated landowners and rich peasants , they must be passed on by the township soviet and approved by the district soviet .
During the process , attention must be given to all the interference and resistance of the landlord and rich peasant elements hidden in the poor peasants &apos; league and the soviet .
In regard to them , they must be severely attacked .
Meanwhile , attention must be given to the erroneous classification of the middle peasants .
Before confiscation , mass meetings must be held in the village and hamlet of the party concerned and the consent of the masses obtained after detailed explanation .
In the past , for the sake of convenience , many areas overlooked such procedure at mass meetings and caused the dissatisfaction of the masses , or even serious clan or local disputes .
Such error must not be repeated hereafter .
In regard to the confiscated property , except cash or its equivalent ( such as gold and silver jewelry ) which must be surrendered to the finance department , all items must be distributed to the impoverished masses .
The erroneous practice of delivering all confiscated property to the government found in many areas in the past must be thoroughly rectified .
When distributing property , a larger portion must be given to the masses in the village where it is located , in order to win their satisfaction .
The grain confiscated at the time of fall harvesting or not long thereafter may , with the consent of the masses , b.e temporarily stored for distribution to the impoverished masses in the following spring and summer .
However , when the masses demand distribution , it must be immediately distributed .
In regard to the confiscated land , besides reserving the public enterprise field and the Red Army public field , it must all be distributed to those who
have been allocated no , or inadequate , land .
The distribution or property and land must be prompt ; there must riot be a long delay after confiscation .
Mass meetings must be held when distributing land and property and lists posted so that everyone will be informed .
Winning the backward villages and hamlets , especially the large villages , is the important task of many areas .
Therefore , attention must be given the following points : ( 1 ) The impoverished masses of the particular village must be activated and its landlords and rich peasants clearly investigated .
( 2 ) Many mass meetings to &quot; discuss the classes &quot; must be held ,
( 3 ) The positive elements must be located and trained properly , even if there is only one of them ; the local masses must &quot; be contacted through them in order to develop the poor peasants1 league and launch the local class struggle .
( 4 ) In areas where the situation is specially serious , the reactionary elements blocking the struggle must first be arrested , tried at public trial mass meetings , and , with the approval of the masses , executed by shooting , and the mass struggle immediately launched thereafter .
( 5 ) In areas where there have been clan wars , &quot; unity agreements &quot; must be signed at the meetings of representatives of the two clans , which must mutually admit their past errors and agree to replace the clan war with the class struggle .
All the foregoing are the necessary methods to win the backward villages and hamlets , especially the large villages .
Here , we must oppose the capitulation of the large villages out of fear , the commandist method of severance from the masses , the opportunist laissez @-@ faire toward the reactionary elements , and the clan , border , and local disputes .
Only thus will we win over the revolutionary masses of all the backward villages and eliminate the feudal remnants in such villages .
The poor peasants &apos; league is an organization which produces a great effect in the land investigation movement .
In some areas where the league is in name only , without substance , it must be organized immediately .
In areas where it has been organized , its positive elements must be immediately rallied , its backward elements won over , and the class deviationists and other evil elements which have infiltrated it firmly purged .
Dissolving and reorganizing the entire league must be avoided as much as possible .
Such a commandist method of dissolving the league just because a meeting cannot be convened after one or two attempts is completely incorrect .
Superior propaganda and stimulation must be used to attract the positive elements to the meetings .
Even when only a minority comes , a meeting must be held , in order to develop the membership .
The league must include all the rural worker masses who are willing to join , and a worker cell must be formed in the league to produce a motivating and leadership effect .
The middle peasants must not join the poor peasants &apos; league , but they may be invited to the meetings as observers , especially when passing on the class classifications .
The three @-@ member managers &apos; committee of the poor peasants1 league must be changed to a five @-@ member committee , a chairman elected among them , and small groups formed below them , consisting of 5 to 15 persons according to their residences .
In regard to poor peasants &apos; league meetings , when the land investigation movement is tense , a meeting may be held once every few days ; after the conclusion of the movement , meetings may be held
according to the regular schedule .
Nevertheless , wlien it comes to frequent meetings , consideration must be given to the feelings of the membership masses , and any coercion is detrimental .
.Before each meeting , the township soviet chairman must direct the poor peasants &apos; league committee to make full preparations of the agenda .
Unprepared meetings are th.e worst habit .
During the land investigation movement , -the @-@ district soviet must call a meeting of the poor peasants1 league chairmen every 7 or 14 days to discuss such issues as how to make sound the organization of the league and how to lead the struggle .
When necessary , a provisional districtwide poor peasants &apos; league congress may be called .
IV , Reform of the Soviet
Reforming the unsound soviet organs in the land investigation movement and turning them into soviets representing the interests of the workers and peasants and possessing full working capacities constitute an important task at the present time .
Reforming the local soviet organ includes two aspects : Purging the undersirable elements and attracting the positive revolutionary elements .
On purging the undesirable elements , the worker @-@ peasant procurators &apos; departments of the county and district must shoulder the main responsibility .
In regard to the method , with the development of the &quot; class investigation &quot; struggle , a prosecution committee is organized on the township level to embark upon prosecution .
The township prosecution committee must include two members of the labor union , five of the poor peasants1 league , two of the women &apos;s congress , one of the youth league light riders &apos; team , and one from the Young Pioneers .
The committee elects two chairmen among themselves and serves directly under the worker @-@ peasant procurators1 department .
The target of prosecution consists mainly of the class deviationists infiltrating the township congress and elements which are completely severed from the worker @-@ peasant interests and have capitulated to or compromised with the landlords and rich peasants .
The method of prosecution is as follows : First , the names and crimes of such elements are listed and posted for the opinions of the masses of the entire township .
Next , after collecting the opinions of the masses , the committee reaches a conclusion .
Thirdly , the conclusion is submitted to the township soviet congress for discussion and for approval of dismissal .
Fourthly , after reporting to the district soviet worker @-@ peasant procurators1 department and with the approval of the district soviet presidium , the dismissals are announced to the masses of the entire township in the name of the worker @-@ peasant procurators1 department .
In the prosecution movement , the shock troops of the worker ^ peasant procurators &apos; department , the correspondents , and the accusation box must be put in full action .
Those with the most serious crimes must also be tried at mass trials and delivered to the judicial departm &amp; nt for handling according to law .
The significance of prosecution and public trial is that , while purging the undesirables in the soviet , the broad masses receive an education so that they will understand the necessity of purging the undesirables from the soviet and supervise and support the soviet .
a result , no such undesirable elements will continue to be found in the soviet .
Prosecutions and public trials must not be expanded to include , as in the past , those who are hot very positive or those who have only made minor errors .
In regard to such elements , mainly we must win them over by criticism and stimulation .
Before a public trial , full propaganda must be made to the masses , explaining the crimes Of the culprit , in order to prevent him from deceiving a part of the backward elements and causing trouble at the meeting ground before the trial .
In areas where there are clan , house boundary , or village boundary disputes , public trials must not be held lightly .
Only when all such nonclass struggles are cleared away and the masses find it necessary will a public trial be held .
The prosecution of the undesirables in the district and county Soviets must , under the gudiance of the worker @-@ peasant procurators &apos; department of the same level , be performed by means of a prosecution committee organised by representatives elected by the mass organizations and the medium and lower level work comrades ( from section chiefs down to cooks ) of the same level .
The procedure and contents of prosecution are roughly the same as those of the township discussed above .
In regard to the soviet prosecution movement launched along with the development of the land investigation movement , the higher level government presidium and worker @-@ peasant procurators &apos; department must guide the lower level with plans , inspect its work from time to time , promptly correct the errors , and collect the concrete experiences for the education of the lower level government presidiums , worker @-@ peasant procurators &apos; departments , and their prosecution committees .
In regard to attracting the positive elements into the soviet , the township level must first call a voters1 mass meeting to elect the bravest and staunchest elements in the land investigation struggle to the township congress and fill the vacancies of the purged undesirables .
Advance preparations must be made for such elections .
Several to a dozen or more substitute representatives may be elected , and it is especially necessary in areas where many new positive elements are emerging , in order to gradually replace the backward representatives who are not completely satisfactory .
The next point is to absorb large groups of new positive elements into the various committees under the jurisdiction of the township soviet , such as the land construction , forestry , water conservation , and education committees , in order to make such committees truly stabilized and functioning .
The third point is to make it possible for the majority of the positive elements in the land investigation struggle to be elected into the township soviet in the general election of the entire soviet area in the fall this year .
On the district level , in the Soviets where there are only a few undesirables in the district executive committee , the functions of the purged members may be taken over by the good elements , and the positive elements in the township Soviets must be promoted to the district soviet .
In individual areas where the undesirables constitute a large portion of the district executive committee , the county soviet must send men to hold a districtwide provisional congress during the land investigation movement and reelect the district soviet .
In regard to.the substitute personnel of the county level , there are the methods of replacing the bad with the good @-@ in county executive committee and selecting and promoting the good elements in the district and township Soviets to work on the county level .
Elimination of the Counterrevolution
The government organs of all levels and the entire system of the state political security bureau must pay serious attention to all the activities of the counterrevolutionary organizations of the hidden landlords and rich peasants and the individual elements of all areas and fundamentally eliminate them in the land investigation movement .
The political security bureau of the provincial , county , and district levels and its special representatives must especially mobilize all their strengths to perform the work of eliminating the counterrevolution , and the error of overlooking counterrevolutionary activities in many areas in the past must be rectified .
Eliminating the counterrevolution in the land investigation movement is mainly by guiding the masses to submit information in conjunction with the class investigation mass struggle , following the thread of the counterrevolution , and arresting the counterrevolutionary elements .
During the period of the land investigation movement , the special representatives of the district security bureau have the authority to make arrests .
After pretrial questioning by the special representatives , the culprits are delivered for trial at the district judicial department .
In case of important culprits , mobile courts must be organized in the hsiang and village of their residences for public trial in the presence of the masses and on @-@ site ^ xecution with their approval .
This will stimulate the hatred and vigilance ^ against the counterrevolution .
The practice of arresting the culprits and delivering them to the county soviet followed in some areas in the past , thereby ignoring the wrath of the masses against the counterrevolution and failing to take the opportunity to educate the masses to exercise continuous vigilance against the counterrevolution , is undesirable .
To attain the goal of eliminating the counterrevolution , the techniques of detection , arrest , trial , and imprisonment must be greatly improved .
Attacking the Landlords and Rich Peasants With Fines and Donations
To fundamentally eliminate all the economic bases of the landlords class and weaken the economic hold of the rich peasants , it is very necessary to attack them by means of imposing fines on the landlords and assessing donations from the rich peasants .
In view of the fact that the majority , or the greater majority , of the landlords and rich peasants of many areas in the eight counties have not been uncovered , we should be able to raise 800,000 yuan in the months of July , August , and September .
The county and district finance departments must devote their maximum effort to this matter .
The main method is to direct the township soviet to mobilize the farm laborers1 unions , poor peasants &apos; leagues , and other mass organizations , which will make surveys of the assets of the landlords and rich peasants ,
decide on toe suitable amounts , o -fines or donations , and strongly urge them to pay .
Here , &apos; the middle peasants must ^ not.oe involved ..
As.for the rich peasants and landlords , a distinction must tie made / In other words , the landlords must he eliminated , while the rich peasants are weakened .
The Relationship Among the Land Investigation Movement , War Mobilization , and Economic and Cultural Construction
In the success of the land investigation movement , it is entirely feasible to raise 80,000 Red Army troops in the eight counties .
It will not take long either .
It is only necessary to launch an extensive and intensive land investigation movement in July , August , and September .
When the broadest masses of the eight counties are all activated , it is entirely feasible to mobilize 80,000 new soldiers to the frontline from the eight counties in 6 to 10 months .
Therefore , the task hinges mainly on the development and intensification of the land investigation movement .
If our effort is not devoted to the land investigation movement , but only to the expansion of the Red Army , then we will not succeed , because it was the fundamental reason for the inadequate achievement of the eight counties in the past when expanding the Red Army .
We must have a profound understanding of this point .
In the success of the land investigation movement , one of the important tasks at the present time is for the eight counties to generally develop cooperatives , mainly those of consumer goods , grain balancing , necessary production tools ( mainly farm tools ) , and loans to the impoverished masses , in order to resist the cruel exploitation of the broad masses by the speculative merchants and develop the economy of the entire soviet area against the enemy blockade .
The great organizational strengths of the soviet and the masses and large sums of capital are needed to wage this battle on the economic front rapidly and extensively .
Therefore , a suggestion has been made to the Central Government to issue 3 million yuan of public bonds to be paid in grain , in order to perform the work promptly .
The completion of this work likewise hinges on the success of the land investigation movement .
If a great effort is not devoted to the land investigation movement and the great majority activated to join the economic construction , it will be impossible to fulfill the task .
Fall harvesting and fall cultivation , the two major undertakings , are close at hand .
They constitute the fundamental crux of the peopled living and the revolutionary war .
Therefore , -we must , in the land investigation movement , strive for their complete success this year .
The extensive development of the culture and education movement also can only be realized in the success of the land investigation movement .
In regard to instances such as one club per 1,000 population , one elementary school per 500 population , one night school per 100 population , and the great majority of those 16 years of age and above enrolled in the literacy classes , when the great majority of the masses have become positive , it is not difficult at all to accomplish .
Currently , Hsing @-@ kuo has almost generally reached such a standard .
It is an excellent example .
Enemy Attack
In the enemies * fourth , &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; of : our .central soviet areas , though bur courageous- Red Army has basically defeated Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s main force on the &apos;northern front , the enemies are still attacking us .
While their disintegration intensifies day by day and they have innumerable other difficulties , they never forget to attack us .
Currently , the enemies in Kwangtung have advanced to Hsun @-@ wu and An ~ yuan , and those in Fukien still maintain a strong position in Shang @-@ hang , Lien @-@ ch &apos;eng , and Ch &apos;ing @-@ liu .
These constitute a great threat to the eight counties @-@ and their vicinities .
To eliminate fundamentally such enemy forces and expel their remnant troops , besides the courageous Red Army , we must mainly rely on a broad mass warfare , and there is still the urgent fighting task of the land investigation movement .
In face of the enemies pressing in on us , not only must we not relax on the land investigation movement , but we must double our effort to deploy it .
We must , in the movement , strive to make positive and arm millions of the masses , eliminate the remnant forces of the landlords and rich peasants serving as the enemies &apos; fifth columnists , and build an ironclad soviet .
Then , our victory over the enemies will be fully assured .
IX .
Supporting the Second All @-@ Soviet Congress With the Success of the Land Investigation Movement
The land investigation movement must be thoroughly completed before the Second All @-@ Soviet Congress on 11 December .
Therefore , the work in July , August , and September must be intensified .
An inspection mass meeting of the land investigation movement of the eight counties must be held in October .
When the Central sends men to the various counties for mobile inspection in August , concrete achievements must be manifested .
To hasten the progress of the movement , the eight counties have voluntarily formed land investigation movement competition agreements and are struggling for their full performance .
Severely Punishing Those Sabotaging and Resisting the Land Investigation Movement
In the cruel struggle of the land investigation movement , the class deviationists and other most evil elements infiltrating the soviet will inevitably sabotage or resist it .
Such elements must be severely punished according to the order of the Central Government on the land investigation movement .
At the rally this time , which is under the direct leadership of the Central Government , when all those attending the rally unanimously supported the policy of the Central Government on the movement and enthusiastically discussed the work , land department chief Huang Yen @-@ pran of Ho @-@ k &apos;ou chfu , Ning @-@ hua , actually expressed his fundamental opposition to the movement .
He was severely criticized and attacked by the small group meeting and the rally .
But from beginning to end , he refused to admit his mistake .
The rally felt that he took the standpoint of the class enemies to resist the land investigation struggle of the broad masses and completely
desecrated the functions of the soviet .
, It : suggested to the &apos; .
Central Government to dismiss him from his post as land department chief and deliver him to the Ning @-@ hua county soviet to have his activities supervised .
Only when such @-@ most evil elements are purged will the revolutionary ranks be rectified , the sabotage and resistance of all class enemies overcome , and the great revolutionary task of the land investigation movement completed .

HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE THE CLASSES
June 1933
&#91; Text &#93; 1 .
What Is a Landlord ?
A landlord is a person who possesses land ( regardless - of the amount ) , performs no , or only incidental , labor , and relies solely on exploitation for his living .
The pattern of exploitation practiced by the landlords is mainly the exploitation of peasants by means of land rent ( including school rent ) .
In addition , they may lend money , hire help , or engage in industry or commerce .
But collecting land rent from the peasants is the main form of their exploitation .
Managing the public hall is also one form of land rent exploitation .
The exploitation by the small landlords among them is more cruel .
Though some landlords have gone bankrupt , they still perform no labor after bankruptcy , but depend on fraud , plunder , and the help of their relatives and friends ; therefore , they are still considered landlords .
The warlords , bureaucrats , local tyrants , and evil gentry are the political representatives of the landlord class and they are especially vicious among the landlords .
The landlord class is the main enemy of the revolution .
The policy of the soviet on the landlord is to confiscate all their property and eliminate the landlord class .
All those helping landlords , collect rent and manage the household and relying on the landlords1 exploitation of the peasants for a living must be included in the same category as landlords .
Those who rely solely , or mostly , on high , interest loans for their living are called usurers .
Though they are not landlords , usury is a feudal exploitation , and all the assets of th.e usurers must be confiscated and the usurers eliminated .
What Is a Rich Peasant ?
Generally , the &quot; rich peasants possess @-@ land , : but there are also those who possess a part of the land @-@ arid rent @-@ a part from others , or who possess no land , but rent -all their land from others ( the latter two categories are of a minority ) .
The rich peasants generally own relatively superior production tools and liquid capital and perform their own labor .
Nevertheless , they usually rely on exploitation for a part , or the greater part in some cases , of their living .
The rich peasants1 pattern of exploitation is mainly exploiting hired labor ( hiring permanent help ) .
In addition , they may rent a part of their land to others and practice exploitation by collecting rent .
Or , they lend money on the side , or engage in business or small industry .
Most of them also manage the public hall .
Some of China &apos;s rich peasants perform their own labor , without hiring help , but exploit the peasants by means of land rents and loan interests .
Rich peasants regularly practice exploitation , it being the major practice for many of them .
The policy of the soviet on the rich peasants is to confiscate their land and only the surplus part of their draft animals , farm tools , and buildings , and allocate land of relatively inferior quality to them .
What Is a Middle Peasant ?
Many of the middle peasants possess land ; some possess a part of the land and rent a part from others ; some have no land at all , but rent all their land from others .
All of them have a fair amount of tools and rely entirely , or mostly , on their own labor .
Generally they do not exploit others , and many of them are exploited through land rents and loan interests .
The middle peasants , in general , do not sell their labor .
Some of them ( including the well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants ) practice partial exploitation , but it is not regular or major .
All those are middle peasants .
The policy of the soviet on the middle peasants is to ally firmly with them .
Without their consent , their land cannot be divided .
Those without adequate land must receive allocations the same as the poor peasants and farm laborers .
What Is a Poor Peasant ?
Some of the poor peasants possess a little land and odd tools , while others have no land at all and only a few odd tools .
Generally , they must rent land from others to cultivate and are exploited through the payment of land rents , loan interests , and hiring out ( generally the poor peasants must sell a portion of their labor ) .
All those in this category are poor peasants .
In land distribution , the poor peasants must receive the same benefits as the middle peasants and farm laborers .
Their existing land and tools are not confiscated .
What la a Worker ?
.
A worker ( including farm laborers ) is someone who has.no land or tools ,
or a .
very small amount of land and a few.tools , and depends completely , or
mainly , on selling his labor @-@ for a living .
In the land revolution , the rural workers .must receive the same land allocations as the poor and middle peasants , and the very small amount of land and tools owned by some of them must not be confiscated .
As for some households which have someone working in the city , that particular person is considered a worker .
If his family in the village rents land out or lends money , but does not rely on the rent as the main source of its living . , his land is not confiscated , and he will receive land allocation the same as the peasants in general .
But if his family relies on collecting rent or making loans as the main source of its living , his land is confiscated , but his wife and children will receive land allocations , while he , himself , will not receive land allocation as he is in the city .

ON PROMOTING GRAIN COOPERATIVES
Announcement No 21 of the Central People &apos;s Committee
4 July 1933
&#91; Text &#93; The central soviet areas were originally large rice producing areas , but there is the situation of partial summer famine this year .
Some of the worker @-@ peasant masses do not have enough rice and they suffer great difficulties .
This deserves our serious attention .
The reason is because the imperialist Kuomintang &apos;s reactionary regime , in its desperate struggle , resorts not only to all political and military measures , but also the policy of economic blockade .
As a result , the supply of industrial products is reduced and prices are high .
To obtain the necessary industrial articles , the masses are forced to sell their new grain at a very cheap price .
Thus , the unscrupulous merchants and rich peasants take the opportunity to manipulate the market and suppress the price of new grain to an alarming extent .
They buy large volumes of grain at the cheapest price , either hoarding it for future profit or &quot; surreptitiously shipping it out , and the masses do not have enough rice to tide them over between spring planting and fall harvesting and have to buy it at a high price .
The unscrupulous merchants and rich peasants again make use of the opportunity to manipulate and raise the price .
In some areas , grain is not available even at a high price .
This is the main reason for the summer famine this year .
Other factors such as the natural disaster last year resulting in a bad harvest , the plunder and destruction of the White army and league bandits in outlying areas , the lack of attention on planned storage on the part of the government , and permitting the export of grain without restriction have all helped create the grain shortage this year .
-To @-@ remedy the situation , the government has formed many measures , such as establishing grain balancing bureaus and trade bureaus in the various areas and preparing to store large volumes of grain for the emergency need of the masses .
Nevertheless , the main method to solve the grain supply problem of the worker @-@ peasant masses is still the grain cooperative .
The toiling worker @-@ peasant masses will solicit capital among themselves .
The shares may be paid for in cash or grain ( converted into cash ) .
After the fall harvest when the members need money , they may sell their grain to the cooperative at a price higher than the market .
After purchasing the grain , the cooperative may store a small part
for the emergency , needs of .its.
members @-@ next year .between spring planting and fall harvesting and ship the greater part to areas where . , the price is high or as export .
This continuous purchasing : and selling will not only expand the capital of the cooperative , &quot; but also enable the members to receive much surplus .
By this means , .
we can stabilize the market , prevent extremes in grain prices throughout the year in the soviet areas , safeguard the peasants from difficulties of grain shortage , -avoid the @-@ cruel exploitation of the unscrupulous merchants and rich peasants , and attain maximum improvement of the life of the workers and peasants .
The toiling worker @-@ peasant masses must immediately mobilize and urge one another .to join the grain cooperative .
The many revolutionary mass organizations must devote their maximum effort to help perform this work .
The responsible comrades of the government of all levels must make the most extensive and intensive propaganda of the significance and effect of the grain cooperative , lead the masses , help the masses , and form at least one grain cooperative in every hsiang .
We must begin now with registration and recording and elect the responsible personnel according to the grain cooperative bylaw issued by the Central Government while building granaries and performing all preparatory work before fall harvest , so that the work can be Immediately started when the new grain comes to the market .
This is an important task to assure the grain supply of the masses , consolidate the soviet political power , and enable the revolutionary war to develop rapidly and successfully ; therefore , it must not be overlooked in the slightest .
It is so announced .

RESOLUTION ON &quot; 1 AUGUST &quot; COMMEMORATION MOVEMENT 11 July 1933
&#91; Text &#93; The 1st of August is the commemorative day of the worldwide anti @-@ imperialist war .
It is also the commemorative day of the Nanchang Uprising in China .
The Chinese Workers1 and Peasants &apos; Red Army was born with the Nanchang Uprising and grew progressively in the course of the struggle .
This year &apos;s &quot; 1 August &quot; comes at a time when the danger of the new imperialist bandit war and anti @-@ Soviet war . ? tremendously intensified , when Japanese imperialism is committing aggression against China on a broad scale , when the Kuomintang is openly selling out the three northeastern provinces , Jehol and North China , it comes at the same time when the high tide of the anti @-@ imperialist and anti @-@ Kuomintang movement is surging throughout the country , and when the Soviet movement and the revolutionary war are winning unparalleled great victories .
Therefore , this year &apos;s &quot; 1 August &quot; has a very great meaning for the revolutionary struggle .

OPEN CABLE MESSAGE AGAINST THE TREASONABLE DARIEN CONFERENCE RECENTLY HELD July 1933
&#91; Text &#93; Revolutionary people of the whole country !
A week ago , the landlord @-@ bourgeoisie Kuomintang government , the eternally faithful running dog of imperialism , in a more sinister and shameless manner than ever before , held a conference in Darien .
On the afternoon of 5 July , a new agreement was concluded at the Japanese Gendarme Headquarters in Darien .
This agreement contains more concrete and more shameless terms than the North China Truce Agreement signed on 30 May !
Amid the din of congratulations from the Deputy Commander of the imperialist Japanese Kwantung Army and near the end of the banquet celebrating their accomplishment of treason , Lei Shou @-@ yun and company , the traitor representative of the Kuomintang government , raised their champagne glasses and shook hands with the representatives of Manchukuo , which the Kuomintang once seemingly called a &quot; puppet , 11 on the one hand greeting the establishment of their newborn ally and on the other hand putting their final signatures on the irrevocable agreement by which they sold out the national interests of China .
The main contents of this new treasonable agreement are : ( 1 ) the Kuomintang government formally recognize Manchukuo and nominally regroup and reorganize the contingents of Manchukuo troops stationed along the Luanchow @-@ Linyu area ; ( 2 ) Japan is allowed to establish surveillance troops in such counties as Mi @-@ yun and Luan @-@ chou in North China ; and ( 3 ) the Lu @-@ Yu section of Peking @-@ Lianong Railway is placed under joint control .
Under the above agreement the Kuomintang has in fact not only formally recognized Manchukuo but even more shamelessly concluded an alliance with that puppet state , thereby swearing allegiance to their common master , imperialist Japan .
Recent facts tell us that the Kuomintang government has yielded to the demand of Manchukuo by permitting within a short time the resumption of postal remittances to and from Manchukuo and altering the existing arrangement of routing Europe @-@ bound mail in transit through Vladivo stock and Siberia .
These hard facts give lie to the Kuomintang allegation before the people that Manchukuo is a so @-@ called &quot; puppet . &quot; This is a completely shameless deceptive propaganda .
As a matter of fact , the Kuomintang itself is a loyal puppet of Japanese imperialism ; they and Manchukuo are both brothers of running dogs .
The Provisional Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic , representing the people of the whole country , is resolutely against the shameless treasonable agreement concluded hy the Kuomintang at the Darien Conference and absolutely denies in toto the terms of this treavsonable agreement .
It calls on the workers , peasants , soldiers and all revolutionaries of the whole nation to rise in unity against the recent treasonable Darien Conference and urges them to engage in persistent revolutionary struggle by going on strikes , closing shops , not attending classes , and abandoning sentry posts , and organize themselves into holding mass demonstrations and forming armed units in order to oppose and prevent the execution of the Darien Agreement .
The people of the whole country must clearly recognize that under the puppet alliance between the Kuomintang and Manchukuo the Japanese imperialist robbers will inevitably expand their acts of aggression on an even larger scale by actively carrying out attacks against Chahar and Suiyuan and seizing the coastal provinces in southeast China with a view to participating with international imperialism in the joint dismemberment of China !
At the same time the Japanese robbers , the oriental gendarme of international imperialism , .will keep up their recent frenzied acts of provocation against the Soviet Union and will certainly embark upon military adventures of open armed intervention against the Soviet Union the fraternal ally of the Chinese people !
Revolutionary people of the whole country !
Only the Soviets can save China !
Only the anti @-@ Japanese Red Army which is accelerating the pace of smashing the fourth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign of the imperialist @-@ Kuomintang is the arm of the revolutionary people of the whole country !
With a view to striving for the national independence and liberation as well as the territorial integrity of China , the Provisional Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic calls on the revolutionary people of the whole country and the revolutionary soldiers in the White army to unite under the Soviet banner and launch their revolutionary national war , knock down the imperialist @-@ Kuomintang and bury them in the grave of history !

213LETTER TO SOVIET GOVERNMENT OF HUANG @-@ PO DISTRICT OF JUI @-@ CHIN COUNTY ON THE LAND INVESTIGATION MOVEMENT
13 July 1933
&#91; Text &#93; Comrades of Huang @-@ po Ch &apos;u :
With the help of the working group of the Central Land Department , you have mobilized the broad masses of workers and peasants in 12 townships of Huang @-@ po District and enthusiastically initiated the movement to investigate land and classes .
In the course of this intense class struggle you have found out 270 or more families of landlords and rich peasants .
They had hitherto been treated as middle and poor peasants .
Some landlords who had been treated as rich peasants were given land and even good farm land .
Compared with 122 cases of landlords and rich peasants which had been disposed of by the soviet government of this district during the past 3 years , this number makes up 70 percent of the total number of cases handled during that period .
In the course of this struggle of the investigation of land ownership and classes , you have confiscated a great amount of land and property which were distributed to poor peasants , suppressed the activities of the reactionaries , heightened the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses in the entire soviet sector , purged a number of alien elements and other elements of the worst type who had sneaked into the soviet sector , absorbed a great many activist workers and peasants into our midst , held new elections of district and township Soviets , and thus greatly consolidated the soviet political power .
This is a great victory in the land ownership investigation movement of Huang @-@ po district .
However , the movement has not been brought to its completion .
There are still remnants of feudal forces at work and certain reactionary activities going on .
This is particularly true in townships of Shang @-@ tuan , Hsin @-@ chuang and Lan @-@ t &apos;ien where some alien and bad elements are covertly or overtly active in deceiving and inciting some of the masses and some of these elements are bent on .
reversing verdicts on past cases .
You must pay utmost attention to such conditions and you must mobilize the masses on the broadest scale in these townships to expose the intrigue of these reactionary elements , continue to investigate the remnant components of landlords and rich peasants , suppress the reactionary elements in Shang @-@ tuan and other townships , prevent their attempt to counterattack and reverse prior verdicts , and tirelessly and unflinchingly lead the masses in their struggle in order to win the final victory in the land investigation movement .
Having carefully examined the investigation forms on which you have determined the composition of class elements , we find that most of your decisions on class elements were correct but a few of them were incorrect .
For example , several families should have been determined as landlords but you had decided them to be rich peasants or even middle peasants .
Your decision on one family was that he was a usurer but he should have been a rich peasant .
In still another case labor power was not filled out clearly ; we hope you will reinvestigate and then decide .
Now with a view to drawing your careful and clear focus on determining the class elements , we enumerate the errors of your decisions on the class elements of 10 families as follows :
( 1 ) Chou Tsung @-@ jen ( a native of Shang @-@ tuan township ) This family has three persons .
They are not engaged in labor ( 20 years ago he had been a long @-@ term laborer for 12 years ) .
He owns land of 50 tan which is completely rented out to others .
Each year he collects a land rent of 25 tan of rice and has been collecting it for 7 years .
He also has 2 strips of hilly land which yields him a few hundred mao a year .
He is a lender of mortgaged land rent of 4 tan from which he deducts 400 yuan .
( You decided him to be a middle peasant )
( 2 ) Hsieh Ming @-@ szu ( a native of Shang @-@ tuan ) with himself as the sole member of the family .
He does not engage in labor .
He owns land of 39 tan which is completely rented out and on which he collects land rent of 16 tan of rice a year ; he has been collecting it for 20 years .
He owns a house which is rented for 1 tan of rice a year and he has been collecting it for 20 or more years .
He lends money totalling 1,040 mao .
In the past he had oppressed people in the rural area and forced the masses to attack the Red Army .
( You decided him to be a rich peasant )
( 3 ) Chu Te @-@ meng ( a native of Hsin @-@ chuang township ) The family has two persons .
They are not engaged in labor .
He owns a land of 41 tan which is com @-@ Oletely rented out to others .
He is a lender of mortgaged land rent of 6 tan .
He has also been a lender of 30 yuan for 8 or 9 years .
( You decided him to be a rich peasant )
( 4 ) Chung T &apos;ung @-@ chi ( a native of Shan @-@ ho township ) The family has two persons .
They are not engaged in labor .
He owns a land of 85 &quot; l / 2 tan .
He regularly hires long @-@ term as well as odd laborers to till 46 !
tan and rents out 39 tan of his land .
He is a lender of 1 tan of new rice .
He manages two pieces of communal land .
( You decided him to be a rich peasant )
( 5 ) Liu.Fang @-@ lo ( a native of Fu @-@ chri township ) The family has three persons .
They do not engage in labor .
He owns a land of 54 tan and rents from others another 10 tan on which he pays a land rent of 2 tan , 90 catties .
Each year he collects land rent of 14 tan on his land of 35 tan which he rents out to others .
He has been collecting it for 8 years .
He hires long @-@ term and short @-@ term laborers to till 29 tan of his land .
He owes a debt of 1,590 mao .
He has been managing 1 piece of communal land for 8 years .
In the past he was influential in the rural area and had oppressed people .
( You decided him to be a rich peasant )
Based on the conditions filled out on the investigation forms and viewed from their land relations and relations of exploitation , the above five families are not middle or rich peasants but are all landlords ( small landlords ) .
In the families of Chou Tsung @-@ jen , Hsieh Ming @-@ szu and Chu Te @-@ ming , no one is engaged in labor .
They rent out all of their land and are wholly dependent on rents for their living .
They are typical specimen of landlords .
Thus your decision of Chou Tsung @-@ jen as a middle peasant and your decision of Hsieh Ming @-@ szu and Chu Te @-@ meng as rich peasants are all wrong .
As for Chimg T &apos;ung @-@ chi and Liu Fang @-@ lo , no member of these families is engaged in labor and all are totally dependent on exploitation .
The difference between them and the other three families is that they rented out a portion of their land and hired long @-@ term laborers to till the other portion of their land at home .
But they are just the same landlords and not rich peasants .
This is because the price of labor power in the rural areas of China is extremely cheap and many of the landlord class have utilized a part of their land and their old farm implements by hiring laborers to till them at their home .
They have most cruelly exploited these laborers in various forms of feudal servitude while at the same time they rent out another part of their land to peasants to be exploited by them .
Here these landlords differ from rich peasants in that they are not engaged in labor themselves whereas rich peasants are so engaged in person .
Because you have overlooked this point , you have erred in your decision .
( 6 ) Hsiao Hsu @-@ chiao ( a native of Yuan @-@ k &apos;eng township ) This family has four persons .
He himself engaged in labor to a small extent ( he was killed during the revolution ) .
He owned a land of 62 tan of which 38 tan were tilled by his long @-@ term laborers ( he had hired long @-@ term laborers for two generations up to the time of the revolution ) .
He rented out 24 tan of his land ( for 36 years ) .
He owned three strips of catalpa tree hilly hand yielding 42 tan of catalpa wood a year .
He lent money amounting to 210 mao .
He managed two pieces of communal land which earned him a land rent of 20 tan of rice a year .
He had been collecting it for 35 years .
He had oppressed people in the past .
( You decided him to be a rich peasant )
( 7 ) Liu Chi @-@ ho ( a native of Hii @-@ ling township ) This family has three persons .
He engages in labor himself to a small extent .
He owns a land of 65 tan of which he hires long @-@ term laborers to till 32 tan and rents out the remainder of 33 tan on which he collects land rent of 15 tan of rice .
He owns three strips of hilly land which yields him over 30 yuan a year .
He has a pond which yields him 20 or more yuan a year .
He rents out six houses collecting rent in kind of 6 tan of rice a year .
He rents out a privy collecting rent in kind of 30 catties of rice a year .
He manages four pieces of communal land on which he collects rent in kind of 89 tan 29 catties of rice a year .
He was quite influential in the rural area .
( You decided him to be a rich peasant )
Both of the above two families rent out a part of their land but at the same time hire long @-@ term and short @-@ term laborers to till another part of their land , They live almost entirely by exploitation .
These facts are identical with
those of the families of Ctmng T &apos;ung @-@ chi and Liu Fang @-@ lo .
The difference lies in that they themselves engage in labor to a small extent but only to a small extent .
Thus they should still be determined as landlords but you were wrong in deciding them to be rich peasants .
This is because rich peasants are actually engaged in production on their land .
Those who engage in light labor to a small extent cannot be said to be rich peasants .
The number of such small landlords who engage in labor to a very small extent but live mostly by exploitation is not Inconsiderable in China .
( 8 ) Ch &apos;ea Tse @-@ hung ( a native Yuan @-@ k &apos;eng township ) The family has five persons .
Only one person is engaged in labor .
He owns land of 62 tan and rents from others another of 10 tan on which he pays land rent of 3 tan of rice .
The land is tilled by himself and by a long @-@ term laborer .
He owns two strips of catalpa tree hilly land which yields him 40 tan of catalpa wood a year .
Each year he hires a long @-@ term laborer as he has done for the last 10 years .
He has been a lender of mortgaged land rent of 3 1 / 2 tan of rice for 3 years .
He has been a money lender totalling 500 mao for 20 or more years .
He rents out a room for 4 mao a year for the 34 years .
In the past he had oppressed people in the rural area .
( You decided him to be a middle peasant )
Ch &apos;en Tse @-@ hung regularly hires long @-@ term laborers .
At the same time he is also a usurer and administrator of communal land .
He relies on exploitation as the main source of his livelihood , but he is actually engaged in production on his land .
This is a typical specimen of a rich peasant in China .
You were wrong in deciding him to be a middle peasant .
( 9 ) Chung Kuo @-@ fang ( a native of Pai @-@ ti township ) This family has nine persons , three of whom are engaged in labor .
He owns a land of 112 tan and three strips of catalpa tree and bamboo hilly land .
He has been lending money totalling 3,200 mao for over 10 years .
He rents out two rooms for 2 yuan a year .
As rent has not been paid , it has accumulated with compound interest to a total of 7,000 or more mao .
( You decided him to be a usurer )
A usurer is one who depends for his livelihood exclusively or mainly on exploitation by lending money at high interest .
The soviet policy on usurers is total confiscation and their elimination .
Chung Kuo @-@ fang owns a land of 120 tan which is completely tilled by himself and makes up the main source of income for his livelihood .
We must not determine him to be a usurer and adopt the policy of eliminating him because he also lends money at high interest It is incorrect to take this kind of excessively left point of view by ignoring his own labor .
The correct decision should be to make him a rich peasant , confiscate his land , his surplus draft animals , farm implements and house , but he should still be given some relatively poor land to be tilled by his own labor .
Why can &apos;t he be called a well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasant ?
Because his exploitation by usury has reached the figure of 10,000 mao and it has been a regular exploitation .
Some rich peasants engage in this kind of exploitation to some extent but this is not regularly done and the amount is certainly not large .
( 10 ) Liu Ch &apos;i @-@ ch &apos;ang ( a native of Pai @-@ ti township ) This family has four persons .
He himself engages in farming to some extent and is also a pig broker .
He owns land of 36 tan and rents from others another of 44 tan on which he pays 15 tan of rice as land rent .
He has two strips of hilly land which yield him 20 tan of catalpa wood and peaches a year .
He has been hiring long @-@ term laborers for 18 years .
He is a lender of mortgaged land rent of 2 tan and 1 lo of new rice .
He manages a communal land which yields him 15 tan of rice a year .
( You decided him to be a landlord )
We have some doubt whether this man should be a landlord .
According to the investigation form , his family has tilled their rice field of 80 tan and two strips of hilly land .
If he hires only one long @-@ term laborer to till them , it would not be enough so the amount of his own labor is probably quite substantial .
If the amount of his own labor is relatively substantial , then he should be determined as a rich peasant .
You should not adopt the policy of eliminating him but should treat him according to the elements of a rich peasant .
Moreover , some landlords rent land to be tilled by long @-@ term laborers , but this is in the minority and the majority of landlords to not rent land from others .
Now this man has rented the greater part of the land from others ; such is frequently the case with rich peasants .
It is , therefore , necessary for you to find out the condition of his own labor before reaching a correct decision whether he should be a landlord or a rich peasant .
If you have clearly established that the amount of his own labor is incidental and quite small , then your decision is a correct one .
The People &apos;s Committee of the Central Land Department
&quot; Red China , &quot; No 95 23 July 1933 13 July 1933
ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONAL PROGRAM OF POOR @-@ PEASANT GROUPS &apos; : 13 July 1933
&#91; Text &#93; Generally speaking , .Poor @-@ peasant Groups have played an important role in the land revolution .
By uniting the broad masses of hired farm laborers and poor peasants and aligning with middle peasants around them , and under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Soviets , they have exerted their overwhelming revolutionary strength in overthrowing the feudal and semi @-@ feudal forces in the rural areas and seized from the landlord class land on which they have actively promoted production .
Moreover , they have also played a great part in the important work of war mobilization , economic mobilization and cultural construction .
Such great revolutionary achievements of the Poor @-@ peasant Groups fully deserve to be commended .
However , viewed from present conditions such achievements have not been made by Poor @-@ peasant Groups in all areas .
Then , too , in the light @-@ of these achievements we cannot ignore a number of shortcomings and errors which exist in their organization and in the execution of their program .
On the contrary , only by viewing their past achievements and at the same time detecting their shortcomings and errors or the inadequacies of their achievements in certain respects can they strive to correct these organizational and operational shortcomings and errors and win still greater victories in the future and fulfil their assigned responsibilities in the soviet movement .
Based on materials from many sources , the Poor @-@ peasant Groups have shown many weaknesses from the organisational and operational standpoint and in some areas they exist in name only and have no actual work at all .
Summing up these materials , we can divide them into two situations : ( 1 ) In some localities a Poor @-@ peasant Group does not exist in a township but only in a village where the Poor @-@ peasant Group has a sub @-@ group under it .
In some other localities there is no Poor @-@ peasant Group in a village but only in a township where the Poor @-@ peasant Group has a sub @-@ group under it .
In still other localities a Poor @-@ peasant Group exists both in a township and in a village ; a village Poor @-@ peasant Group has a sub @-@ group under it .
Under a township or a village Poor @-@ peasant Group there is an executive committee comprised of three operational sections : chairman , organization and propaganda and all sub @-@ groups are directed by the executive committee .
Meetings are held regularly : in some cases full executive meetings are held once every 10 days , and sub @-@ group meetings once
every 5 &quot; days ; in other cases full executive committee meets once a week and sub @-@ groups meet once every 5 days .
Any one who wishes to join a Poor @-@ peasant Group , regardless of whether he is a hired farm laborer or a toil @-@ and @-@ moil poor peasant , must be introduced by 3 persons or he cannot become a member .
Thus many of these farm laborers and peasants are being excluded from the door of the Poor @-@ peasant Group , thereby retarding the development of members and reducing the effectiveness of the Poor @-@ peasant Group .
( 2 ) Even worse than the above is another kind of situation : in some localities it was summarily declared that except landlords , rich peasants and middle peasants , all others were made members of a Poor @-@ peasant Group with someone appointed as its chairman by a Communist Party branch or a township soviet .
With this done a township is deemed to have organized its Poor @-@ peasant Group .
Now this chairman does not know how many members there are , or what kind of work is expected to be done , and no meeting has been held in 3 or 4 months , or even in 6 months or a year .
This kind of Poor @-@ peasant group hanging up an empty name is in reality nothing at all .
Its tasks and the role it is destined to play in the rural area cannot remotely be expected to be accomplished .
Among Poor @-@ peasant group under the first situation , a few have taken over the functions of a government .
For example , such conditions exist in Poor @-@ peasant Group in Lung @-@ kang township , Wu @-@ yang district and in Hsin @-@ chuang and Pai @-@ ts &apos;un townships , Jui @-@ chin County .
The Poor @-@ peasant Group under the second situation described above has no regular work schedule and is disorganized and ineffectual , Both of these phenomena are not good .
However , in many localities of the soviet sector the Poor @-@ peasant Group are organizationally and operationally healthy and well @-@ developed .
The majority of the members , inbued with an intense spirit for struggle , are capable of actively discussing various issues of revolutionary struggle and yet do not encroach upon the functions of their township administration .
They are not only radically different from the Poor @-@ peasant Group of the second type ( hanging up an empty name ) but also more advanced than those of the first type ( with errors ) .
They are truly a model of Poor @-@ peasant Group in the soviet sector and deserve to be emulated by Poor @-@ peasant Group in all areas .
With a view to summing up the past experience of struggle of Poor @-@ peasant Group , unifying their organization , extensively establishing their regular operations , and thus fulfilling their important tasks in the present stage of the revolution , the Central Government , based on its experience in the development of the land struggle and acting on the proposal of the Poor @-@ peasant Group People &apos;s Congress of eight counties of Jui @-@ chin , Hui @-@ ch &apos;ang , Yu @-@ tu , Sheng @-@ li , Po @-@ sheng , Shih @-@ ch &apos;eng , Ning @-@ hua and Ch &apos;ang @-@ ting , promulgates this Organization and Operational Program of the Poor @-@ Peasant Groups and it is hoped that the broad masses of poor peasants in rural areas of the whole country will be united in solidarity and in action under this Program :
( 1 ) A Poor @-@ peasant Group is not purely an organization of one single class but one embracing the broad masses of poor peasants under the jurisdiction of the township Soviets .
At the same time farm laborers must take part and form themselves into workers &apos; sub @-@ groups in order to assume the role of positive leadership inside the organization and unite the poor peasants to become the most reliable pillar of the soviet political power under the leadership of the proletariat .
( 2 ) The function of a Poor @-@ peasant Group is to assist the government in implementing all its laws and decrees but it does not substitute for the work of the government .
It should express its own views on various questions concerning the interests and rights of the workers and peasants and present proposals to the government .
( 3 ) A Poor @-@ peasant Group should pay particular attention to the interests and rights of middle peasants , thus enabling them to center around the Poor @-@ peasant group , form a solid alliance between them and become a strong link in the coalition between the proletariat and the middle peasants , thereby facilitating the struggle to eliminate the landlords and oppose the rich peasants .
( 4 ) Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Soviets can the Poor @-@ peasant Group correctly accomplish all their tasks without being trammeled by such backward peasant ideologies as absolute equalitarianism and localism .
In localities where no Poor @-@ peasant Groups have been set up , they can be promoted by farm labor unions and activist elements among poor peasants .
Farm laborer and handicraft workers &apos; unions must generally accomplish their participation en masse in Poor @-@ peasant Groups in order to realize the constant leadership of the proletariat in Poor @-@ peasant groups .
( 5 ) Activist elements among poor peasants should be absorbed into Poor @-@ peasant Groups during the initial period of its formation in order that it will gradually become an organization of all poor peasants .
With a view to attracting the latter to participate in Poor @-@ peasant Groups ( those bad elements who sabotaged the land revolution and protected landlords and rich peasants naturally cannot join even if they are poor peasants ) , old members of Poor @-@ peasant Groups should constantly be responsible for carrying out extensive propaganda work and actively looking for poor peasants and farm laborers to join without the formality of introduction but opening the door wide and leading them into Poor @-@ peasant Groups .
Participation in Poor @-@ peasant groups should be based on the principle of one &apos;s own free will .
All farm laborers and poor peasants , men and women , old and young , may enroll and join .
It is wrong to use the method of deputizing people from each household .
With a view to strictly preventing landlords and rich peasants from sneaking into Poor @-@ peasant Groups , all new members , whether they were found by old members or voluntarily enrolled themselves , must be scrutinized according to the criteria of analyzing classes and they should be immediately expelled if they were discovered to be incorrect elements .
This will protect the Poor @-@ peasant groups from being infiltrated by landlords and rich peasants .
( 6 ) During the period when land struggle is being launched or land ownership investigation movement is being carried out , if Poor @-@ peasant Group has produced a contrary effect because it was loosely organized and ineffectual in the past or because it was dominated by a small minority of landlords and rich peasants , it would be totally incorrect to adopt the method of commandism by dissolving and reorganizing the Poor @-@ peasant Group for this would be departing from the masses .
The proper measure to take at such time is to unite the activist elements among poor peasants and intensify their education so that they will
initiate vigorous struggle within the Poor @-@ peasant Group to expose the swindles of landlords and rich peasants , strive to keep the members from being influenced by them , and resolutely purge them as well as those bad elements who can no longer be individually re @-@ educated from the Poor @-@ peasant Group , thereby strengthening the fighting power of the Poor @-@ peasant Group and seizing total victory of the land struggle and land ownership investigation movement .
If the Poor @-@ peasant Group has middle peasants as members , it is impossible to treat them as landlords and rich peasants and consider the job done once they are purged .
It is necessary to go through a process of clear explanation by telling them why they need not take part in the Poor @-@ peasant Group and that after leaving the Poor @-@ peasant Group they can still attend its meetings as observers and all middle peasants are welcome to attend and listen .
( 7 ) As the Poor @-@ peasant Group is not purely an organization of one single class , it does not require a strict organizational form of a trade union , nor does it need definite bylaws or payment of membership dues ( when money is needed , members may be asked to make temporary contributions at general meetings ) .
Still less does it need a structural system at a provincial , county or district level .
It is only necessary to organize the Poor @-@ peasant Group at a township level .
A township Poor @-@ peasant Group has sub @-@ groups under it , A sub @-@ group takes one house ( one tiny hamlet ) as a unit with members of each house forming a sub @-@ group .
If , however , a house has very few families and thus very few members , then 2 or 3 neighboring houses can form themselves into a sub @-@ group .
On the other hand , if one house contains a score or more of families and thus a great number of members , it can be organized into several sub @-@ groups .
( 8 ) To facilitate the work of the Poor @-@ peasant Group , the people &apos;s congress should nominate 3 persons ( most activist elements ) to form a committee .
The Poor @-@ peasant Group in a larger township or with many members may nominate 5 persons to 7 persons to form a committee .
A chairman is nominated by the committee to take charge of over @-@ all work and no other working section will be established .
Poor @-@ peasant Groups should practice a liberal system of revolutionary democracy .
Important questions must be discussed by the people &apos;s congress called for : that purpose ; only ordinary questions are discussed by the committee alone or with the participation of sub @-@ group chiefs at its request .
( 9 ) Meetings of Poor @-@ peasant Group people1s congress , committees and subgroups should not be mechanically scheduled at fixed time to avoid formalism and diminish the interests of the members .
A meeting should be called promptly when important questions arise .
During the period when class struggle becomes particularly intense in rural areas such as during land distribution and land ownership investigations , membership meetings should be held once every 3 or 4 days or 5 or 6 days , and committee and sub @-@ group meetings once every 2 or 3 days .
( 10 ) The work of the Poor @-@ peasant Group should be focused on the interests of workers , poor peasants and middle peasants at all times and undertaken to strive for the consolidation and development of the soviet political power .
The important items of the work of Poor @-@ peasant Groups are enumerated as follows :
( a ) On the question of confiscating and distributing land , houses , farm implements and other property of local tyrants , evil gentry and landlords and the land , surplus draft animals , farm implements and houses of rich peasants , discussion of this question should be centered on how to deal with the resistance of landlords and rich peasants and how to let the benefits of the land revolution fall into the hands of workers , poor peasants and middle peasants .
Here special attention must be paid not to harm the interests of middle peasants but to effect a close alignment with them .
Attention must be drawn to the total elimination of feudal influence in rural areas , without letting landlords and rich peasants pretend themselves to be middle peasants and poor peasants in order to steal their land benefits and no effort should be spared to the extent that not a single landlord shall be allowed to keep 1 ts &apos;un of land and not a single rich peasant shall be allowed to steal one strip of good land .
( b ) Discussion of questions of farm production , such as how to carry out the movements of spring planting , summer planting , autumn harvest and autumn planting , how to increase manpower and fertilizer , improve seeds , develop conservancy works , redistribute draft animals , buy farm implements , eradicate pests , reclaim barren land , plant trees , and protect mountains and forests .
( c ) Discussion of questions , of economic mobilization .
In addition to the development of farm production as described above , the main question to be discussed is how to develop cooperatives such as cooperatives of food @-@ grains , consumers , credit , production and farm cattle in order to promote the large @-@ scale development of the national economy to resist the cruel exploitation of merchants and smash the economic blockade of the enemy , thereby further improving the livelihood of the masses and substantially reinforcing the powerful strength of the revolutionary war .
( d ) Discussion of questions of relief to famine and starvation such as how to render mutual help in food , seeds , farming cattle and farm implements during periods of famine and how to devise ways and means of giving relief to victims in areas harassed by enemy disturbances .
( e ) Discussion of questions of public health of the masses such as initiating universal health campaigns , talking about .sweep @-@ out and clean @-@ up campaigns to combat sickness and pestilence and protect the health and living of the masses .
( f ) Discussion of questions of preferential treatment of Red Army personnel such as the cultivation , harvest and conservation of Red Army public land , helping Red Army families till their land and carrying out the regulations governing the preferential treatment of Red Army personnel .
( g ) Discussion of questions of war mobilization .
Here the first question is the expansion of the Red Army , the second is the raising of funds to help the Red Army , the third is to comfort the Red Army , and the fourth is to expand the Red Guard contingents and the Red Guard Young Pioneers units .
These are all extremely important questions of war mobilization .
( h ) Discussion of questions of participation in soviet election and accusation campaigns such as to insure the election of activist elements among workers and poor peasants during elections and attract the best elements of middle peasants to take part in soviet work .
When alien class elements are found to have sneaked into the soviet ranks or when corrupt , passive and sabotaging elements are discovered , participate in accusation campaigns called by the workers &apos; and peasants &apos; investigatory department and initiate self @-@ criticism by soviet workers in order to insure the absolute health of soviet work .
( i ) Discussion of questions of how to completely carry out all soviet laws , decrees , resolutions and orders in all local townships .
( j ) Discussion of any major questions which arise at any time .
Poor @-@ peasant Groups must constantly discuss all of the above questions , actively present proposals to the government , and resolutely participate in all struggles on the revolutionary front under the leadership of the government for the complete fulfilment of various revolutionary tasks .
Only thus can they constantly have their own work and truly earn benefits for workers , poor peasants and middle peasants without becoming an empty organization which exists in name only .
( 11 ) With a view to further strengthening the proletarian leadership of the peasant masses in rural areas , Poor @-@ peasant Group committees ( a few activist poor peasants may be elected to go along ) may propose to hold joint meetings with the leading bodies of farm labor unions and handicraft workers &apos; unions .
Such joint meetings should be called by labor unions .
They may be held to discuss , for example , the organization of Support the Red Army Committee , Anti @-@ imperialism and Support Soviet League , Revolutionary Mutual Help Society , and certain commemorative and demonstration mass meetings and to strive for their realization by common effort and with unanimous consent .

DECISION OF CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ON THE REDEMARCATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE
AREAS
21 July 1933
&#91; Text &#93; The demarcation of the soviet administrative areas is absolutely different in principle from the demarcation o those of the old reactionary government .
The scope of administrative areas of the old reactionary government was very extensive because they were bureaucratic organs far removed from the masses and their aim was only to weaken and oppress the people .
The principle upon which the demarcation of the soviet administrative areas is based is in complete contrast because they must be as close to the people as possible and work for the benefit of the masses .
Thus the range of a town , district , county and province must not be too large .
The central soviet areas have undergone not a few changes in demarcation , but they have , generally speaking , kept their old boundaries without any fundamental alterations .
This has greatly hampered the work of war mobilization and economic and cultural construction .
Therefore , it is resolved by the Central Executive Committee to redemarcate the administrative areas of the Central soviet sector and stipulates the standards of their demarcation at various levels as follows :
( A ) City : Apart from its own area , a city may govern portions of a town and village within its environs but their area should not exceed 5 li .
( B ) Township :
( 1 ) Township of 1st class .
In a densely populated area on the plain , each township should as a standard rule govern a population of 2,000 .
If a village or several villages in the vicinity have a population of more than 2,000 , a township soviet may govern a larger population but it must not exceed the maximum of 2,500 people .
At the same time if for reasons of topography ( such as rivers and streams ) it is desirable to divide one township into two , thereby reducing the population of one township to less than 2,500 , then that township soviet may govern a smaller population .
( 2 ) Township of 2d class .
In a locality intermixed with plains and hills where the population is not as dense as that of a township of 1st class and where the area is wider , a township may as a standard rule govern a population of 1,500 .
If for reasons of topography it is desirable for a township soviet to cover a wider or smaller area , the population of such a township may be more or less than 1,500 people .
( 3 ) Township of 3rd class .
In a hilly locality with a sparse population , each township as a standard rule may govern a population of 1,000 .
If for reasons of topography it is desirable for certain villages and hamlets to be governed by one township , then the population of such a township may exceed 1,000 but its area must not be too extensive or it would run counter to the soviet principle of being close to the masses .
At the same time if for topographic reasons it is not desirable for a township soviet to govern a larger population , then its population may be less than 1,000 .
In a locality surrounded by big mountains where the area is exceptionally extensive and the population exceptionally sparse , the population of such a township may be as small as 400 but not less than 250 as a minimum .
( C ) District : Each district should as a standard rule govern seven townships .
In a locality on the plain with an unusually dense population , such a district may govern nine townships .
In a hilly and expansive locality with an unusually sparse population , the number of townships governed by a district may be reduced to five townships .
( D ) County and Province : The demarcation of administrative areas of a county and a province shall be entrusted to the People &apos;s Committee and shall be governed by decree based on the principle of being close to @-@ the masses .
\
All soviet districts outside the Central Soviet sector should re @-@ examine their administrative areas in accordance with the principle enunciated in this decision and any district whose area is too extensive should be redemarcated in conformity with this principle .
Upon publication of this decision , &quot; the Provisional Regulations Governing the Demarcation of Administrative Areas in the Chinese Soviet Republic &quot; promulgated in December 1931 shall be declared null and void .

DECISION OF CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ON THE ISSUANCE OF ECONOMIC CONSTRUCTION BONDS
22 July 1933
&#91; Text &#93; Drastic developments of the revolutionary war require the Soviets to mobilize all forces to carry out economic construction in a planned way .
From the standpoint of such economic construction , the masses should be organized into broadly developing cooperatives , coordinating the production and marketing of foodgrains and all products , and promoting external trade to smash the enemy &apos;s economic blockade and the ruthless exploitation of traitor merchants , thereby further improving the livelihood of the masses and enabling the revolutionary war to gain more substantial material strength .
This then is the major fighting task at the present time .
With a view to vigorously carrying out the work of economic construction , the Central Executive Committee has approved the proposal at the workers1 mass meeting of the Land Ownership Investigation Movement and the Poor Peasant Group People &apos;s Congress of eight county Soviets of Jui @-@ chin , Hui @-@ ch / ang , Yu @-@ tu , Sheng @-@ li , Po @-@ sheng , Shih @-@ ch &apos;eng , Ning @-@ hua and Ch &apos;ent @-@ t &apos;ing for the issuance of Economic Construction Bonds in the amount of 3,000,000 yuan and permits the purchasers of these bonds to make payment freely either by foodgrains or in money .
Apart from using a part of the proceeds for present military expenses , the main portion of the proceeds will be spent in developing cooperatives , redistributing foodgrains and expanding external trade .
For the purpose of ascertaining the use of these bonds and the procedure of payment of their principal and interest , the Central Executive Committee hereby enacts the Regulations Governing the Issuance of Economic Construction Bonds .
It charges the People &apos;s Committee with the responsibility of urging the People &apos;s Finance Department and the People &apos;s National Economy Department to direct local governments to issue and distribute these bonds correctly and promptly in accordance with this decision and these regulations and at the same time to make broad publicity and explanation to workers and peasants as well as all residents who abide by soviet laws and decrees so that economic construction can be speedily launched throughout the soviet areas .
Any anti @-@ revolutionary elements attempting to sabotage the faith and credit of the bonds and any economic measures will be severely suppressed by necessary measures to be adopted by the National Political Defense Bureau in order to insure the satisfactory implementation of the work of economic construction .

NEW SITUATION AND NEW TASKS July 1933
&#91; Text &#93; Relying on the correct offensive line of the Party and the positive leadership of the Soviets , relying on the heroic combat and enthusiastic support of the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army and the masses , and relying on the daily struggle of the working and peasant masses in the White sector and the unprecedented vigorous advance of the anti @-@ imperialist and anti @-@ Kuomintang mass movements we have in the wake of the battle of Tung @-@ huang @-@ p &apos;i essentially smashed the enemy &apos;s fourth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign .
In the unparalleled great glorious victory of the battle of Tung @-@ huang @-@ p ! i , the heroic Red Army has dealt a most fatal blow to the Kuomintang warlord chieftain Chiang Kai @-@ shek , the most formidable pillar of the landlord @-@ bourgeoisie !
In his tearful &quot; handwritten order &quot; and other correspondence , he mournfully admitted that this is their &quot; secret sorrow since the day of birth . &quot; ( Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s letter to Chen Cheng ) This is an unprecedented grievous defeat and collapse of their army !
Consequently after they had suffered this grievous defeat , even though they attempted to launch counterattacks on several occasions , they were found powerless to do so in the end !
The reasons why the Kuomintang warlords have suffered this grievous defeat and why they have not been able to counterattack are : First , it is due to the stout prowess and heroic combat skill of the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army .
In the great victory of Tung @-@ huang @-@ p1i , they received enormous reinforcements to strengthen themselves .
The soviet sector has also gained tremendous consolidation and development .
The majority of the Kuomintang soldiers were fundamentally shaken and unwilling to attack the Red Army .
Even the reactionary Kuomintang army officers were mostly scared to death and when they spoke of the Red Army , they were like &quot; speaking of the tiger making them pale . &quot; Thus despite the repeated attempts of Chiang Kai @-@ shek to launch counterattacks , he has been powerless to do so in the end .
Second , it is due to the deepening and continuing aggravation of the national crisis in China .
At a time when Japanese imperialism had occupied Jehol and Luan @-@ tung and were closing in on Peking and Tientsin and when the Kuomintang continued to surrender without shame , the anti @-@ imperialist and anti @-@ Kuomintang revolutionary storm has surged to a new height * This has made it inevitable for the Kuomintang on the one hand to conclude the agreement of surrender with Japanese imperialism finalizing the sell @-@ out of Peking , Tientsin and North China and on the other hand
carry out an unparalleled White reign of terror to suppress the anti @-@ imperialist and anti @-@ Kuomintang roaring revolutionary masses .
Third , it is due to the general collapse of the national economy which has subjected hundreds of millions of workers and peasants to an unprecedented catastrophe from a subhuman enslaved standard .of living to the bitter sea of starvation , death and homeless destitution .
As a result , workers &apos; strikes and peasant uprisings erupted throughout the country on a tremendous scale , turning their struggle for daily living into a political struggle against imperialism and the Kuomintanf These revolutionary struggles have obstructed our enemy and forced them into a state of shock and helplessness .
Meanwhile the diminished receipts of customs revenue of the Kuomintang government and the exodus of workers and peasants into soviet areas thereby escaping from the range of their exploitation , have brought the finances of the Kuomintang government to the verge of bankruptcy !
Confronted with such a grave defeat and hopeless circumstances , the only &quot; strategem &quot; of the Kuomintang warlords is to surrender themselves even more vilely and shamelessly to imperialism .
From the hands of international imperialism they sought and received large batches of loans and munitions which enabled them to mount their fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign against the soviet areas and the Red Army .
The signing of the North China Truce Agreement and the travels of Sung Tsu @-@ wen &#91; T.V.
Soong &#93; to Europe and America are precisely aimed at implementing their intrigue .
Now a new bargain has been struck between the Kuomintang and imperialism .
The Kuomintang has given away 4,000,000 or more square 11 of China &apos;s territory and many secret and unannounced gifts for which they received several hundred million yuan of loans and large supplies of arms and munitions .
Utilizing these loans and supplies of arms and munitions , the Kuomintang , under the direct command and organization of various imperialist countries , has been deploying their troops in North China and elsewhere , training many new contingents in the making of poisonous gas bombs , and concentrating all their forces to organize their fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign and launch their frenzied but futile attack against the Red Army in the soviet areas which will certainly be doomed to defeat !
Thus we are now confronted with a new revolutionary situation .
In the face of such a new situation , our task is to mobilize all our forces and concentrate them to smash the iraperialist @-@ Kuomititang &apos;s fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign !
This is a great historical turning point .
Two types of political power : the soviet political power of workers , peasants and soldiers and the Kuomintang regime of the landlord @-@ bourgeoisie , will in the course of the impending war on a broader scale unfold this kind of the futureour soviet political power will advance with more victories and their Kuomintang regime will collapse with more death and destruction .
With a view to striving for total victory in the smashing of the enemy &apos;s &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign , we must first and foremost increase and concentrate all our forces to heighten , our confidence in victory and offer our all to the war !
In this connection we must above all else insure the steady increase of the numbers of the Red Army and expand it to 504000 during August , September , and October this year .
At the same time we must vastly raise the political education and military skill of the Red Army fighters
and enlarge and strengthen the organization of the Red Guards 2nd Young Pioneers .
Next we must insure ample supplies of provisions for the Red Army and daily necessities for the living of the masses .
Here we must broadly unfold the land investigation movement , deepen the class struggle in the cities and rural areas , absolutely consolidate the soviet political power , develop the national economy in a planned wayj widely establish cooperatives of the masses , issue economic construction bonds , redistribute foodgrains , expand external trade , break the enemy &apos;s economic blockade , and seize material conditions of the revolutionary war .
These are our important fighting tasks at the present time ! !
Finally , with a view to successfully carrying out war emergency mobilization and totally smashing the enemyTs fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign , we must oppose the inadequacies of the assessment of the present new revolutionary situation , oppose all psychological fatigue of the war , in particular oppose those opportunists who have shown alarm and helplessness and wanted to beat a retreat in the face of the enemy &apos;s fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign !
At the same time we must also oppose those &quot; left &quot; determinists of empty talk and victory !
These &quot; left &quot; and rightist opportunists are the fiercest enemies of war mobilization and they actually help our class enemies !
Workers , peasants and Red soldiers of the whole soviet sector !
Now we are confronted with a new revolutionary situation .
We must sacrifice our all and assume our great historical mission !
Comrades !
We are now in the face of the more cruel and devastating battle of the war !
We are now in the face of totally smashing the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign and we are also in the face of the first victory in the revolution of Kiangsi and several other neighboring provinces !

PROCLAMATION OF PROVISIONAL CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ON CONVENING THE SECOND NATIONAL SOVIET CONGRESS
1 August 1933
&#91; Text &#93; It has been 2 full years now since the convening of the First National Soviet Congress .
These 2 years have been the years in which imperialism has frantically intensified its attacks against the Soviet Union and the Chinese revolution , the imperialist Kuomintang has carried out its most barbarous massacre and encircling attacks against the soviet areas of the whole country , and the Kuomintang has sold out China by shamelessly surrendering to Japanese and all other imperialisms .
But these have also been the 2 years in which under the correct leadership of the Central Soviet Government the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army has won great glorious victories through arduous struggle .
During the struggle of these 2 years we have expanded and consolidated our soviet political power and we have gained infinitely rich and invaluable experience .
With a view to focusing our leadership of China &apos;s national soviet movement , further developing and consolidating the soviet political power , and summing up the soviet experience of the past 2 years , the Central Soviet Government decides to convene the Second National Soviet Congress in the Red capital of Jui @-@ chin on the 6th anniversary of the Canton Uprising ( 11 December 1933 ) .
During the past 2 years , China &apos;s national crisis has worsened .
The intensified aggression of imperialism and the selling out by the Kuomintang have brought several million li of Chinese territory in the three northeastern Provinces , Jehol , Peking and Tientsin and tens of millions of Chinese people under the iron yoke of Japanese imperialism .
Because of the consistent surrender and selling out by the Kuomintang , the imperialist dismemberment of China has advanced rapidly .
The tragic fate of the complete colonization of China has been hanging over the heads of the Chinese people in the whole country .
During the past 2 years the total collapse of the Chinese national economy has become ever more acute .
The wholesale bankruptcies of national industries , the ultimate collapse of the rural economy , and the widespread incidence of floods , drought and famine all over the land have driven the overwhelming majority of workers and peasants to the road of joblessness , starvation and death .
Yet the Kuomintang warlords just keep on exploiting the people without any letup .
In Szechwan Province they have already levied land rents in advance to the year 1971 , and the number and variety of exorbitant taxes and
taxes and miscellaneous contributions have reached a total of 1,700 or more .
Throughout the country landlords and evil gentry have exploited the peasants more ruthlessly than .
ever .
Capitalists have also intensified their attack against the workers .
Conflicts and internecine wars between and among the warlords have further quickened the pace of the collapse of China &apos;s national economy .
The pain and suffering of the workers and peasants in the whole country have truly reached indescribable proportions !
Dear comrades !
The workers and peasants of China cannot and will not tolerate such a state of affairs .
The fires of the revolutionary torches are burning all over the country and the heroic struggle against imperialism and the Kuomintang is unfolding itselffrom demonstrations , strikes , riots to geurilla warfare and large @-@ scale revolutionary war .
Furthermore , during the past 2 years the great victories of the Chinese soviet workers and peasants and the Red Army , the tremendous developments of the soviet areas , and the vigorous expansion of the heroic Red Army from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands constitute the most powerful lever in the development of the revolutionary situation in China .
Now two roads lie ahead of the Chinese people : the imperialist @-@ Kuomintang road and the soviet road !
Under the rule of the imperialist @-@ Kuomintang , China can only become completely the colony of imperialism whereas under the soviet political power imperialism has already been totally overthrown .
Representing the revolutionary masses of the whole country , the Central Soviet Government has formally declared war against Japan .
It has on the one hand led the heroic Red Army in vigorously launching the national revolutionary war and defeating the Kuomintang warlords who had prevented the Red Army from advancing north to resist Japan and on the other hand several times called on the White armed forces of the whole country to cease attacking the soviet areas and conclude with the Red Army an agreement of war against Japan .
Under the rule of the imperialist @-@ Kuomintang , the workers , peasants and soldiers have been suffering from the ruthless exploitation and suppression of the evil gentry , landlord @-@ bourgeoisie and Kuomintang warlords and driven into bankruptcy and jobless @-@ ness , even death and starvation .
Under the soviet political power , feudal and semi @-@ feudal exploitation by the evil gentry and landlords has been completely eliminated .
Here laboring peasants and Red fighters have been awarded land , the working class has received the protection of labor laws , the soviet economic construction is surging vigorously ahead , and the livelihood of the workers and peasants has been greatly improved .
Under the rule of the imperialist @-@ Kuomintang , workers and peasants have been frequently subjected to arrest , imprisonment and slaughter .
All freedom of speech , assembly , conscience , and in particular the freedom to resist Japan and oppose imperialism has been denied , and the organs of political power are completely in the hands of a small minority of landlords and capitalists .
On the other hand , under the soviet political , power workers and peasants have gained their complete political freedom and the exploiting class ( capitalists , landlords , rich peasants , etc . ) has been deprived of its political rights .
For the first time in the history of China workers and peasants govern their own country and become its ruling class with the working class as its leading force .
It cannot be pointed out
more clearly by all this that the only road to save China is the soviet road and that the victory of the soviet revolution is the victory of the people of the whole country against imperialism and the landlord @-@ bourgeosie .
It is precisely for this reason that the Kuomintang and all counterrevolutionary cliques , under the .direct command and organization of imperialism , have mobilized all their forces to mount futile attacks against the soviet sector and the Red Army .
Although the enemy &apos;s 1st , 2d , 3rd and 4th &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaigns have been totally smashed by the iron fists of the heroic Red Army , the imperialist @-@ Kuomintang , with a view to making its last stand , is actively preparing to launch even more cruelly its fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; major campaign which is aimed at the complete destruction of the Soviets and the Red Army .
This &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign of the imperialist @-@ Kuomintang is a necessary and major step on the way to the seizure of China as a colony .
All people of China should concentrate all their forces to smash this &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign and fight for the victory of Soviet China .
The Central Government of Soviet China calls on the toiling masses of the workers and peasants and the revolutionary soldiers to rise against the imperialist aggression and selling out by the Kuomintang , against the imperialist @-@ Kuomintang &apos;s fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign against the Soviet Red Army , to smash this campaign , overthrow the Kuomintang rule of the landlord @-@ bourgeoisie , support the Second National Soviet Congress , and elect delegates to this Congress fighting for the future of Soviet China .
Relying on the enthusiasm of the Chinese people for their revolutionary struggle , relying on the invincibility of our heroic Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army and relying on the correct leadership of the staunch proletariat of China and their vanguard the Communist Party , the victory will surely be ours !
People of all China , rise enthusiastically to struggle for a new Soviet China !
Long live the Second National Soviet Congress !

Cable from the Central Government to the International Anti @-@ imperialist and Anti @-@ war Congress , 30 August 1933
&#91; Text &#93; Delegates to the International Anti ^ itnperialist and Anti @-@ war Congress , and Proletariat , Toiling Masses , and All Revolutionaries of the Whole World !
The intensification of the panic of world capitalism and the end of the temporary stabilization of postwar capitalism have caused the imperialist bourgeoisie to launch more reckless attacks on the proletariat and toiling masses of their own nations , to place all the burdens of the economic crisis on them , and to handle the organizations of the worker class and all revolutionary actions with the most cruel fascist bloody means .
In Germany , in Italy , in Japan , and in all the capitalist nations in the world , the mad tide of fascism is waging a death struggle against the revolutionary movement of the worker class and toiling masses of the whole world .
Towards the outside , the imperialist nations are preparing to launch an imperialist war in order to find a way out of the economic crisis .
Their attack on Soviet Russia and their plunder of the colonies have been reenforced .
By means of a bandit war , Japanese imperialism first occupied the vast areas of China &apos;s Manchuria , Jehol , Chahar , and Lo @-@ tung and placed 50 million toiling masses under its heel .
British imperialism is using Tibetan troops in western China to occupy our provinces of Hsi @-@ k &apos;ang and Szechwan and is preparing to make all of western China a British colony .
Others such as French and American imperialism are also competing to divide up China &apos;s territory .
Waging a violent imperialist war , they wish to divide anew their market in China ! &apos;
The loathsome imperialist bourgeoisie is the common enemy of the proletariat and toiling masses of the world .
In China , they ally with the Kuomintangthe loathsome White terrorand arm over 1 million Kuomintang troops with guns , cannons , airplanes , and poison gas bombs at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars to attack China &apos;s revolutionary base and its soviet areas , attempting to extinguish its revolutionary movement with bloody massacres .
They wish to turn China completely into an imperialist colony in order to maintain , their control and to continue .their exploitation and enslavement of their domestic proletariat .
This is the fifth time that the Kuomintang government , with the aid of imperialism , has launched large @-@ scale attacks on China &apos;s soviet areas .
The Provisional Central Government of the Soviet Republic of China declares to the proletariat and toiling masses of the whole world : The Provisional Central Government of the Soviet Republic of China is the representative of the oppressed people of the entire China ,
The Soviet Republic of China was consolidated and developed in the anti @-@ imperialist war in the past ; now it will deal a fatal blow to the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; of the soviet areas launched by imperialism through the Kuomintang .
It negates all secret treaties between the imperialist powers and China1s Kuomintang government .
It is in the process of appealing to , mobilizing , and arming the people of the entire China .
It will resist the imperialist attempt to divide China with the war of national revolution , fundamentally overthrow the imperialist control in China , and establish a soviet political power of the entire China , in order to preserve its independence and unity and its territorial integrity .
It is a staunch partner to the proletariat and toiling masses of the whole world in their struggle against imperialism .
Proletariat and toiling masses and all revolutionaries of the whole world !
On behalf of the oppressed people of China , the Provisional Central Government of the Soviet Republic of China appeals to you to line up with us and overthrow the common enemy of the workers , tolling masses , and all revolutionaries of the whole worldthe world imperialist bourgeoisie !
We request that you adopt all means to block the imperialist nations from sending guns and cannons , airplanes , and poison gas bombs to China and slaughtering the people of China .
We appeal to the soldiers of your nations to resist imperialist aggression of colonies and refuse to slaughter China &apos;s masses in the interest of the imperialist bourgeoisie !
The proletariat and oppressed nations of the whole world , unite *
Resist imperialist wars !
Resist imperialist division of China !
Down with world imperialism !

ON THE WAYS AND MEANS TO SELL BOMDS
Directive of the Central People &apos;s Committee , 28 August 1933
&#91; Text &#93; Three million yuan of economic construction bonds have begun to be issued in the various areas in Jui @-@ chin .
According to the most recent experiences of Jui @-@ ehin , though Yun @-@ chi District and other areas adopted the correct method and made a great achievement , several other districts committed grave errors .
The main manifestation was that the district soviet presidium did not closely tackle bond selling and place it on its daily agenda for discussion and inspection , but considered it the function of the finance department .
It did not activate the mass organizations of the district level for unanimous mobilization .
As a result , the extremely serious situation of equal distribution appeared in many townships .
Without going through the discussion and recognition by the labor unions , poor peasants &apos; leagues , womenTs delegates1 association , and other mass organizations , without making reports at the township soviet delegates1 meeting , and without holding mass meetings to explain clearly the significance of the bonds , the bonds were issued to the township soviet , which , in turn , divided them evenly among the township delegates , who , in turn , divided them evenly among the masses .
Whether the masses understood or not , the bonds were evenly divided .
Some individual areas forced the middle peasants to buy bonds .
If they refused , they were called rich peasants .
Consequently , the masses in many areas were dissatisfied , and the sale of bonds was hampered .
However , it was entirely different in Yun @-@ chi District .
Because the Yun @-@ chi District soviet adopted the correct method of mobilization toward the townships and gave detailed explanations to the cadres of the township level , and the cadres , in turn , propagandized to the masses , it made a great achievement .
The district pledged to sell 40,700 yuan of bonds .
In less than 3 weeks , it had sold 25,500 yuan &apos;s worth of bonds .
Yang @-@ ch &apos;i township was the best .
It had sold all 4,600 yuan of bonds undertaken by it .
The glorious examples of Yun @-@ chi District and Yang @-@ ch &apos;i township are worthy of emulation by all the soviet areas .
For the satisfactory result of bond selling this time , the Central Government specifies the following points on the method of mobilization .
The governments of all levels must implement them completely .
The provincial soviet must give close attention to the work of bond issuance in the province and discuss , motivate , and inspect it .
It must gather the experiences of bond selling in the county where it is located and compile the good and bad examples of the mobilization into a document for the guidance of all the counties in the province .
The county soviet must give close attention to the work of bond issuance in the county and discuss , motivate , and inspect it .
It must gather the experiences of bond selling in .
the several counties near the county soviet and compile the good and bad examples into a document for the guidance of the districts .
The county soviet must , for the purpose of selling bonds , summon all the district chairmen and finance department chiefs for a meeting .
Even in counties where the bonds have not been received , such meetings must be called , so that the districts will embark upon the mobilization work without delay .
They must not wait until the bonds have arrived before holding a meeting and discussing .
After the bonds have been issued , they must again call a meeting of the district chairmen to inspect the work and rectify the errors .
The district soviet is the pivot to sell bonds and mobilize the masses .
It must call a meeting of the township soviet chairmen , poor peasants &apos; league chairmen , and the responsible persons of other mass organizations and explain to them in detail the significance of bond issuance and the method of mobilizing the masses .
Meanwhile , it must send men to the various townships and help the township Soviets call meetings of township delegates , poor peasants &apos; leagues , labor unions , and other mass organizations and make detailed explanations to them .
Village and hamlet mass meetings must be held through the cadres of the township level and the significance of the economic construction bonds explained in detail to the masses .
If the masses cannot understand after one meeting , another meeting must be held again .
When necessary , there may be a third meeting in areas where it is required .
The masses must be made to understand that buying bonds is in their own interest and for the victory of the war , so that they will eagerly buy them .
The government presidiums of all levels and the township soviet chairmen must strictly prevent the error of even distribution .
They must understand that even distribution is thorough bureaucraticism and an extremely erroneous method which will block the sale of bonds .
On the other &apos; : .hand , it will make it easy for the counterrevolutionaries to create rumors and deceive the people ; on the other hand , it will not arouse the revolutionary fervor of the worker @-@ peasant masses .
If even distribution is again discovered in the future , the higher level government must rectify it immediately .
If the error is not corrected after rectification , punishment must be dealt out .
Prohibition of even distribution is for the.purpose pf encouraging the masses to buy bonds voluntarily .
The names of those who buy more bonds and the amounts bought by them must be posted at the gate of the township soviet to serve as models , .
But absolutely no one must be forced to buy bonds , If a person refuses to buy , the representatives of the township soviet and women &apos;s delegates &apos; association , and the members of the labor union and poor peasants &apos; league must persuade and encourage him to buy bonds .
Those who have bought bonds may be asked to persuade those who have not .
Those who have bought more bonds in a village may be organized into a propaganda team to promote the sale of bonds .
Concerning propaganda work , the Central Government has already made an announcement .
Upon receipt of the announcement , the township government must immediately post it in the villages and hamlets .
The Central Government has also issued a propaganda outline on the economic construction bonds .
The work personnel and propaganda teams of the district and township Soviets must follow the articles in the outline and perform propaganda and encouragement work toward the masses .
7 The masses may pay for the bonds in cash or grain .
The district soviet will set the price of grain according to the local market value and notify the townships .
The district Soviets must guide the townships to form bond selling competition agreements .
Besides the figures , the agreement must provide that no bureaucraticist method , such as coercive distribution , is allowed .
The time limit must not be set too short ( naturally nor too long either ) , because it will make full mobilization impossible .
Attention must be given to all the eight points above .
The provincial and county Soviets must send men to the counties and districts to inspect and determine whether they are implementing fully this directive of the Central Government .
The county Soviets must make a simple summary of the district in their own counties which was most successful in selling bonds and mail it to &quot; RED CHINA &quot; for publication , in order to encourage all the soviet areas .
It is so ordered .

CENTRAL GOVERNMENT DIRECTIVE ON RECTIFYING THE FINANCE MINISTRY 25 August 1933
&#91; Text &#93; At a time when the Red Army is victorious , the soviet areas are expanding , and the revolutionary movement is vigorously progressing , the principle of the soviet financial policy must be : ( 1 ) Place the burden on the exploiting class in both soviet and White areas , mainly by imposing fines on the landlords , assessing donations from the rich peasants , and levying appropriate taxes from the merchants , provided such taxes do not damage the economic growth of the soviet areas .
( 2 ) Vigorously promote economic construction and , by developing the national economy , breaking down the enemy blockade , and restricting exploitation by the merchants , increase the revenue of the soviet .
( 3 ) Rely on the revolutionary fervor of the laboring peasant masses to collect suitable land taxes for the treasury of the state .
These constitute the fundamental principle of the soviet financial policy .
Under this principle , the soviet financial organ must , by revolutionary means , sound organization , and careful planning , expand the revenue and make it compatible with the development of the revolutionary war .
All conservative concepts and disorderly conditions apart from the political tasks are extremely detrimental .
So far , the work of the soviet financial organ , under the supervision of the People &apos;s Committee , has shown , considerable achievements in supplying the war needs and building an accounting system , but it has not adhered to the correct policy in regard to the principle of the financial policy ; Instead of devoting the maximum effort to raise funds from the exploiters and .
increase revenue by developing the national economy , it has concentrated on tax revenues and paper currency bonds .
Meanwhile , its assessment of the development of the revolution is inadequate , resulting in a lack of financial planning .
This constitutes a hindrance to large @-@ scale financial administration .
In leadership pattern , if , instead of relying on the urban and rural Soviets and the worker @-@ peasant mass organizations and mobilizing the broad masses through them in fund raising , , one depends on the small number of work personnel of the district level and above , the task cannot
be completely fulfilled , Such bureaucratic leadership pattern exists to a large extent in the soviet financial organ .
On the issue of cadres , attention is not given to training and promoting large groups of financial administration work personnel , nor to criticizing and weeding out some of the corrupt and.decadent elements .
All these are the result of failing to implement the correct class line and of making opportunist assessments of the revolutionary situation , and Comrade Teng Tzu @-@ hui &#91; 6772 1311 1863 &#93; , people &apos;s finance commissioner , must be mainly responsible .
The People &apos;s Committee feels that this situation must not be allowed to continue ; it commands the new chief of the people &apos;s finance department , Comrade Lin Po @-@ ch &apos;u &#91; 2651 0130 3255 &#93; , to rectify it fundamentally .
Self @-@ criticism in the entire financial system must be launched in order to rectify the erroneous understanding of the financial policy , formulate financial plans compatible with the development of the war , change the leadership pattern . , promote and train large groups o financial work personnel , and eliminate the partial corruption and decadence in the financial system , so that the entire soviet financial system will rapidly become sound and the soviet financial administration will become compatible with the development of the revolution , furnishing the full financial condition to the revolutionary war and thoroughly smashing the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; of the imperialist Kuomintang .
It is so ordered .

A Great Success
The land investigation movement , under the appeal of the Party and the Central Government , has been extensively launched .
If the movement in the past was considered as an initial stage only , then the work in the 1 month of July , after the eight @-@ county land investigation mass meeting in June , surpassed the achievement of more than half year since last winter .
Generally speaking , in the eight counties included in the mass meeting , the movement has reached a new stage and become an extensive mass movement .
The achievements of Jui @-@ chin and Po @-@ sheng were the greatest , uncovering a total of two thousand and several hundred landlords and rich peasants .
Initial achievements were made in the counties of Sheng @-@ li , Yu @-@ tu , Hui @-@ ch &apos;ang , T &apos;ing @-@ tung , Ch &apos;ang @-@ t &apos;ing , Shih @-@ ch * eng , and Ning @-@ hua .
In all the districts and townships where achievements were made , extensive mass struggles have started .
In soviet work and party work , there was much stagnation in the past , but now the work has become lively .
Many of the undesirable elements in the soviet were purged , and the counterrevolutionaries hidden in the rural villages encountered severe suppression .
In other words , the remnant feudal forces suffered a tragic defeat at the hands of the broad masses .
On this foundation , all kinds of work developed even more .
In areas where the land investigation movement had made achievements , great successes were also made in the expansion of the Red Array and the local militia , the sale of economic construction bonds , the development of the cooperative , fall harvesting and fall plowing , the launching of labor mutual aid associations , and such cultural undertakings as clubs , night schools , and elementary schools .
All items of work became more successful .
On the foundation of mass activeness , large groups of positive elements made themselves into cadres for all types of work , and many among the workers and peasants joined the party and enlisted in soviet work .
The best example was Jen @-@ t &apos;ien District in Jui @-@ chin .
With the help of the work group of the Central Government , Jen @-@ t &apos;ien District , in its land investigation movement , activated the masses of the entire district in 55 days , thoroughly eliminated the feudal remnants , uncovered over 300 landlords and rich
peasants , executed by shooting 12 counterrevolutionaries known as &quot; big tigers &quot; by the people , and suppressed counterrevolutionary activities .
Certain elements among the soviet work personnel committing serious errors were accused at mass meetings , and certain class deviationists infiltrating the soviet were purged .
Some 27,000 tan of land were ascertained in the entire district , and the more than 20,000 toiling masses received an additional 1 tan 2 ton of land per capita .
Large quantities of money and things belonging to the rich gentry and landlords were distributed to the masses .
Due to the unprecedented height of mass positivity , over 700 new Red Army soldiers , were recruited into the Jui @-@ chin Model Division in 55 days , without even one desertion .
The amount of grain saved and sold to the Red Army reached 1,900 tan or more , an accomplishment which no other district in the entire county could match .
Under the demand of the townships , the district undertook to sell 40,000 yuan of economic construction bonds ; 7,500 yuan were collected from landlord fines and rich peasant donations ; the district promised to continue to raise 10,000 yuan * Cooperatives developed rapidly , and cultural and educational constructions , such as clubs , literacy classes , and night schools , also increased .
The number of party members expanded ; the Party &apos;s leadership strengthened ; labor union work improved .
A new atmosphere emerged in the district .
From the backward district of Jui @-@ chin , it reversed itself in 55 days and became a first class district similar to Wu @-@ yang .
Why did Jen @-@ t &apos;ien District make such great achievements ?
We must point out that it was because they realized the importance of the task of land investigation and because they firmly followed the correct directives of the Central Bureau and the Central Government in their mobilization pattern , class line , and mass work and performed true Bolshevik work .
In regard to understanding the tasks , they understood the close links between the land investigation movement and the revolutionary war ; therefore , they performed the work conscientiously , closely tackled the leadership of the movement , and arranged the work of the local area with plans .
In regard to the mobilization pattern , they tightly tackled the work of the seven townships which were most , or relatively , backward among the 11 townships in the district , activated the party , the league , the township soviet , the labor union , the poor peasants &apos; league , and other mass organizations of the seven townships , and mobilized the broad masses through them .
In regard to the class line , they firmly followed the strategy of relying on the farm laborers and poor peasants and allying with the middle peasants , and extensively developed the poor peasants &apos; league .
They explained that land investigation was not land division and that class investigation did not include the middle peasants , poor peasants , and farm laborers .
Their work on &quot; discussing the classes &quot; was adequately performed .
When the landlords and rich peasants of 0 @-@ feng township frightened the middle peasants and caused alarm in some of them , our comrades held individual conversations with several middle peasants who spread our ideas to other middle peasants .
The middle peasants of 0 @-@ feng township immediately settled down and actively supported the land investigation policy of the soviet .
Instead of continuing to be defrauded by the landlords and rich peasants , they joined the poor peasants and workers and attacked the landlords and rich peasants together .
The comrades of Jen @-@ t &apos;ien District did make mistakes on the classification of several
households , but they remedied them promptly .
In regard to guiding the mass struggles , they first made extensive propaganda .
Instead of holding meetings of the entire district and township , they held village and hamlet meetings , contacted broader masses , and propagandized to and encouraged them many times .
Therefore , the masses of the entire district understood that land and class investigations were their responsibilities and in their interest .
Next , they investigated the class components and activated many people to perform the task .
Material evidence on the various components was carefully collected and shown to the masses ; therefore , there was no incident of dissatisfaction among the masses .
Subsequently , through the class classifications , the land investigation committee first made an analysis and decision which were handed to the poor peasants &apos; organization for discussion and passage and then submitted to the district soviet for approval .
Thereafter , they proceeded to the village where the party whose property was to be confiscated resided and called a village mass meeting .
Only after a clear explanation of the case and the raising of hands to show support was the property confiscated .
In regard to the distribution of money and things and land , the work personnel all understood that they , themselves , must serve as the models and refrain from taking anything .
They distributed everything to the masses , a larger amount to the village where the property was found and a smaller amount to other villages , and won the satisfaction of the masses .
Land was also promptly divided .
The .
situation of prolonged delays in other areas was not found in Jen @-@ trien district .
Therefore , the masses were rapidly activated .
The way they attacked the backward big villages was also correct .
They were not afraid of the big villages , but nor did they use brute force .
What they did was to concentrate their forces , make more propaganda , try to win over the local positive elements , rallying and educating them , and activate the remainder of the masses through them .
They were very patient in performing such village work which appeared to be slow but actually very fast .
In 55 days , they activated all the backward big villages in the district and eliminated their backwardness within a short time .
When they were unable to enter a village in Po @-@ k &apos;eng township because of the two well @-@ known &quot; big tigers &quot; there , they adopted a different means .
The two rascals were arrested and tried in the local mobile court and , with the enthusiastic support of the masses , executed by shooting .
The mass struggle in this village spread like wildfire .
They held 10 mass trial meetings and mobile court meetings , all via a very extensive mass line .
Most of the people of the township attended while all the villages of other townships sent delegates , 10 or more from the small townships , and 40 or 50 from the large townships .
Therefore , the results of each public trial and judgment were immediately spread to all the townships and villages of the district .
Besides realizing the justice of punishing or killing the culprit , the masses of all the townships and villages immediately thought of similar evil elements in their own areas who also should be punished .
The land investigation movement of Jen @-@ t &apos;ien District is truly a model for the entire soviet area !
Chiu @-@ pao District of Jui @-@ chin also was very successful .
They first closely tackled three townships , summoned the members of their land investigation committees to the district soviet for a 3 @-@ day training class , and explained the mobilization method , the class line , and the means to win the masses .
On the issue of distributing the confiscated
property , they created a good method .
When a landlord &apos;s household was to be confiscated , they would ask the masses of the village and the household to gather together , elect a confiscation distribution committee ^ proceed with the confiscation under the supervision of the masses , pile the things confiscated in an open space , and distribute them to those entitled with the approval of the masses .
The edibles were handled in a different manner .
They slaughtered hogs and cooked rice for a big meal for the masses .
This method produced a great effect in Chiu @-@ pao District .
Their confiscation distribution committee was not a regular organization , but a temporary one , thus creating a closer association with the masses .
( As for the distribution of confiscated land , it was still handled by the regular land committee ) .
The confiscated things were not taken to the township soviet , nor did they wait until several households were confiscated before distribution ; therefore , delay and theft were avoided .
Chiu @-@ pao District was just as correct on other lines and methods ; therefore , they could activate the broad masses for class investigation .
They were so successful that no landlord or rich peasant appeared at the township soviet to object to the classification , which was completely contrary to the condition of land investigation in the past .
In the past , there were always many investigated landlords and rich peasants who appeared at the soviet to object , claiming that the classification was wrong .
Not just themselves , but even the responsible persons of the township representing the poor peasants &apos; organization would come forward and argue for them .
This time , naturally , it was not because the landlords and rich peasants did not want to object , but they could not do so .
No one of their clan or among their relatives supported them .
They were incapacitated , and it was impossible for them to object .
It showed that Chiu @-@ pao District performed adequate work in activating the masses , for otherwise they could not have attained this stage .
All such glorious exemplary instances ( not scarce in other areas ) constituted a Bolshevik response to the appeal of the Party and the Central Government and proved the absolute accuracy of the directives of the Central Bureau and the Central Government .
Anywhere where such directives were completely implemented , great successes were immediately made .
Anywhere where they were violated or overlooked , errors were committed in the work , and little or no achievement was made .
Let me prove this point by the facts .
Some Areas Relinquished the Leadership of the Land Investigation Movement .
In regard to the fighting task of the land investigation movement , after the promulgation of the decision of the Central Bureau , the issuance of the directive of the Central Government , and the mass meeting of the eight counties , the development of the movement did not reach all areas .
The land investigation achievement of the entire province of Fukien , for instance , was only equivalent to that of the county of Po @-@ sheng ; the achievement of Sheng @-@ li , Yu- ^ tu , Hui @-@ ch &apos;ang , or Shih @-@ ehfeng could only match that of the best one or two districts of Jui @-@ chin .
The land investigation committees
of many areas had not even held one meeting ?
and even the county land investigation committees of several counties failed to tackle the land investigation work of the county ( Hui ~ chTang , Yu @-@ tu ?
Shih @-@ ch &apos;eng , and Ning @-@ hua ) .
In many districts and townships land investigation committees , the district and township chairmen did not serve as the committee chairmen .
On grounds of being busy in other matters , they relinquished the task of land investigation .
In regard to Party leadership of land investigation , in all areas where land investigation was successful , the effect of the Party &apos;s firm leadership was clearly demonstrated , and the majority of the Party membership masses , under the guidance of the Party branch and district committee , performed much courageous Bolshevik fighting work .
On the other hand , wherever land investigation achieved little , or nothing , the Party unit &apos;s neglect of the movement was apparent .
Almost 2 months after the promulgation of the land investigation decision of the Central Bureau , the Hui @-@ ch &apos;ang county committee , for instance , never once discussed land investigation work .
Not until the end of July did they hold a meeting on the matter .
In one period , the Pu @-@ hsiao district committee paid no attention to the land investigation movement at all .
Though the urban committee of Jui @-@ chin held one meeting for land investigation , it did not activate the suburban branch committees to give attention to the leadership of land investigation , and none of the branches ever held a meeting for the movement .
In other areas , such as the county committees of Yu @-@ tu , Sheng @-@ li , Shih @-@ ch &apos;eng , and Ning @-@ hua and many district committees , they also failed to pay close attention to the work of land investigation .
The party and the Central Government said : &quot; The land investigation movement has become an effective means to activate the masses for intensive rural class struggle , thoroughly solve the land issue , and eliminate feudalism or semi @-@ feudalism &quot; ( decision of the Central Bureau ) ; &quot; the land investigation movement is an urgent task of the Soviets of all areas &quot; ( directive of the Central Government ) ; &quot; the land investigation movement is the most important link in the current work &quot; ( summary of the eight @-@ county mass meeting ) .
Meanwhile , many of our comrades said : &quot; Too busy ; no time to look after the land investigation movement . &quot; The Party resolution stated : &quot; The superficial attitude of handling the land investigation movement with bureaucraticism and formalism is most detrimental . &quot; Yet these comrades still handled the land investigation with bureaucraticism .
Some Areas Actually Capitulated to the Rich Peasants ,
In areas where the land investigation was launched , there still appeared many individual serious errors .
One often came across individual comrades in the local Party unit or soviet who , in face of the violent class struggle of the land investigation movement , indicated their opportunist vacillations .
This was mainly because , during the vigorous development of the movement , they were unable to abandon their clan or local relationships but sheltered the landlords and rich peasants of their own clan or village .
Or they erroneously analyzed the class components , considering the ~ lanoTords a &quot; s ~ rich peasants and the rich peasants as middle peasants .
Some work comrades of the judicial department , by their extreme negligence , accepted the false accusations of the positive elements in the land investigation by the landlords and rich peasants in the name of the people .
In another aspect ,
some of our security bureau and judicial department comrades failed to keep pace with the development of the mass class investigation struggle and actively suppress the counterrevolution , and they even turned dovn the demands of the masses to arrest and execute the landlord and rich peasant elements who resisted the land investigation .
The judicial department of Jui @-@ chin was an example of making all those mistakes .
The Tendency to Encroach Upon the Middle Peasants Is the Most Serious Danger .
The &quot; leftwing &quot; opportunist tendency , in the July land investigation , appeared in many areas .
Here , the tendency to encroach upon the middle peasants must be emphatically pointed out .
The Central Bureau clearly indicated in its resolution : &quot; Special attention must be given to the alliance with the middle peasant masses .
They are the broadest basic masses in the soviet village after the revolution ; therefore , we must win their approval and support in all our measures and strategies .
Every decision made by a poor peasant organization or the soviet must acquire the support of the middle peasant masses at the village or hamlet mass meetings , and all appeals of the middle peasant masses must be heeded .
Any attempt to encroach upon their interest must be severely discouraged . &quot; It was pointed out at the conclusion of the eight @-@ county mass meeting : &quot; The goal of land investigation is class investigation , not redivision of land . , ..
Allying with the middle peasants must start from not encroaching upon their interest .. , At the beginning of the land investigation we must generally propagandize the soviet policy of allying with the middle peasants and guard against encroaching upon their interest .
In the process of land investigation , we must carefully decide on the borderline cases between the middle and rich peasants and avoid -mistakes . &quot; However , the comrades of many areas did not pay attention to such instructions .
In the land investigation of the Jui ^ -chin urban area , they began the investigation by the households and farms .
Some middle peasants were so alarmed that they came to the soviet and asked to have their classification changed into poor peasants .
They said : &quot; It is very dangerous to be a middle peasant , because it is only one step removed from the rich peasant .
A poor peasant will be further removed from the rich peasant . &quot; Do such painful appeals not deserve our attention ?
The comrades of Yang @-@ ku township , Huang ^ po District , announced to the masses : &quot; Class investigation is only the investigation of the middle peasants , rich peasants , and landlords . &quot; The comrades of Tfao ^ ching District put down stakes and forced the investigation , and some of the middle peasants were so terrified that they fled into the mountains to hide .
Some townships in Fo @-@ sheng county also put down stakes and made a general investigation , and the middle peasants there were similarly terrified .
It was stated at the eighth @-@ county mass meeting that &quot; the idea that land investigation requires staking is not correct , &quot; Nevertheless , the comrades paid no attention .
General investigation by staking happened in every county .
It was an unusually serious situation .
They confused land investigation and land division .
True , land division would require staking , but the land figures must first be clarified before division .
If the method of staking was used in the land investigation movement , it would confuse the rural struggle goal .
We pointed out in the past ; &quot; Land investigation and land division must be strictly distinguished .
Such distinction is not only for the purpose of stabilizing the peasants &apos; land ownership so that they will not be alarmed over the uncertainty of land division , but also for the victory of the class investigation struggle .
We -must concentrate our forces , especially by allying with the middle peasants , to handle the resistance of the landlords and rich peasants .
At this time , there must not be any confusion or disturbance within the peasants1 own ranks &quot; ( conclusion of the eight- ^ county mass meeting ) .
It was one of our most important strategies in guiding the land investigation struggle ; yet it was neglected by many comrades .
Such neglect cannot be tolerated for another moment .
In regard to those who , after being given guidance , continue with such mistakes , the local higher level soviet must punish them severely .
Ideological struggles must be launched inside the Party and the league , and any Party or league member , in his thinking or action , encroaching upon the interest of the middle peasants and violating the strategy of allying with them , must be opposed .
In regard to the mistakes already made , the soviet personnel must openly admit their mistakes to the local middle peasant masses and return the land and property to the wronged parties .
Last year , Hsing @-@ kuo returned land to many middle peasants and won the satisfaction of the middle peasant masses , It was a valuable lesson .
The Closed @-@ door @-@ ism of the Poor Peasants * League and the Neglect of the Leadership Effect of the Farm Laborers Are Wrong ,
&quot; The poor peasant masses are the props of the Party , the proletariat in the rural village , and the staunch supporters of the land revolution . &quot; &quot; Relying on the poor peasants &quot; is one of our important strategies in the land investigation movement and all land struggles , and the poor peasants &apos; league is an organization with a great effect in the land investigation movement .
The eight @-@ county poor peasants &apos; league delegates mass meeting already pointed out that the closed @-@ door tendency of the poor peasants1 league was wrong , that the sponsor system must be abolished and the gates opened wide to the poor peasant workers , and that all poor peasant workers , men and women , old and young , could join .
But many places still followed the old method without change and still required sponsoring .
In T &apos;ao @-@ ching District , Jui @-@ chin , when the poor peasant masses not belonging to the league came to its meeting , the responsible persons refused them admittance .
In Chu @-@ chai @-@ chi District , Po @-@ sheng , not one new member was admitted to the poor peasants &apos; league in the entire month of July .
In all the districts and townships where land investigation was successful , the poor peasants &apos; league developed extensively , while in all the districts and townships with little or no success , the one manifestation was the closed @-@ door situation of the poor peasants &apos; league .
Similarly , many comrades failed to recognize the great leadership effect of the farm laborers in the land investigation movement .
The party resolution stated : &quot; The farm laborer masses are the rural brothers of the urban proletariat and the vanguard of the land revolution ; therefore ; the work personnel of the Soviets must establish a
close connection with the labor union , develop and organize the positivity of the worker masses through it , and turn them into the vanguard of the land investigation movement . &quot; Not many of our comrades followed this instruction .
Here , the main means is to make the rural workers join the poor peasants &apos; league and form separate workers * cells within it .
Through such workers &apos; cells , the positive elements among the poor peasants are rallied to develop the poor peasantsr league and promote the progress of the land investigation movement .
The experiences of Shan ^ ho township , Huang @-@ po District , are valuable .
When our comrades failed twice to call a poor peasantsT league meeting , they held a joint mass meeting of the agricultural and handicraft labor unions and activated several dozen workers .
Each worker brought a poor peasant to the poor peasants1 league .
The next day , a poor peasants &apos; league meeting was held and the land investigation movement was launched in Shan @-@ ho township .
This experience must be introduced in all the rural villages .
The higher level leading organ of the labor union must render positive guidance to the lower level labor union and consider land investigation one of the important tasks of the labor union .
Incorrect Concepts of the Rich Peasant Issue .
Our general strategy in the rural struggle is to rely on the poor peasants , firmly ally with the middle peasants , make the farm .laborers produce a vanguard effect , and rally all revolutionary forces , in order to eliminate the landlord class and resist the rich peasants .
On the rich peasant issue , the party has stated correctly : &quot; The landlords and rich peasants must be clearly distinguished .
In the struggle to eliminate ruthlessly the landlord remnants , there must not be any attempt to eliminate the rich peasants . &quot; In the land investigation in July , though there was no theory openly advocating the elimination of the rich peasants , instances of considering them as landlords and con.fiscating all their assets were discovered in many areas .
The source of the.error was a result of obliterating the labor force of the rich peasants .
When we said that &quot; those who perform no labor , or only incidental labor , but practice exploitation , such as collecting land rent , are landlords , &quot; some areas considered those who used considerable number of labor elements as &quot; performing only incidental labor &quot; and classified them as landlords .
Other areas considered the rich peasants who also exploited by high interest loans as &quot; usurers &quot; and handled them according to the method of &quot; eliminating usurers . &quot; There were also areas which reckoned old accounts , going back a certain number of years before the revolution .
If a person hired permanent help 5 or 6 years , or even .
10 or more years , before the revolution , he was considered a rich peasant , Or , the wellto @-@ do middle peasants who once hired permanent help for 1 or 2 years but had not done so since then were classified as rich peasants .
The even more serious instances occurred in a certain area in Hsing @-@ kuo .
They distinguished the landlords and rich peasants by the number of exploitations .
Those guilty of three kinds of exploitations were called landlords , and those guilty of two kinds , rich peasants .
For instance , if a peasant hired permanent help , collected rent , and lent out money , he was considered a landlord regardless
of the number of family members who labored .
Then , the problem of &quot; reactionary rich peasants &quot; was very confused in many areas .
One rich peasant in Wu @-@ yang District who was also a merchant had 17 mouths to feed in the family .
Because one member of his family joined the AB League 2 years ago and was killed , the comrades there insisted on confiscating his entire family assets .
Similar instances were many in other areas .
In regard to the rich peasants who were not guilty of very serious counterrevolutionary conduct before the uprising , such as &quot; collecting 30 percent grain as rent &quot; ( Jui @-@ chin ) , and who did not perform any counterrevolutionary activity in the several years since the uprising , the majority of the masses did not want to punish them ; yet some of our comrades insisted on confiscating their assets .
Actually , in regard to this kind of people we must use different strategies for consolidated areas and uncosolidated outlying areas .
In the outlying areas , doubtlessly we must adopt a strict method and suppress all counterrevolutionary elements , including the rich peasants .
In central areas , we must decide according to the situation .
In regard to those who indulged in serious conterrevolutionary conduct before the uprising , or who continued in their counterrevolutionary activities after the uprising , naturally we must confiscate their assets , but otherwise we must not do so .
For some households , we should confiscate only the assets belonging to the guilty party himself and those directly connected with his counterrevolutionary conduct , and leave the assets of the rest of the family intact .
This is the only way to handle it correctly .
The Worker @-@ Peasant Procurators &apos; Department Failed To Discharge Its Duties and Made Mistakes .
Many of our comrades in the worker @-@ peasant procurators &apos; department did not realize that the land investigation movement was the best opportunity to launch the ideological struggle , resist bureaucraticism , oppose corruption , decadence , and negative slowdown , and expel the class deviationists from the soviet , and they were very inadequate in performing such work .
Many of them , in face of the violent class struggle , manifested their negative vacillation , bureaucraticism , and formalism .
The chief.of the Jui @-@ chin city soviet worker @-@ peasant procurators * section sheltered the chief of the city soviet judicial section who was guilty of grave corruption ( appropriating over 1,000 yuan of public funds ) .
The chief of Tu @-@ t &apos;ou District worker @-@ peasant procurators &apos; section failed to criticize or prosecute the district soviet chairman who neglected land investigation .
In some areas , the worker @-@ peasant procurators7 department followed another erroneous directions in its prosecution movement .
They considered love as decadence and taking things belonging to the landlords as corruption and prosecuted , or even tried in public , the culprits .
Some areas dismissed those making minor mistakes from their posts .
Instead of systematically launching self @-@ criticism and ideological struggle , which involved strenuous work , they resorted to punishment in their place .
Needless to say , those among the soviet work personnel committing long @-@ term and serious errors must be firmly purged , but dismissing and punishing those making lesser errors were excessive .
In regard to the class deviationists , generally only the classification was taken into consideration , not the work .
As long as their background was bad , regardless of their long struggle history , or their
correct implementation of the Party and soviet lines and policies in the past or at present , they were considered class deviationists and dismissed .
True , we must firmly purge the class deviationists .
Those with undesirable classifications and inferior work performances ( including landlords , rich peasants , negative slowdown , corruption , etc . ) must doubtlessly be purged , hut it would be excessive to handle the lesser ones likewise .
The Leadership Technique of the Land Investigation Struggle .
If we understand the task and the line , but do not have the Bolshevik technique of leading the mass struggle , the land investigation movement still cannot develop .
At the beginning of this article we discussed the many good examples of leading the struggle in Jen @-@ t &apos;ien District and other areas , but in many other areas , numerous mistakes were made on this point .
In some areas , they did not know how to employ all kinds of means to activate the struggle in the backward big villages where the landlords and rich peasants corgregated .
In some big villages , only by first arresting the evil gentry and landlord eleroents ?
known to the masses as &quot; big tigers , &quot; before the struggle could be launched , but our comrades failed to do so .
In regard to distributing the confiscated goods to activate a mass struggle , which is an excellent method , many areas did not resort to it .
In Wa @-@ tzu township , T &apos;ao @-@ ching District , Jui @-@ chin , the confiscated things were only distributed to the land investigation cadres and poor peasants &apos; league members , not to anyone else , on ground that those who were not positive were not entitled .
Some areas were very slow in distributing the confiscated things , holding them for as long as a month or more .
The distribution of confiscated land was even slower .
The comrades of many areas did not know that they must produce a nucleus leadership effect in the mass organizations and villages by mobilizing the departments of the soviet , the mass organizations , and the Party and league members .
When the work could not be started , they would say that there was nothing one could do in this area anyway .
In some areas , after the class investigation mass struggle had been started and many people came to report on the landlords and rich peasants and request investigation and confiscation , our comrades were unable to utilize the mass fervor , lead the struggle , and spread the class investigation work to the various villages .
In some areas , after some investigation , the struggle fervor of the masses could not continue to rise and a situation of stagnation appeared .
Our comrades were unable to stimulate the masses by all kinds of means in order to raise their enthusiasm until all feudal remnants were eliminated .
In other areas , after the land investigation movement , when the struggle fervor of the masses flourished , our comrades were unable to organize and shift the fervor to another front .
For instance , after the people received things or land , they should have , at the mass meetings or other favorable occasions , encouraged them to enlist in the Red Army , sell bonds , join the cooperative , devote their effort to fall harvesting and fall plowing , establish clubs and literacy classes , or develop night and elementary schools .
They missed the best opportunities .
When the higher level ordered such work to be done , they would then begin to propagandize and encourage .
Such tailism leadership , dropping behind the struggle fervor of the masses , is most detrimental to revolutionary work . .. _ .. ---
In another aspect , there was , in many areas , the undesirable situation of a few persons working with brute force .
We once stressed that we must oppose the indifference of the majority of the masses and the commandist work pattern , and that only by patient and arduous work to activate the masses and win them before we could get the support of the majority and attain the goal of eliminating the feudal remnants .
Such mass work is the only safeguard to implementing the class line .
At the beginning of the land investigation movement , we must propagandize extensively in all the villages , explaining to the masses that the land investigation movement was necessary , that land investigation was not land division , and that class investigation was not an investigation of the middle peasant , poor peasant , and farn laborer classes , and clarifying to them especially the distinctions among the landlords , rich peasants , and middle peasants .
Village mass meetings must be held more than once , especially in the backward villages .
Our propaganda must reach everyone of the revolutionary masses .
To attain this goal , we must first explain clearly at the township soviet delegates meetings , labor unions , poor peasants &apos; leagues , women laborers * and farm women delegates * meetings , and other mass organizations , and to all the positive elements , and propagandize through them to the masses .
Class investigation must not be performed by only a few individuals , but by the majority .
In regard to class classification , , it must be passed not only at the poor peasants &apos; league , the township soviet , and the district soviet , but also at the mass meetings of the village and hamlet of the party whose assets are to be confiscated , and the confiscation can only be carried out with the approval of the masses .
When distributing things to the masses of the particular village and hamlet , it must be to the satisfaction of such masses .
All these measures are for the purpose of winning the majority of the masses .
The work personnel of the Party and the soviet must never forget the majority of the masses in any task at any time .
We must turn toward the masses , which means the majority of the masses .
Our work must penetrate the masses , which means penetrating the masses of the large and small villages , large and small towns .
We must severely oppose the erroneous means of closed ^ door &apos; -ism and commandisra with only a few individuals performing the work .
Yet , our comrades in many areas did not do so .
In many districts and townships in Jui @-@ chin , they never even once discussed the classes ( never analyzed the distinctions among landlords , rich peasants , and middle peasants ) to the masses .
In many areas in Jui @-@ chin and other counties , they started investigating without propaganda .
As a result , the landlords and rich peasants created rumors and deceived the middle peasants .
They claimed that there were many landowners and rich peasants in the township or that several hundred landlords and rich peasants were to be investigated ( Jui @-@ chin ) ; yet our comrades failed to use the means of &quot; discussing classes &quot; to break down the rumor .
A landlord in Kuang @-@ ch &apos;ang said : &quot; The land investigation movement means that the Central Government wants the debtors to repay their debts to the Central ; &quot; yet our comrades did not immediately expose such falsehood .
In several townships in TTao- ^ ching District , besides not propagandizing , class investigation was performed only by the several members of the land investi &apos; -gation committee , and class classification did not go through the mass
meetings , nor the poor peasants * league .
They said : &quot; The masses are not reliable .
They donTt know how to analyze the classes .
To pass the class classifications at the mass meeting will lead to disputes .
It is more reliable for the land investigation committee to handle it , &quot; This theory is truly amazing !
In several areas , confiscation of the property of landlords was done at night , not during day time , on the sole ground that the landlord might run away .
In one area , for the mass meeting , they used the method of &quot; mass meeting of the entire district . &quot; Less than 200 people showed up .
Three .men lectured In turns from morning to afternoon , not permitting the masses to rest or eat , on the grounds that they might run away .
This barbarous method can be considered another amazing thing !
IX .
Launch the Struggle between the Two Lines , Overcome One &apos;s Own Errors ,
and Strive for the Complete Success of .the Land Investigation Movement .
Doubtlessly , land investigation has been launched extensively .
Nevertheless , when the movement is progressing , and when we have made a correct assessment of the achievements and laid a foundation for its development , we must be alert and give attention to the obstacles in the movement .
Only by launching the struggle between the two lines to eliminate such obstacles will we promote the faster progress of the movement .
Launching anti ~ rightwing ideological struggles and opposing under @-@ estimation of the serious significance of the movement , compromise with and capitulation to the landlords and rich peasants , and the tailist leadership of the mass struggle are the responsibilities of each and every communist party member .
Meanwhile , all the Party members must be alerted to the danger of encroaching upon the middle peasants ; we must &quot; severely hit any attempt to encroach upon the interest of the middle peasants , &quot; because this is an extremely serious danger which has clearly manifested itself in the current land investigation work .
The incorrect concepts concerning the rich peasants will also doubtlessly affect the middle peasants .
All the commandist ways of brute force are most harmful to the alliance with the middle peasants .
By sweeping aside all obstacles on the road of the land Investigation movement with the firepower of the struggle between the two lines , the movement will advance in big strides , and its complete success will be fully guaranteed .

SMASHING THE FIFTH TENCIRCLEMENT AND SUPPRESSION &apos; AND FULFILL SOVIET ECONOMIC CONSTRUCTION TASKS
Report at the Economic Construction Rally of the 17 Southern Counties , 12 August 1933
&#91; Text &#93; Comrades : This time we are holding two economic construction ralliesthe 17 southern counties and the 11 northern counties .
We have never before held a rally for economic construction .
Today is the first time .
The current situation is : The fourth enemy &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; has been completely smashed by us , and the fifth &quot; encirclement &quot; is imminent .
The great storm of world revolution and war is pressing in on us .
The imperialist world war and the war against the Soviet Union are under insane preparation .
Imperialism recklessly oppresses China .
Having occupied four and a half of China &apos;s provinces , Japan is extending its bandit war toward Inner Mongolia .
After the total failure of the fourth &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; the Kuomintang is in the process of preparing a fifth one .
The revolutionary struggles and revolutionary war of the whole of China are developing forcefully under a new situation .
That we hold an economic construction rally at this time indicates what we wish to discuss and the purpose of our economic construction .
This is the point which I wish to explain in my report today .
This report Is divided into two parts .
Smashing of the Fourth &quot; Encirclement and Suppression &quot; and the New Fifth &quot; Encirclement and Suppression &quot;
I will first discuss the victories won by us in smashing the fourth &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot;
We wish to say that :
First , it was a large destruction of enemy troops .
The fourth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; was completely smashed .
The Red Army in the central area , Hupeh @-@ Honan @-@ Anhwei , Szechwan , Hunan @-@ west Hupeh , Hunan @-@ Kiangsi , Hunan @-@ Hupeh @-@ Kiangsi , and Fukien @-@ Chekiang @-@ Kiangsi soviet
areas wiped out a total of over 15 divisions of enemy troops in the past year , a greater victory than the smashing of the enemy &apos;s third &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; The armed forces of the enemy suffered a most severe setback .
All the middle and lower echelon officers of the enemy army are in mortal fear of the Red Army and are afraid to fight it .
Meanwhile , the vacillation of the soldiers of the White army and their sympathy for the revolution continue to grow .
Second , it is the strengthening and expansion of the Red Army .
The Red Army has become an invincible ironclad force .
The change in its organization , the improvement in its military technique , and the stability in its politics have all made great progresses .
In regard to its expansion , it has doubled from the past .
We have built a large @-@ scale combat army .
Third , it is the consolidation of the soviet areas .
During the fourth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; the class awareness of the worker @-@ peasant masses and their fervor in supporting the revolutionary war were raised even higher .
The intensification of the land investigation movement and the development of the workers * struggles have constituted serious blows on the remnant feudal forces in the soviet areas .
The culture and education mass movement has made a further development .
A new situation has unfolded in the economic construction movement .
The work of the soviet has improved even more and its prestige in the masses has risen even higher .
The soviet banner is reflected in the minds and eyes of the toiling masses in the entire nation .
The fourth is the expansion of soviet territory .
This includes the establishment of the central area and the provinces of ? ukien and Kiangsi , and the opening of several hundred li of new soviet areas in Szechwan .
Comrade Ho Lung &#91; 6320 7893 &#93; of Hunan @-@ Hupeh @-@ Szechwan has developed a large soviet area there .
The fifth is the great development of the revolutionary movement in areas controlled by the Kuomintang .
As Japanese imperialism forcefully occupied four and one @-@ half provinces belonging to China and the Kuomintang surrendered to capitalism and formed a traitorous agreement with Japan , the movement of .the broad masses against imperialism and the Kuomintang has spread on a large scale .
As a result of the oppression and massacre practiced by the Kuomintang , the bankruptcy of agriculture , industry , and commerce , and the aggravated cruel exploitation of workers and peasants by the capitalists and landlords , the strikes of the workers , the struggles of the peasants , and the resistance of the calamity stricken masses against taxes and levies , and the rural riots and guerrilla warfare have greatly expanded .
Comrades , we have won great victories , but how were such victories won ?
I feel that you all know that they were won because of ( 1 ) the courage and skill of the Red Army , ( 2 ) the revolutionary positivity of the broad worker @-@ peasant masses in the soviet and White areas , and ( 3 ) the leadership of the communist party &apos;s correct line .
Only with these three important factors did we smash the enemy &apos;s fourth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; and win the great victories discussed above .
These victories constituted a tremendous blow to the imperialist Kuomintang .
On the one hand , the revolutionary strengths have increased even more , advancing powerfully like an iron torrent .
On the other hand , the counterrevolutionary strengths have weakened more than ever before .
Feeling the pressure of imminent destruction , the enemies have no choice but to prepare an attack of an even larger scale than before , attempting to salvage their dying control .
Therefore , the enemies are insanely planning their fifth &quot; encirclment and suppression11
To arrange for the &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; this time , the Kuomintang has to submit even further to imperialism .
After selling out Manchuria , Jehol , and North China , Chiang Kai @-@ shek entered into secret treaties containing many traitorous provisions with the imperialist countries of America , England , France , Italy and Germany , and borrowed large quantities of money and arms .
Moving the troops , training the recruits , and approaching the factional warlords ( but the conflicts and wars among the warlords are inevitable ) , he is actively preparing the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; of the soviet and the Red Army .
Smashing of the Fifth &quot; Encirclement and Suppression &quot; and the Soviet Economic Construction Tasks
Seize all favorable factors to smash the enemies &apos; fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot;
China &apos;s revolution is now at a critical point .
In other words , will imperialism destroy China ?
Or will the revolutionary war destroy the Kuomintang , expel imperialism , and turn the nation into a soviet China ?
The imperialist Kuomintang selected the path of destroying China .
They have already adopted the method of a fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; They wish to divide China up like a melon or place it under joint control by means of the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; turning China &apos;s millions into slaves of imperialism , into Indians and Koreans , and China itself into an imperialist colony .
This is a great danger .
It hangs over our head and threatens us .
Comrades , can we permit them to do so ?
No , we must fight for the way out through revolution .
Our way out is to subjugate the imperialist Kuomintang , sever China from its control , and make it into a new free and independent worker @-@ peasant @-@ soldier soviet republic .
The critical point is to thoroughly smash their fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; and strive for victory .
We must still rely on the Red Army , on the masses , and on the firm implementation of the communist party &apos;s line of attack .
Nevertheless ?
we must concentrate our effort to seize all factors even more favorable than ever before in order to smash the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; and win even greater victories .
To gain victory this time , we must perform much work .
We must vigorously expand the Red Army and train 200,000 new soldiers for the front line in 6 to 10 months in the central and the several soviet areas nearby , so that the Red Army groups on all fronts are even stronger and able to perform the task of hitting Chiang Kai ^ shek &apos;s several hundred thousand White troops .
We must launch an extensive and intensive land investigation movement and vigorously develop the rural class struggle , in order to thoroughly solve the land issue , eliminate the remnant feudal forces , and increase the eagerness and joy of the broad peasant masses in joining the revolutionary war , We must generally introduce the labor law , expand the struggles of the workers , and further raise the positivity of the worker masses toward the revolutionary war .
We -must , through the election movement this year , reelect the soviet of all levels , from the township to the central , so that the entire soviet political power will be strong like iron and able to shoulder the great mission of organizing and directing the revolutionary more successfully .
We must give attention to the work on the frontier and in the newly developed areas and make the revolutionary war progress rapidly toward the pivotal cities .
We must launch mass cultural movements and improve the cultural and political levels of the masses , so that the revolutionary war will gain an effective spiritual tool .
Besides the foregoing , there is yet another extremely important task which we wish , to stress in our present discussions--the work in the economic construction aspect .
We must vigorously launch the economic construction movement and consider economic construction one of the most fundamental factors to smash the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; &quot; &quot; an indispensable material factor in the revolutionary war .
The holding of the economic construction rally this time is for this purpose .
The great economic construction tasks are spread before us !
The intensive development of the revolutionary war makes it necessary for the soviet to mobilize the masses , immediately launch a movement on the economic front , and proceed with the required economic construction tasks .
Why ?
For winning the victory of the revolutionary war , for acquiring the material factors to guarantee the supplies of the Red Army , for improving the life of the masses in order to stimulate even higher their positivity in joining the revolutionary war , for organizing the broad masses on the economic front and educating them in order to gain new mass strengths for the war , for consolidating the worker @-@ peasant alliance by means of economic construction , stabilizing the soviet political power under the worker @-@ peasant dictatorship , reenforcing the proletarial leadership , and striving for the thorough victory of the entire revolutionary war , primarily the smashing of the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; the economic construction work has to be undertaken .
Each and every soviet work personnel must immediately realize this point .
In the past , some comrades
felt that , as the revolutionary war alone had kept them busy , how would they have the spare time to perform economic construction work ?
Anyone discussing economic construction was conderaened as rightwing .
Moreover , they also felt that it was impossible to undertake economic construction in the environment of the revolutionary war , that it must be postponed until the final victory of the war , that it could only be promoted in an evironment of peace and tranquillity , and that it was out of the question at the present time .
Comrades , are such opinions correct ?
No .
Those comrades making such statements failed to realize that if economic construction is not undertaken , there will be no complete assurance of the material factors of the war and we will be weary in a long @-@ term war .
The enemies are enforcing an economic blockade , and the unconscionable reactionary merchants are sabotaging our currency and commerce .
If we do not overcome such difficulties , will the revolutionary war not suffer a great damage ?
The blockade by the enemies and the manipulations by the unconscionable merchants have greatly hindered our trade with the outside .
The cost of salt is very high , and sometimes not even available .
Grain is cheap in the fall , but soars in the spring and summer .
Such conditions produce an immediate impact on the life of the workers and peasants and block the further improvement of their living standards .
Will this situation not affect the basic line of the worker @-@ peasant alliance ?
If the workers and peasants are dissatisfied with their life , will it not affect our effort to expand the Red Army and mobilize the masses to join the revolutionary war ?
Therefore , the idea that the soviet economic construction should not be undertaken in a revolutionary environment is extremely fallacious .
Those holding this view often express their desire to subordinate everything to the war , not realizing that blotting out economic construction actually weakens and affects the war , not subordinating it to the war .
Precisely for the purpose of subordinating economic construction to the war , we must undertake all kinds of necessary economic construction work , because it is an extremely necessary and indispensable factor of the revolutionary war .
Only when the work on the economic front is launched and the economy of the soviet areas developed will the revolutionary war acquire an appropriate material foundation , making it possible for us to launch more successful military attacks and deal effective blows on the enemy &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; Only then will we have the strength , to expand 1 million Red troops and extend our front several thousand li away .
Only then will the iron troops of our Red Army be able to hit Nan @-@ ch &apos;ang and Chiu @-@ chiang without a backward glance .
Only then will our Red Army soldiers be relieved of the chore of foraging for their own provisons and concentrate on fighting the enemies .
Only then will our broad masses be appropriately satisfied with their living and become more eager to serve in the Red Army and perform all kinds of revolutionary work .
Only by so doing can it be called subordination to the war ; otherwise , it will not be subordination to the war , but the absence of the one determining factor of the war .
This opportunist viewpoint is completely wrong .
Among the soviet work personnel in all areas , many still do not understand the importance of economic construction in the revolutionary war .
They have not truly placed the economic construction tasks on their shoulders .
Therefore ,
they have not devoted all their energy to implement the appeal of the Central Government or exerted a hundred @-@ fold effort to develop the movement on the economic front .
Take the following instances : Many government presidiums do not stress the discussion of economic construction .
The organization of the national economy department is still not sound .
Some of them have not even found a department chief , or they assign the unqualified to perform the work of the national economy department .
The development of the cooperative is still in .
the initial stage .
The work of balancing grain supplies is only performed in a part of the areas .
The various areas have not propagandized the task of economic construction to the broad masses .
This is extremely important .
The fervor to struggle for economic construction has not been created in the masses .
All such conditions are the result of failing to recognize the importance of economic construction .
At our rally this time , we must first severely oppose the erroneous viewpoints ; we must eliminate the erroneous opportunist viewpoint of overlooking economic construction .
Through discussion of the comrades at the rally and their transmission to the people when they return to their homes , we want to create a fervor among the entire soviet work personnel and the broad worker @-@ peasant masses , and clarify to them the position of economic construction in the revolutionary war , so.that they will devote their unanimous effort to selling 3 to 6 million yuan of economic construction bonds .
We want to develop the cooperative movement and recruit 1 million people to join the cooperatives , half for the consumer cooperatives and the other half for the grain cooperatives .
We want to build granaries generally and establish famine preparation storehouses .
Every county seat must organize a grain balancing branch bureau , and crucial areas and markets must organize grain balancing sub @-@ bureaus , so that , on the one hand , the shortages and surpluses in the soviet areas are balanced and the prices made more uniform and , on the other hand , the surplus grain of soviet areas is shipped out according to plans ( not unrestricted ) and sold at a high price , without the intermediate exploitation of the unconscionable merchants .
With the cash acquired from the White areas , we can purchase the necessities .
We want to vigorously develop agricultural and handicraft production , so that the harvest next year will be even greater and such special products as tungsten , lumber , camphor , paper , tobacco , summer cloth , mushrooms , and peppermint oil will resume their past output and be shipped out to the White areas in volume .
Tungsten , for instance , is an industry with a good future , because it is needed by the military industry of imperialism .
The export of tungsten has great prospects .
We must have several thousand or tens of thousands of people to mine tungsten .
For the development of agricultural production , the manufacture of farm tools and lime is extremely necessary .
In regard to the volumes of import and export trade , the largest export from the soviet areas is grain .
The central soviet area exports approximately 3 million , tan of grain a year .
With our 3 million people , the export of 1 tan of grain per capita to exchange for necessities is about the minimum .
Who is handling the transactions ?
They are exclusively handled by the merchants .
The merchants indulge in extremely cruel exploitations .
Last year , the peasants of Wan @-@ t &apos;ai sold the grain to the merchants at 0.50 yuan per tan , and the latter sold it in Kan @-@ chou at 4.00 yuan , an 8 @-@ fold profit .
Take another instance :
Our 3 million people consume almost 9 million yuan of salt and 6 million yuan of fabric per year .
Needless to say , the import of the 15 million yuan &apos;s worth of salt and fabric , so far , has been monopolized by the merchants , and our soviet has never interfered .
The merchants &apos; exploitation is unbelievable .
They buy salt in Chia @-@ ying @-@ chou , for instance , at 7 catties per yuan , bring it into the soviet area and sell at 12 ounces per yuan .
TsnTt such exploitation alarming ?
The soviet can no longer remain on the sideline .
We must take action from now on .
Our foreign trade bureau must devote a great effort in this aspect .
How do we plan to spend the proceeds of the 3 million economic construction bonds ?
We plan to use the money in the following way : 1 million to be allocated to the Red Army for its war expenditures ; 2 million to be loaned to the cooperatives , grain balancing bureaus , and foreign trade bureaus as their capital .
A small part will be used to develop production and a large part to develop import and export trade .
In addition to developing production , our goal is to sell our export high while buying salt and fabric low from the .White areas for distribution to the masses of the soviet areas .
We will thus break down the enemy blockade , resist exploitation by the merchants , develop the economy of the soviet areas daily , greatly improve the life of the masses , greatly increase the revenue of the soviet , and solidly build the material foundation of the revolutionary war .
However , we inquire whether such economic construction work can be performed in a violent environment of war ?
I think only the opportunists will say that it is impossible .
We are not saying that we want to build a railway to Lung @-@ yen , or a highway to Kan @-@ chou ; we are not saying that grain export or the 15 million yuan salt and fabric import will be exclusively handled by the government .
We do not say so , nor do we do so .
What we say and do is that we will temporarily use the 2 million capital , plus stocks of the people , to develop agricultural and handicraft production , export grain and tungsten , and import salt and fabric .
Are these things which should not , or cannot , be done ?
We have already begun to do the work and made some achievement .
The fall harvest this year shows an increase of 20 to 25 percent over last year , surpassing our estimate of a 20 percent increase .
In handicraft industry , the production of farm tools and lime is in the process of recovery .
The production of tungsten has begun to recover .
The production of tobacco , paper , and lumber is showing some life .
Much achievement has been made in grain balancing .
Some work has been done on the import of salt .
Such initial achievements constitute the foundation of our belief in the future .
The opportunists say that economic construction can only be undertaken after the conclusion of the war and that it is impossible now .
Are they not apparently wrong ?
Therefore , it is clear that , at the present stage , economic construction revolves around the central task of the revolutionary war .
The revolutionary war is the current central task , and economic construction is for its purpose , revolves around it , is subservient to it , and not a center in itself .
The idea that economic construction is the central task among all current tasks is likewise an opportunist viewpoint .
The revolutionary war requires that the soviet undertake the necessary economic construction .
To pursue economic construction apart from the revolutionary
war is erroneous .
Only after the conclusion of the domestic war can , and should , economic construction be considered the center of all tasks .
To do economic construction work which should be undertaken in peacetime in the future and not at present , and which is feasible in a future environment and infeasible under the present environment during the domestic war , is blind thinking .
The work today consists of items urgently needed by the war , and each item is for the war , not a peacetime undertaking apart from the war .
Any comrade entertaining such an erroneous view must be immediately corrected . ,
The issue of the leadership pattern in economic construction .
Without a correct leadership style and work method , it will be impossible to launch rapidly the movement on the economic front .
This is also an important problem and must be solved at this rally , because the comrades , upon returning to their homes , must immediately take action and direct the many personnel of the provincial , county , and area Soviets to work together , especially the comrades of the basic level and town Soviets , and the cooperatives , grain bureaus , trade bureaus , and purchasing offices .
They are in charge of the practical work , and they must personally mobilize the masses to organize cooperatives , balance and transport grain , and manage the import and export trade .
If their leadership pattern is incorrect , and if they cannot adopt all kinds of correct and effective methods in their work , it will immediately affect the result of the work and make it impossible for us to gain the support of the broad masses of our slogans and tasks and to complete the entire economic construction plan of the Central Government in the fall and winter of this year and the spring and summer of next year .
Therefore , I wish to clarify the following points to the comrades :
The first is to mobilize the masses organizationally .
Here , the presidiums of all levels of the government and the comrades of the national economy and finance departments must place the issuance of bonds , development of cooperatives , balancing of grain , promotion of production , and expansion of trade on the daily agenda for discussion , &apos; solution , supervision , and inspection .
Next , mass organizations must be activated , mainly labor unions and poor peasants1 leagues .
The labor union must be made to mobilize its membership masses to join the economic front .
The poor peasants &apos; league is an effective organization for mobilizing the masses to develop cooperatives and buy bonds .
The distinct and township Soviets must vigorously render them guidance .
Next , propaganda of economic construction must be done through mass meetings with the villages or hamlets as the units .
In the propaganda , the relationship between the revolutionary war and economic construction must be made very clear , and improving the people &apos;s life and increasing the struggle strength explained in a very practical manner .
Appeals must be made to the masses to buy 3 million yuan o bonds , develop cooperatives of 1 million people , balance the grain supply , stabilize the money market , and promote trade .
They must be urged to struggle for these slogans , and their fervor must be raised .
If we do not thus organizationally mobilize and propagandize to the masses , i.e. , if the
presidiums and the national economy and finance departments do not devote their effort to the discussion and examination of economic construction work , give a tention to activating the mass organizations , and propagandize by means of mass meetings , it will be impossible to attain our goal .
Second , the pattern of mobilizing the masses must not be bureaucratic .
The bureaucratic leadership pattern must not exist in any kind of revolutionary , work , and this applies to economic construction .
The bureaucratic leadership pattern , a most undesirable thing , must be thrown onto the trash pile .
No comrade likes it .
What the comrades prefer should be the Bolshevik work pattern , i.e. , the mass patterna pattern which leads to the closest association with the masses and is welcomed by the workers and peasants .
The manifestations of bureaucraticism are as follows : One is the indifferent or superficial opportunist negative slowdown , which is the worst phenomenon .
We must wage a strict struggle against it .
Another is commandism .
On the surface , there is no slowdown , and there is a semblance of great effort in the work .
Actually , developing the cooperative by commandism will not succeed .
Temporarily there may be a development in form , but it cannot be consolidated .
Confidence in the cooperative will be lost and its development blocked .
Selling bonds by commandism is another instance .
Regardless of whether the masses have understood or whether they can buy that much , bonds are sold arbitrarily according to the desired figures .
As a result , the masses are displeased , and the bonds cannot be sold successfully , We must never follow commandism .
We must propagandize vigorously and convince the masses by persuation .
We must develop the cooperative , sell bonds , and perform all economic mobilization work according to the concrete circumstances and the concrete manifestations of the sentiment of the masses .
Third , the economic construction movement requires large numbers of working cadres .
It is not an undertaking of tens or hundreds of people , but thousands and tens of thousands .
They must be organized , trained , and sent to the battlefield of economic construction .
They are the commanders on the economic front , while the broad masses are the soldiers .
The opportunist often laments the lack of cadres .
Comrades , is there really lack of cadres ?
Innumerable cadres have emerged from the masses tempered in the land struggle , economic struggle , and revolutionary war involving millions in the soviet areas .
How can one say there is a lack , of cadres ?
If the opportunist viewpoint is discarded , one will see the cadres standing in front of him .
Finally , I wish to say that economic construction is not only inseparable from &quot; the general task of war , but also from other tasks .
Only by an intensive land investigation movement will the rural class struggle be further developed , the positivity of the peasants increased , and the broad peasants rapidly led to the battlefield of economic construction .
Only by firmly implementing the labor law will the life of the worker @-@ peasant masses be improved , the worker masses rapidly recruited for economic construction enterprises , and their leadership effect on the peasants
strengthened .
Only by the correct guidance of the election movement and the prosecution movement , which is launched with the land investigation movement , will the soviet organs become even sounder and the soviet even more effective in guiding the revolutionary war , the work of all aspects , and economic work .
Improving the political and cultural levels of the masses is also of extreme importance in developing the national economy .
There is no need for me to stress the fact that the work of expanding the Red Army cannot be ignored even for one day .
You all know that , without the victories of the Red Army , the economic blockade would have been even more severe .
On the other hand , the development of the national economy and the improvement of the people &apos;s life will doubtlessly help expand the Red Army , so that the broad masses will march to the frontline in large groups .
In general , if we acquire all the factors discussed above , and if we also acquire the new and extremely important factor of economic construction , and subordinate all the factors to war , then , the victory of the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign will doubtlessly be ours .
( Enthusiastic applause ) .

CARRY OUT THE LAND INVESTIGATION MOVEMENT
Announcement Mo .
27 of the Provisional Central Government of the Soviet Republic of China
1 September 1933
&#91; Text &#93; In order to eliminate the remnant feudal forces , the Central Government promulgated the Land Investigation Directive and called a mass meeting in June , appealing to the masses to rise up and firmly launch the land investigation movement in all rural areas .
In the past several years , great achievements have been made .
Nevertheless , many areas have not launched the movement .
In some areas , people either protect the landlords and rich peasants , encroach upon the middle peasants , fail to hold mass meetings or make propaganda , confiscate without the approval of the masses , fail to distribute the confiscated articles to the masses , or fail to be firm in suppressing the counterrevolution .
These are grave errors .
In order to eliminate the feudal remnants promptly and enable the middle and poor peasants and the worker masses to receive all the benefits of the land revolution , the Central Government now makes this announcement to the governments of all areas and the broad worker @-@ peasant masses , asking all of them to rise up and support the order of the Central Government and , under the following methods , pursue a firm class struggle and strive for the complete success of the land investigation movement .
( 1 ) The governments and land investigation committees of all areas must closely tackle the leadership of the land investigation and activate the labor unions , poor peasants &apos; leagues and all mass organizations to soundly prosecute the land investigation movement .
They must first make extensive propaganda to the masses , so that everyone understands the significance of the movement and personally takes part in the land and class investigations .
( 2 ) Land investigation is not land division .
And class investigation is not an investigation of the middle peasants , poor peasants and farm laborers .
Therefore , it must not be carried out household by household , farm by farm , or by staking , but by activating all the revolutionary masses and concentrating on investigating the landlords and rich peasants .
( 3 ) Because the poor peasants &apos; league is the central force of the land investigation movement , it must be vigorously developed .
Any and every poor peasant may join the league without requirement of sponsorship .
All rural workers should join it so that they will lead the land investigation struggle .
The middle peasants may attend the meetings of the poor peasants &apos; league as observers .
( 4 ) The interests of the middle peasants absolutely must not be encroached upon .
The middle peasants must not be mistaken for rich peasants .
In regard to some well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasant elements , although they might have been guilty of some slight exploitation in the past , they must not be regarded as rich peasants .
All the middle peasant masses must rally around the poor peasants and together attack the landlords and rich peasants .
( 5 ) The rich peasants rely on their own labor and exploitation for their livelihood .
Therefore , they can only be allocated inferior land , and they must not be regarded as middle peasants .
Nor must they be regarded as landlords .
Confiscation of all their assets is wrong .
( 6 ) The landlords perform either no , or only incidental , labor .
They belong to the feudal exploiting class , and all their land and assets must be confiscated .
The able @-@ bodied among them must be organized into a labor team , given training and made to take part in state or local labor work .
( 7 ) After confiscation , the assets of the landlord class , except cash , must be promptly distributed to the impoverished masses of the particular village , Besides reserving the public enterprise field , the confiscated land must be promptly divided among the masses .
( 8 ) In regard to the landlord and rich peasant elements and those guilty of corruption and decadence , negative slowdown , commandism and coercion and sheltering the landlord and rich peasants who have infiltrated the soviet , the worker @-@ peasant masses must , under the leadership of the worker @-@ peasant procurators &apos; department , struggle against them , rectifying those committing minor mistakes and purging those guilty of grave errors , in order to consolidate the soviet political power .
( 9 ) All those participating in counterrevolutionary activities must receive severe suppression and those guilty of major crimes must be executed by shooting .
The worker @-@ peasant masses must successfully coordinate with the security bureau and judicial department of the soviet and thoroughly eliminate the counterrevolution .
( 10 ) The work of the land investigation movement should be concretely coordinated with the expansion of the Red Army , reinforcement of the Red Guard and Young Pioneers , sale of economic construction bonds , development of the cooperative , promotion of agriculture and industry , development of import and export trade , total enforcement of the labor law , development of the Lenin school and literacy movement , repair of bridges and roads and launching of the Soviet election movement .
All the broad worker @-@ peasant masses
must , under the leadership of the local soviet and with one mind and a unanimous effort , perform all necessary tasks , in order to smash promptly the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; of the imperialist Kuomintang and strive for the victory of the revolution throughout the whole of China .

THIS YEAR &apos;S ELECTION
Report at the Election Movement Meeting of the 18 Southern Counties
6 September 1933
&#91; Text &#93; Comrades , the election meeting of the 18 northern counties has been held .
Today , we hold the election meeting of the 18 southern counties .
Comrades , we hold elections every year .
Is there any difference between the election this year and that of the last ?
Yes , there is a great difference .
The election this year will result in a more consolidated Soviet the most important class weapon .
We will use this weapon to further improve the welfare of the masses , smash the enemy &apos;s new &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; resist the imperialist policy of dividing up China like a melon and expand the soviet movement throughout the nation .
Comrades , this is the significance of the election this year .
My report is to explain this significance .
I will discuss it in several sections .
( 1 ) This year &apos;s election is at a time when we have smashed the enemy &apos;s fourth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; and continue to strive for victory over its fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot;
From last year until the time of the victory of the battle of Tung @-@ huang @-@ p &apos;o , the fourth enemy &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; was completely smashed .
We have expanded the Red Army , consolidated and developed the Soviet areas and led and helped the nationwide great revolutionary struggles against imperialism , the Kuomintang and the landlords and capitalists .
The victories of the revolution have been greater than any previous year .
What about the counterrevolution ?
They are weaker than ever before .
The counterrevolution , however , is still waging a desperate struggle , especially imperialism .
Confronted by imminent world revolution and war , the imperialists are desperately invading China .
Japan has already established Manchukuo under its artillery and plans to form a nation of Mongolia .
England wants to set up a nation of Tibet in west China .
France invades Yunnan and Kweichow .
America hopes to divide up the Yangtze provinces .
All these imperialists are directing their running dog , the ECuomintang , to turn China into a colony , and the imperialist Kuomintang is carrying out its fifth large @-@ scale &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; against us .
Our current task is to smash the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; with a gigantic effort and resist the imperialist division of China .
Revolution and war of a larger scale are spread before our eyes .
The Soviet under the leadership of the Communist Party is the organiser and leader of the revolution and war .
The Soviet election this year is at the time of smashing the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; We must elect a powerful Soviet to organize and guide the war .
This is the momentous significance of this year &apos;s election .
This is also the year when the Second All @-@ Soviet Congress will be convened , and a new Central Government , the organizer and leader of the revolution and war on a national scale , elected .
To enable the Second All @-@ Soviet Congress to shoulder its great historical mission , the election this year cannot be regarded as an ordinary one .
( 2 ) In order to understand the importance of the election , we must explain the functions of the soviet .
There are two aspects in the functions of the Soviet , which is a worker @-@ peasant democratic dictatorship , and both aspects are completely contrary to the government of the old ruling class .
First , the Soviet of worker @-@ peasant democratic dictatorship is a weapon to hit the counterrevolution .
It eliminates the external counterrevolution by means of warour resistance to the eneney &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; in the past and at present , our victorious attacks , and our task to prosecute a revolutionary war against all the counter @-@ revolutionary forces in the nation .
Meanwhile , the Soviet suppresses the internal counterrevolution by means of the courtour handling , in the past and at present , of the AB League , the Reorganization Faction , the Social Democratic Party , the Trotskyites and all the landlords and capitalists in the soviet areas .
The moment they perform any counterrevolutionary activity , we immediately suppress them .
The revolutionary classthe toiling worker @-@ peasant masseshandles internal and external counterrevolution with the Soviet as the weapon .
This is the first function of the Soviet .
Only when all the counterrevolutions are overcome will our class become the ruling class and our political power the ruling political power .
As you can all see , we are in control today because we have overcome innumerable enemy attacks and suppressed the counterrevolutionary activities all along .
Now we will discuss the second function .
The Soviet of worker @-@ peasant democratic dictatorship is a tool for the masses to manage their own lives .
The lives of our worker @-@ peasant masses were entirely managed by the landlords and bourgeoisie in the past .
Because they possessed political power , they enjoyed freedom , while withholding freedom from us .
The peasants had no land .
The workers had no labor law for their protection .
What about today ?
The peasants have land , and the workers enjoy the protection of the labor law .
Our own political power gives us freedom , and we promote all kinds of necessary construction under our own political power .
We completely manage our own lives .
We are truly free and equal , without interference from any landlord or capitalist , while we enforce dictatorship over the landlords and capitalists , excluding them from participation in our political power .
We formulate all kinds of laws to control them , giving them no political freedom at all .
This is the function of the Soviet in the second aspect .
All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing political power and consolidating it , while the desperate struggle of the counterrevolutionaries against the revolutionary forces is solely for the purpose of defending their political power .
The worker @-@ peasant masses in the Soviet areas have already seized political power .
We tnust defend and develop it so that it can fulfill the momentous functions of hitting internal and external counterrevolutionary forces and improving the living condition and welfare of the workers and peasants .
We must elect large groups of the most advanced and most positive elements , with the greatest awareness , into the Soviet , and eliminate unsatisfactory elements among the existing personnel .
This is important .
Many people do not understand clearly the solemn significance of political power and elections .
If they do not understand the functions of the Soviet , they will not participate in the election in a positive manner .
When the Soviet personnel do not understand them , they will not guide the election successfully .
Comrades , the election will soon be held .
To spread the effect of the Soviet and the election among the masses , Soviet personnel must first understand it clearly .
Only then will the election this year be successful .
Only then will we mobilize unanimously and struggle for the building of a powerful Soviet of worker @-@ peasant democratic dictatorship !
( 3 ) There are the favorable conditions in the election this year .
We are at the most critical point of the revolution and war , while the effect of the Soviet and its election is momentous .
Can the task be accomplished in the election this year ?
Our answer is , Yes , because we have many favorable conditions .
First , although the scale of the fifth enemy &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; is very large , we already have initial successes .
In the past 2 months , we won three successive big battles .
We captured Lien @-@ deleted and defeated the 19th Route Army in the first battle .
We took Wu @-@ chiang and routed the 80th Division in the second battle .
We laid siege to Yen @-@ pTing and repelled enemy reenforcements in the third battle .
Over 6,000 weapons were captured .
We will hold the election during the great victories of the Red Army .
Second , the election this year will cover a wider area because we have greatly expanded the Soviet territory by smashing the fourth &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; We will hold elections this year in 10 soviet provinces Kiangsi , Fukien , Kwangtung @-@ Kiangsi , Fukien @-@ Kiangsi , Fukien @-@ Chekiang @-@ Kiangsi , Hunan @-@ Kiangsi , Hunan @-@ Hupeh @-@ Kiangsi , Hupeh @-@ Honan @-@ Anhwei . , Hunan @-@ Hupeh @-@ deleted and Szechwan .
The scale of the election will be bigger .
Third , in many Soviet provinces , the rural urban class struggles are more intensive this year than last year .
Many achievements have been made in the land investigation movement , the enforcement of the labor law , culture and education and economic construction .
Especially in the land investigation movement , many hidden landlords and rich peasants have been uncovered and their right to vote deprived .
Undesirables concerned in the Soviet organs
have been purged in large groups .
All these constitute the foundation for a more successful election this year .
Fourth , we possess experiences of past elections , especially last year , which are valuable lessons for the election this year .
We must continue with the good achievements of past elections and bring them to a greater light , but we must avoid and discard the defects and errors and guard against their repetition .
The Central Government has made a correct summary in its directive and clarified the achievements and the errors of past elections .
The comrades must study them carefully , and each and every Soviet work comrade must do likewise and explain them clearly to the voting masses .
Only when the lessons of the past are correctly understood will the election this time become even more successful .
( 4 ) How to guide the election this year .
Comrades , as we know that the election this year is at the time when the imperialist Kuomintang divides up China and carries out the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; the political task of the election has &quot; been greatly increased .
Because we also know the great revolutionary effect of the Soviet , while the election will be held under many favorable conditions , we must properly guide the election and strive for its complete success with a mighty effort .
In regard to the principle and methods of election , the Central Government has made them very clear in the Election Law and Election Directive , and I will not repeat them item by item .
Today , 1 wish only to bring several important issues to the comrades &apos; attention .
These are the propaganda and agitation of the election , basic election , voter registration , work reporting , election units , , candidates &apos; lists , voters &apos; mass meeting and the duties of the election committee .
Let me present a simple explanation of these issues , because they are extremely important and require the attention of each and every comrade .
The first issue concerns the propaganda of the election .
For the election this year , we must perform the most extensive propaganda in the 3 weeks before the election , explaining the relationship between smashing the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; and resisting the imperialist division of China and the election this year , the revolutionary functions of the Soviet , and the fact that the election is held on the foundation of victory .
Then the masses will regard the election as something vital , participate in it with full confidence and elect many advanced elements to the Soviet .
Those elected will undertake the affairs of the state with courage .
Such propaganda and agitation are the prerequisites of a successful election .
Without them , the masses will not understand the current political situation , the functions of the Soviet and the foundation of victory of the election .
Then , they will not enthusiastically participate in the election , nor will the elected increase their courage .
The propaganda for the first election last year was relatively good .
Therefore , the achievement was also relatively good .
The propaganda for the second election was inferior .
Therefore , the achievement was also inferior .
This year , the election propaganda must surpass that of the first election last year in order to encourage the greater majority of the masses to participate in it .
Second , the urban and rural congresses are the basic organizations of the Soviet .
Therefore , their election is the Soviet &apos;s basic election .
The urban and rural Soviets are the level closest to the masses .
All decrees and policies of the higher level soviet and all tasks of expanding the Red Army , land investigation movement , the labor law , economic construction and cultural construction must go through them before practical implementation .
The election of the urban and rural Soviets is , therefore , the most basic and important election .
Moreover , a successful all @-@ Soviet congress will require good representatives from the provincial soviet congresses .
A successful provincial soviet congress will require good representatives from the county soviet congresses .
A successful county soviet congress will require good representatives from the district and town soviet congresses .
What is required for a successful district soviet congress ?
It will require good representatives from the township soviet congresses .
The election of the town and township Soviets is linked with the entire Soviet election of the district , county , province and nation .
That is why the election of the town and township Soviets is the most basic and most vital .
Comrades , a Red Army patriots &apos; memorial tower is being erected along the side of our meeting ground .
The tower has a 15 @-@ foot rock foundation .
To build a strong tower , we must begin with a strong foundation .
To build a strong Soviet , we must also begin with a strong foundation , which is the urban and rural soviet congresses .
Third , to build firm urban and rural Soviets , not only must we make the most propaganda to get the greater majority of the masses to come to the election meetings , but we must be sure that all the voters coming to the meetings are genuine workers , peasants and others entitled to vote and that no person who has been deprived of his voting right infiltrates the meetings and that no person who should have his voting right deprived misrepresents himself as a worker or peasant .
This task is called voter registration .
The strict demarcation between those with and those without the voting right is the basic starting point of the Soviet political power and the most important item in the Soviet constitution and election law .
Look .
Isn &apos;t the tower foundation made of stones ?
The tower is , therefore , firm .
If some dirt and manure are mixed in it , the tower will not be so firm .
If we want to build a firm Soviet , we must start by guarding against any landlord , rich peasant , or capitalist stealing the voting right .
Fourth , the election unit last year was too big .
This year , it is reduced .
Article 11 of the Election Law provides that the workers will hold a separate election meeting , the peasants will use the village as the unit and the urban poor will elect according to the neighborhoods .
This change has a close connection with the complete success of the election , because when the election unit is small , it will not only enable most or all of the voters to come to the election meeting , but make it easier for the voters to select among the candidates , improve the quality and quantity of the voters &apos; proposals and facilitate the exercise of the recall rights in the future .
Therefore , the comrades must refrain from making the election unit any larger .
Fifth , in regard to the work reports to the voters by the town and township Soviets , the Central Internal Affairs Department has drafted an outline .
The district soviet must guide the township Soviets to call mass meetings in the various villages and make reports , according to the outline .
In the election last year , many areas did not follow the report system .
This year , it must be followed , because , by reporting to the masses , government work will have a chance to undergo mass inspection , and the enthusiasm of the voters will reach a higher pitch .
The governments of the district level and above must make work reports when the lower level governments hold their congresses .
Sixth , in regard to the list of candidates , its proper preparation is an important link for the success of the election .
As stated in the directive o the Central , the opinions of the masses on the candidates must be collected before the election and published , 30 that the voters will be able to give full consideration to the candidates .
Primary attention must be given to the components of the candidates1 list .
Not only the proper numbers of workers and peasants must be elected according to the Election Law , but at least 25 percent of the elected must be laboring women , in accordance with the Election Directive .
Next , attention must be .given to the candidates &apos; political manifestations .
All those guilty of corruption , decadence and negative slowdown and all those compromising with the landlords , rich peasants and capitalists must not be elected .
All those elected must be positive in their work and correct in their concept .
Next , suitable attention must be given to the work capacity .
Those whose ability is too inferior must not be elected into the government .
Then , among the current Soviet work personnel , such as delegates , committee members and chairmen , all those who are guilty of grave mistakes such as corruption and decadence , negative slowdown , bureaucraticism and sheltering landlords , rich peasants and capitalists and have not reformed , must not be reelected .
But those comrades who are positive in work and correct in concept may be reelected without question .
It is entirely wrong to think that election means electing new people for all the posts and discarding all the existing personnel .
The seventh point concerns the election mass meeting .
Election itself requires only 1 day , but its preparation will take weeks , because the many important tasks discussed above must have several weeks for their preparation .
It is absolutely necessary , therefore , to make the preparations in advance .
We must not put it off day @-@ after @-@ day and only become busy 2 or 3 days before the election .
Now the 18 northern counties have scheduled 1 September to 5 October as the period for urban and rural elections .
The various districts must schedule the election in the last 10 days and devote the several weeks before 25 September to the work of election propaganda , voter registration , work reports and candidates1 lists before full success can be achieved on election day .
The 18 southern counties may hold the election a month later , at the end of October , and devote the months of September and October to preparation .
Next , on election day , the voters must be mobilized to attend the meeting .
This year , we must be able to get the greatest majority of the voters to come to the election meeting and succeed in completing the election
at one meeting .
We must avoid having to call a second meeting because of the lack of a quorum for the first meeting .
Still next , when the list of candidates is proposed at the election meeting for discussion and voting , the masses must be activated to express their opinions , similar to the enthusiastic criticisms at the election meeting in Hsing @-@ kuo last year .
The masses must not be forced to pass the list of candidates if they do not approve of any one of them .
Should there be any evil elements making trouble and forcing the masses to pass the candidates &apos; list prepared by them , they must be severely punished upon discovery .
Lastly , after the election , the proposals of the masses must be discussed and their opinions collected and presented to the Soviet to serve as the administrative policy of the new government .
Eighth , the tasks discussed above require a special organ for their handling .
This is the election committee of the town and district Soviets .
According to Article 46 of the Election Law , the election committee is formed by the representatives of the government and the various mass organizations and approved by the county soviet .
It is responsible for all the work of the election .
Most of the election committees last year did not produce any effect , and the election was directed by government personnel only .
Therefore , the election was not carefully guided in many areas .
There were also instances of undesirables in the government manipulating the election .
To avoid such shortcomings , election committees must be organized this year , to be formed by the government and mass organizations .
Comrades , I said much .
I have discussed the significance of election and the important points of election work .
As for what I have not touched upon that the county soviet must guide all the district soviet congresses of the county with plans , that the provincial soviet must guide all the county soviet congresses of the province with plans , that the Central must guide all the provincial soviet congresses with plans , and individual items concerning the electiondetailed instructions are given in the Election Law and the Election Directive , which I shall not reiterate here .
In regard to the important points discussed by me here , I hope the comrades will repeat them to the comrades of the county and district Soviets and bring them up at the presidium meetings for detailed discussion .
Comrades , this year &apos;s election is not an ordinary one .
It is an election with great historical significance , a sharp class struggle .
We must handle it with our full attention .
Besides the many tasks connected with the election itself , we must seize the opportunity and launch the land investigation and class investigation struggles and the Soviet prosecution movement .
Only through class investigation and the prosecution movement will we uncover those stealing the voting right , purge the undesirables infiltrating the Soviet and make the election this time more successful .
This is especially true with the 18 southern counties , because there are still 2 more months for us to proceed with the land investigation movement .
In addition , in areas where the administrative divisions have not been defined , they must be promptly .
By so doing , we firmly believe that this year &apos;s election will be a complete success .
Currently , the proletariat and oppressed nations of the whole
world are hoping for the success of China &apos;s soviet movement .
And the toiling masses of the entire nation are looking for the Soviet banner .
They understand that only the Soviet can save China .
In these few days , the delegates of various nations are holding an anti @-@ imperialist war rally in Shanghai .
They , likewise , eagerly hope for the success of China &apos;s soviet .
Comrades , we must respond to all such eager hopes .
How do we do so ?
We will respond to them with the success of the election of all the soviet areas , with our Second All @-@ Soviet Congress .
Our slogans are
Strive for the complete success of the election !
Smash the fifth enemy &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; !
Resist imperialist division of China !
Long live Soviet China !
KED CHINA , No 10S , 6 September 1933
DECLARATION TO THE TOILING WO EKE R @-@ PEAS ANT MASSES OF THE WORLD
6 September 1933
&#91; Text &#93; Dear Brothers , Sisters , Comrades , Friends !
We are China &apos;s workers , peasants , urban and rural poor and revolutionary soldiers and intellectuals .
We are unwilling to remain forever the slaves of imperialism and domestic landlords and capitalists .
We are creating our own new life of freedom .
We are in the process of leading the 450 million people of China to wage a struggle of liberation .
On one @-@ sixth of China &apos;s soil ( in many areas in the provinces of Kiangsi , Fukien , Hupeh , Hunan , Szechwan , Anhwei &gt; Honan and Shensi ) , we have , by our own effort , begun to create the one and only true people &apos;s political powerthe Soviet political power and the one and only true peopleTs armythe Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army .
China &apos;s Soviet government and Red Army struggle for the fundamental improvement of the political and economic conditions of China &apos;s toiling worker @-@ peasant masses .
China &apos;s Soviet government and Red Army wish to attain this point right from the beginningto let the workers , peasants , poor people and revolutionary soldiers and intellectuals do what they want to do freely and decide on their own destiny .
We want to enable those who are without food , clothing , housing and jobs ; who are illiterate and live as beasts of burden to have food , clothing , housing and jobs ; be able to read and to live human lives .
In order to achieve this , the Soviet government has given them land , houses and jobs ; opened many free schools , literacy classes , libraries and clubs for the adults and children ; and started many free hospitals and sana @-@ toriums for the sick and the old .
Yet , the small group of parasites controlling Chinaforeign imperialists and Chinese warlords , bureaucrats , landlords , capitalists , usurersare always unwilling for us to live a human life .
Precisely because we have begun to create our own new life of freedom , because we only work 8 hours a day at higher wages , because those of us with little or no land now have land and because our women have gained liberation , Chiang Kai @-@ shek , Wang Ching @-@ wei and all the Kuomintang beasts revile us as &quot; Red bandits &quot; and &quot; communists bandits &apos; and continually launch &quot; encirclement &apos;and suppression &quot; against us .
When Japanese imperialism wildly slaughtered our compatriots and occupied China &apos;s Northeast and northern territory province by province , and when American , British and French imperialists actively divided China , we declared to the people and troops of the entire nation , time and again : The imperialists want to divide up China completely .
All the people of China must rise up as a man to defend the nation !
We have openly proposed over and over to all the troopsany troops , as long as they support our three simple conditionsthey may sign battle agreements with us , in order to arm ourselves and resist Japan and other imperialists , defend our national existence and strive for national liberation .
The necessary conditions to truly organize and arm the people for the sacred national defense against Japan and other imperialists are : ( 1 ) immediately cease attacks on Soviet areas ; ( 2 ) give the people the minimum democratic rights the freedoms of speech , publication , meeting , association , demonstration and strike ; and ( 3 ) permit the people to organize and arm the anti @-@ Japanese volunteer army ,
Chiang Kai @-@ shek , Wang Ching @-@ wei and all the Kuomintang traitors always reply to us in the same way : Intensify and expand the cruel attack of the Soviet areas !
The Kuomintang has now begun its sixth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; against our free Soviet China !
For this &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; just around our central Soviet area alone ( Kiangsi , Fukien , Hunan and Kwangtung ) . , over 442,000 Nanking and Kwangtung troops are assembled .
These troops are equipped with new model superior weapons , including artillery , tanks , planes and poison gas .
Where did the Kuomintang warlords and politicians acquire so many new weapons and large sums of money for their troops ?
They acquired them from the American , British , Japanese , French and German imperialists .
These imperialists utilize the weapons manufactured by you and the money extracted from you to destroy the people of China who are struggling for their own national and social liberation !
You and we still remember clearly that , not long ago , the troops of England , America and Japan shelled our Canton Commune and ChTang @-@ sha Soviet , and the planes of French bombed our Lung @-@ chou Soviet in Kwangsi !
In the Kuomintang &apos;s sixth &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; the role of the imperialists is clearly revealed .
Besides the 50 @-@ million dollars of so @-@ called &quot; cotton and wheat loans &quot; and the 40 @-@ million dollars of so @-@ called &quot; aviation loans &quot; to the Nanking government , American imperialism gave the Nanking troops 150 military planes and artillery , tanks , machine guns , chemical poisons and ammunition loaded in several dozen ships and sent several hundred pilots and all kinds of military and technical experts .
The British ambassador to China ( Lampson ) personally went on an inspection trip to
Szechwan and gave Liu Hsiang 20 million English pounds to attack our Red 4th Army there .
Though the British , American and Japanese imperialists vigorously compete against one another in the division of China , they take unanimous action against soviet China .
They order their own running dogsthe warlords of the Nanking , Kwangtung and northern factionsto conduct a common &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; of the liberated people of our Soviet areas .
The German fascist government sent 70 military experts ( including the former National Defense Chief ( Sai @-@ k &apos;o @-@ t &apos;o ^ to Nanking .
Chiang Kai @-@ shek organized them into a special unit in the Nan @-@ ch &apos;ang General Headquarters , in order to direct the combat activities against the Red Army .
The so @-@ called &quot; Technical Committee &quot; sent by the League of Nations to Nanking precisely at this time actually is to help Chiang Kai @-@ shek plan and attack China &apos;s Soviet and the Red Army .
Brothers , Sisters , Comrades , Friends !
Look !
The pilots and the military and technical experts of the so @-@ called &quot; democratic &quot; America and other nations are , under the direction of Germany &apos;s fascist generals and China &apos;s Kuomintang warlords , carrying out the cruelest air and chemical warfare with American , British , French and German planes , poison gas , tanks and artillery in the territory o the Soviet China and slaughtering large numbers of workers , peasants , soldiers , poor people and intellectuals , in order to eliminate the free Chinese Soviet Republic and Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army
Brothers , Sisters , Comrades , Friends !
In order to defend their own Soviet Republic , thousands and tens of thousands of men and women , old and young , did not hesitate to use their own flesh and blood , brains and lives to repel courageously the five successive &quot; encirclement and suppressions &quot; of the Kuomintang , superior in number and weaponry .
Today , this young Chinese Soviet Republic faces a grave crisis .
At this critical point , we request you
To help us resist the executioners who want us to relive the dark inhuman life and slaughter us !
To make us relive the dark life of slavery of the past , the international imperialists are determined to drown China &apos;s soviet revolution In a sea of blood .
The British , American , Japanese and French imperialist bandits are concentrating warships , airplanes and marines around Soviet China and all its large cities and coastal ports .
They want to massacre us first before proceeding with a new imperialist world war , causing gigantic sacrifices and misery to mankind in the whole world !
The Central Executive Committee , the supreme organ of the Soviet Republic of China , solemnly appeals to you to join us in a courageous mass struggle :
Resist imperialist intervention in the Soviet China !
Resist imperialist division of China !
Resist imperialist preparation of a new imperialist world war while massacring the people of China !
Resist the massacre of the toiling people of Soviet China by the imperialists with poison gas , planes , tanks and artillery !
Oppose the shipping of all arms to China !
Demand the immediate recall of American pilots and military experts and German generals and staff !
Demand the immediate withdrawal of American , British , Japanese , Trench and Italian navies , infantry and air force ;
Long live the international sympathy of the proletariat and oppressed people of the whole world !

&#91; Text &#93; Culture and education occupy an important position in the entire soviet movement and constitute an indispensable force in the current mobilization against the fifth enemy &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; Intensifying education to raise the political and cultural levels of the broad masses , enhance their class awareness and train revolutionary successors is one of our major tasks .
The education work at present apparently lags behind other soviet work and still cannot truly keep pace with the need of the successful development of the revolutionary war .
It is due to the many errors and defects in the work of the Education Department so far , the neglect of education by some soviet organs and responsible comrades , the failure to understand the importance of education in the current domestic war , and even the opportunist viewpoint that it is impossible to pursue education in an environment of war .
This situation must not be allowed to continue .
The biggest defect of education so far is the lack of a clear policy .
Though the issue was mentioned in Directive No 1 of the Central Education Department , it was inadequate and not completely correct .
The Education Department has so far , as shown in its work and documents , neglected to build a popular free education system .
It has not properly linked popular education with social education and developed them .
Instead of placing the task of communist education in the forefront , it limits education to the realm of the bourgeois democratic tasks of opposing feudalism and superstition .
Meanwhile , it must also be pointed out that the lack of planning to wipe out illiteracy , an extremely important cultural @-@ educational task , and the &quot; leftwing &quot; opportunist error on the issue of utilizing bourgeois intellectuals are , so far , the big defects of the work of the Education Department .
While mobilizing for the current revolutionary war , we must establish a free popular education system , create revolutionary successors according to the communist spirit and spread Marxist @-@ Leninist revolutionary theories .
We must completely eliminate in the shortest possible time the most vicious legacy left by the evil gentry and landlord bourgeoisieilliteracy .
must set up Lenin teachers &apos; schools and all types of cadre training schools , cultivate a powerful educators &apos; army that can popularize education and give full attention to and organise the development of social education work such as worker @-@ peasant drama associations , blue @-@ shirt leagues , clubs , libraries and reading rooms .
These constitute the education policy and central task at the present time .
Besides training large groups of worker @-@ peasant education work cadres , we must utilize those bourgeois intellectuals and experts who are willing to serve the Soviet .
Whenever possible , we must educate and give preferential treatment to elementary school teachers .
At the very least , we must give government funds to the elementary school students for their books and stationary and meals to the elementary school teachers .
The People &apos;s Committee is in complete agreement with the Central Education Department &apos;s suggestion to hold a culture and education rally with the League Central Bureau in October .
Without doubt , such a rally will be extremely important in the future of the culture and education of the Soviet areas .
For its complete success , the Central Education Department is charged with the responsibility of making full preparations .
The PeopleTs Committee believes that the education work assistance movement recently initiated by the League Central Bureau will serve as an effective surprise attack on the culture @-@ education front of the Soviet areas and help to expedite the elimination of the backward situation of education .
For the prompt and thorough change in education work and the successful completion of the central task of education at the present time , we must ruthlessly struggle against the neglect of education and all the incorrect concepts in education work .
Only under such art ideological struggle will the culture @-@ education construction of the Soviet areas urgently needed by the war be truly developed .
It is so ordered .

CORRECT COMMANDISM IN SELLING BONDS
Letter From the Central Government to the Governments of All Levels
23 September 1933
&#91; Text &#93; Provincial Soviets of Kiangsi , Fukien , Fukien @-@ Kiangsi and Kwangtung @-@ Kiangsi , County Soviet of Jut @-@ chin and Soviet Governments of All Levels :
Because of the issuance of the economic construction bonds , great achievements have been made within a short time .
In all areas where the means of mobilization is good , the broad masses enthusiastically arose to support the bonds , such as Yun @-@ chi District in Jui @-@ chin and Ts &apos;ai @-@ ch &apos;l and Hung @-@ fang districts in Fukien , which are all good examples .
In many other areas , nevertheless , there has been the grave error of commandist allocation .
The People &apos;s Committee has issued Directive No 16 , an announcement , and propaganda outline pointing out that full mobilization is the guarantee of bond selling and severely opposing commandism .
In its letter of instruction to the bond committees of all levels , the Central People &apos;s Finance Committee extended the time limit for bond selling to December .
The number of bonds to be sold is determined according to the local situation to avoid coercive allocation and afford the local areas ample time for mobilization and selling .
Since the issuance of such instructional documents , methods of selling bonds in all areas is changing .
The change , nevertheless , is extremely inadequate .
Many areas are still practicing coercive allocation .
The most serious instance occurred in Lo @-@ fang District in Yu @-@ tu , where a middle peasant and the district soviet chairman committed suicide due to the coercive allocation of bonds .
The 400 or more people who fled their homes in Hsiao @-@ ch &apos;i District in Kwangtung @-@ Kiangsi were also connected with coercive allocation .
These were shameful incidents which should never have occurred .
Yet , they did .
Upon hearing the news , the Central sent men to investigate and will severely punish the Yu @-@ tu county soviet .
When this letter is received , the provincial Soviets must immediately instruct the county Soviets to inspect the mobilization method of bond selling in the districts and townships .
They must warn the soviet personnel with the example of Yu @-@ tu , immediately launch a campaign of intense self @-@ criticism , concentrate the firepower against coercive commandism
In all work and never resort to it whether in expanding the Red Army , the land Investigation movement , the election movement , the sale of bonds , or the development of cooperatives .
Yu @-@ tu &apos;s commandist error has occurred seriously in its work in all aspects , but more apparent in the sale of bonds .
The lessons of Lo @-@ fang and Hsiao @-@ ch &apos;i districts also serve as the gravest warnings to the Soviets of all levels .
In order to complete the sale of bonds successfully , attention must be given to the time and amount .
In the competition agreements of the various areas , many of them have set mid- ^ October as the deadline .
It is too short .
They must follow the 15 September instruction of the People &apos;s Finance Committee and appropriately extend the time limit .
In areas where the harvest or bond selling is late , it may be extended to mid @-@ December for the final completion of sale , in order to afford them sufficient time for mobilization work .
They must not , however , follow the example of Hui @-@ ch &apos;ang and other areas ; that put bond selling aside , wait for an extension , become slack on the performance of the work and try to reach the goal by coercive allocation in December .
This is absolutely not permitted .
In regard to the amount , it depends entirely on the practical local situation and the extent of the mass positivity .
There may be increases and reductions .
There must he no mechanical allocation .
The county and district Soviets must increase or decrease the amounts of bonds according to the different situations of the various counties and district , in order to adapt to the local conditions .
They must not issue the bonds all at one time and consider their tasks as ended , thus forcing the lower level to the path of coercive allocation .
This bureaucratic pattern must be immediately rectified .

0 &quot; Decision of the Central Government concerning Certain Issues in the Land Struggle &quot; ( mimeographed ) , Central Government People &apos;s Committee , 1933
DECISION ON CERTAIN ISSUES IN THE LAND STRUGGLE Passed by the People &apos;s Committee 10 October 1933
&#91; Text &#93; In the struggle of land division and land investigation , many practical issues arose .
Such issues were a result of lack of provision in previous documents , ambiguity in the provisions , or incorrect interpretation on the part of soviet personnel .
To rectify and prevent errors , the People &apos;s Committee , besides approving the principles of analyzing the landlords , rich peasants , middle peasants , poor peasants and workers in &quot; &quot; How To Analyze the Classes , &quot; hereby makes the following decision :
Labor and Incidental Labor
Under ordinary conditions , if one member in the family spent one @-@ third of his time a year on major work , it is called labor .
If it was less than one @-@ third of his time , or if it was not devoted to major work , even though it involved one @-@ third of his time , it is called incidental labor .
Attention must be given to the following :
( 1 ) The rich peasants performed their own labor , and the landlords performed either no , or only incidental , labor .
Labor is , therefore , the major criterion to distinguish rich peasants and landlords .
( 2 ) One person is the criterion to determine labor for a household .
Where there were several members in a household , if one of them labored , the household is considered as performing labor .
Some people feel that only when two members , or the entire household , performed labor can the household be considered as performing labor .
This is not correct .
( 3 ) The criterion to determine the time spent on labor is one @-@ third of the year , i.e. , 4 months .
Performing major labor for 4 full months , or less than 4 full months , is the dividing line between labor and incidental labor ( the dividing line between rich peasants and landlords ) .
It is erroneous for some people to consider performing major labor for 6 months out of the year as incidental labor .
( 4 ) Major labor indicates labor in the major tasks of production , such as plowing , planting , harvesting and other important production labor .
However , labor is not limited to agricultural production .
Firewood chopping , porterage and other important tasks are all considered major labor .
( 5 ) Non @-@ major labor refers to all kinds of supplementary labor , occupying a secondary position in production , such.as assisting in weeding , assisting in vegetable planting , looking after draft animals , etc .
( 6 ) Labor is the main criterion used to distinguish the rich peasants and landlords .
Those who only hired permanent help to cultivate the land , did not exploit by land rents or loan interests , were responsible for directing their own production , but did not personally perform major labor are still considered landlords snd will not receive land allocations .
( 7 ) The time element for the landlord classification is computed backward from the time of the uprising .
, .
Those who lived as landlords for 3 years or more are considered landlords .
Many errors have occurred on the issue of labor and incidental labor in the land investigation movement .
Major labor was called incidental labor and people were misclassified as landlords .
Or , incidental labor was mistaken for major labor and the people misclassified as rich peasants .
This came from the lack of a clear criterion between landlords and rich peasants .
According to the above provisions , such errors can be avoided .
The above provisions , nevertheless , are only &quot; under ordinary conditions . &quot; Under special conditions , different handling is required .
If one member of a household exploited by collecting large sums of land rent or loan interest , such as collecting 100 tan or more of land rent or lending 1,000 yuan or more in large currency , and the members in the household were not numerous nor the expenses high , even if someone in the household performed 4 or more months of major labor in a year , it is still considered a landlord household , not a rich , peasant household .
On the other hand , if the members in the household were numerous and the expenses high , even if there was 100 tan of land rent or 1,000 yuan of loans , if someone in the household performed major labor , it is not a landlord household , but a rich peasant household .
There are cases , too , of households being considered landlords according to their exploitation situation , but not landlords according to their living condition .
For instance , an individual who was once a rich or middle peasant , but who , a few years before the uprising , suddenly lost his labor force due to illness or death and had to rent out all his land or hire people to cultivate for him .
His entire household lived as a landlord household , it is improper to consider him a landlord .
He must be classified according to his original status .
Or , an individual who was nominally a landlord but whose land actually belonged to someone else , whose income from exploitation was small , &apos; who performed incidental labor , and who lived &apos;a life even inferior to the peasants , must be considered a rich peasant and allocated poorer land .
In extreme cases , with the consent of the masses , they may be allocated land of similar quality as the peasants .
Finally , those who were peasants in the past , but suddenly became wealthy due to special opportunities 2 years
before the uprising and turned into landlords may , with the consent of the masses , be allocated inferior land the same as the rich peasants , while their own land must be confiscated , because they were peasants 2 years ago .
The special situations discussed above have been overlooked in some areas in the land investigation movement .
Well @-@ to @-@ do Middle Peasants
Well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants who engaged in some minor exploitation of others are a part of the middle peasants .
Their income from exploitation must not have exceeded 15 percent of the total household annual receipt .
Under certain conditions , though the exploitation income exceeded 15 percent of the total annual income , if it did not exceed 30 percent and if the masses do not oppose them , the parties concerned are still considered well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants .
Under the soviet political .power , the interests of the well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants receive the same protection as middle peasants in general .
Attention must be given to the following
( 1 ) The well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants &apos;are a part of the middle peasants .
The difference is that they engaged in some minor exploitation of others wbile the middle peasants did not .
( 2 ) The difference between the well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants and the rich peasants is that the exploitation income of the former did not exceed 15 percent of the total household annual income while that of the latter exceeded 15 percent .
This demarcation is required to determine the class classifications .
( 3 ) The minor exploitation by the well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants refers to such acts as hiring shepherd boys , part @-@ time help , or monthly help , lending out small amounts of money , collecting small amounts on loans or school rent , or renting out small parcels of land , provided the income from such exploitations did not constitute an important part of the livelihood of the household , i.e. , not more than 15 percent , and that the important source of its livelihood was the labor of its members .
( 4 ) Those whose amount of exploitation was the same as the rich peasants close to the time of the uprising , but the time of such exploitation did not exceed 2 years , are still considered well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants .
( 5 ) When we say that , under certain conditions , although the exploitation income exceeded 15 percent of the total household annual income , if it did not exceed 30 percent , and if the masses do not oppose them , the parties concerned are still considered well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants , the &quot; certain conditions &quot; indicate that , although the exploitation amount exceeded 15 percent , the members of the household were numerous , its labor force small
and its living condition not luxurious .
In the event of flood , droughts famine , illness or death , they might even find themselves in difficulty .
Under the above conditions , the parties concerned must not be considered rich peasants , but middle peasants , provided the exploitation amount did not exceed 30 percent of the total household annual income .
Where such conditions did not exist , those whose exploitation income exceeded 15 percent of their total household annual income are considered rich peasants , not well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants .
The determination on the presence or absence of the conditions is by the public opinion of the local masses .
The well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants constitute a considerable portion of the rural population .
In the land investigation movement in many areas , they have been handled as rich peasants , which is incorrect .
Most of the incidents of encroaching upon the middle peasants which occurred in various areas involved the well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants .
This must be immediately rectified .
Examples :
( 1 ) A household of six members in which two of them performed labor owned 50 tan of land , actually producing 35 tan of grain ( total value 140 yuan , at 4 yuan per tan current price ) , completely farmed by the household .
They had a 5 @-@ room house , a cow and a pond which produced 12 yuan large currency .
Their annual income from sundry grain production and hog raising was approximately 100 yuan .
They loaned out 3 tan of raw grain at 50 percent interest , collecting 1.5 tan a year ( value 6 yuan ) for 4 years .
They loand out money in the sum of 100 yuan large currency ( equivalent to 1,800 mao small currency ) , at 25 percent interest , collecting 25 yuan a year for 5 years .
Decision : The household depended on its own labor as the main source of its livelihood and its own production brought in 250 yuan or more .
Although it exploited others by collecting interests , its annual interest income was only 29 yuan , which was under 15 percent of its total income .
After expenses , it had a surplus and it lived fairly well .
Nevertheless , as the amount of exploitation was not great , it is considered a well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasant , not a rich peasant , household .
( 2 ) A household of 5 members where 1 @-@ 1 / 2 members performed labor had 25 tan of land , actually producing 17 tan of grain .
It leased in 75 tan of land , actually producing 42 tan of grain and paying 25 tan in rent for 10 years .
Its annual income from sundry grain production and hog raising was 50 yuan .
It hired a shepherd boy for 3 years .
It loaned out 60 yuan large currency , at 30 percent interest , collecting 18 yuan per year for 4 years .
It had a 5 @-@ room house and one cow .
It had one parcel of wooded hill producing 30 tan of mu @-@ t &apos;ao a year .
Decision : The household depended mainly on its own labor for its livelihood .
Its annual exploitation of others was very small , only over 20 yuan ( combining employment of the shepherd boy and loans ) , while it was exploited by others in form of 25 tan of land rent .
After expenses , there was hardly any surplus .
Therefore , it is considered an ordinary middle peasant , not a well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasant , household .
The Time and Amount of Exploitation Practiced by the Rich Peasants
If a person , besides participating in production , relied on exploitation as a part , or a large part , of the source of livelihood of his household for 3 successive years immediately prior to the uprising , and if the exploitation amount exceeded 15 percent of the total annual income of the entire household , he is called a rich peasant .
Under certain conditions , though the exploitation amount exceeded 15 percent of the total income , if it did not exceed 30 percent , and if the masses do not oppose him , the party concerned is not a rich peasant , but a well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasant .
Attention must be given to the following
( 1 ) The time of the , uprising is the starting point to compute the time of exploitation by counting backward , and no other time may be used as the starting point for computation .
Some people reckon old accounts and take the interrupted exploitation of many years ago as the basis to determine the class classification .
This is incorrect .
( 2 ) Three successive years of exploitation constitute the time criterion to determine a rich peasant classification .
If the exploitation time did not exceed 3 years , or if it totaled 3 years but was intermittent ( not continuous ) , although the exploitation amount was the same as the rich peasants in the same period , the party concerned is still considered well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasant .
( 3 ) The exploitation amount must have exceeded 15 percent of the total annual household income before the party concerned is classified as a rich peasant .
If the exploitation amount was below 15 percent , although there was continuity of 3 years or more , the party concerned is not considered a rich peasant , but a well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasant .
( 4 ) The total annual household income indicates the total of a person &apos;s receipts from his own production and his exploitation of others .
If a certain household produced by its own effort 400 yuan and received 100 yuan by exploitation , the 500 yuan , total was the total income .
As the exploitation income constituted 20 percent of the total income , the party concerned is a rich peasant .
( 5 ) The &quot; certain conditions &quot; indicate cases where the family members were numerous , the labor force small and its living condition not luxurious , or , where it encountered difficulties due to natural disasters or human calamities .
Under such conditions , although the exploitation amount exceeded 15 percent , if it did not exceed 30 percent , and if the masses do not oppose it , it is considered a well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasant household .
Here , the opinion of the masses is extremely important , and consideration of such cases must be extremely careful .
The well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants must not be mistaken for rich peasants , causing the dissatisfaction of the middle
peasants , nor must the rich peasants be mistaken as well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants , causing the dissatisfaction of the poor peasants .
Therefore , careful consideration and the consent of the masses are required .
There have been many disputes on the issues of time and amount in the land investigation movement , because of the lack of a clear distinction between the rich peasants and the well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants , so far .
The well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants are sometimes handled as rich peasants , or vice versa .
There have been frequent disputes .
Now , with the provision on their demarcation , such disputes can be avoided .
Examples :
( 1 ) A household of 11 members in which 2 of them performed labor owned 160 tan of land , actually producing 120 tan of grain ( worth 480 yuan ) .
They had 2 parcels of tea hills , producing 30 yuan large currency annually .
They had a pond , producing 15 yuan large currency annually .
Their income from sundry grain production and hog raising was approximately 150 yuan per year .
They hired one permanent helper for 7 years , until the time of the revolution , thus exploiting approximately 70 yuan of surplus labor a year .
They loaned 250 yuan large currency , at 30 percent interest , collecting 75 yuan a year , for 5 years , until the time of the revolution .
A son of the household who is a scholar , wrote petitions and handled litigation and relied on his superiority to take advantage of others .
.Decision : While this household had two members performing labor , they hired permanent help and loaned out much money .
Their exploitation income exceeded 15 percent of the total annual hosehold income .
Although the members were numerous , the household had much surplus money after expenses .
Therefore , they are a rich peasant household and entitled to inferior land .
The evil gentry in the household is not entitled to any land .
( 2 ) A household of three members in which one &quot; of them was able to perform major labor for 4 months in the year had 60 tan of land , farmed 30 tan , actually producing 18 tan of grain , and rented out 30 tan , collecting 12 tan of grain as rent for 5 years .
It regularly hired part @-@ time help for 20 days a year .
It had one cow and could earn 2 tan of grain a year from it .
It loaned out 120 yuan large currency , at 30 percent interest , collecting 36 yuan a year , for 3 years .
Decision : The exploitation income of this household exceeded the receipts from its own production .
Nevertheless , as one member performed 4 months of major labor . , it is considered a rich peasant household and entitled to inferior land .
Reactionary Rich Peasants
The rich peasants who were guilty of serious counterrevolutionary conduct around the time of the uprising , especially after the uprising , are called reactionary rich peasants .
The land and assets of such reactionary rich peasants and of their family members who participated in such counterrevolutionary conduct must be confiscated .
The above provision is applicable to reactionary capitalists .
Attention must be given the following
( 1 ) Only the rich peasants guilty of &quot; serious counterrevolutionary conduct &quot; are called reactionary rich peasants .
Reactionary rich peasants lead the Civil League during the uprising to massacre the workers and peasants : resisted the revolutionary government , especially leading others to organize counterrevolutionary groups or organs after the uprising or performed serious counterrevolutionary activities individually , including assassination , serving as an enemy spy , volunteering as a guide to the White army9 fleeing to the White area in aid of the Kuomintang , actively sabotaging the land investigation movement and economic construction , etc .
In regard to those who are rich peasants and who were guilty of serious counterrevolutionary conduct , after verification , their land and assets are confiscated .
As for those rich peasants who were guilty of counterrevolutionary conduct but who were not leaders or performed no important activities , their land and assets must not be confiscated .
( 2 ) In regard to the family members of the reactionary rich peasants , only the land and assets of those who participated in the serious counterrevolutionary conduct are confiscated , but the land and assets of other members are not confiscated .
( 3 ) Those who temporarily went to the White areas for the purpose of making a living are not considered reactionary rich peasants , and their assets must not be confiscated .
However , in regard to those who went to the White areas because they did not wish to reside in the Soviet areas and remained in the White areas for 1 full year or more , although they are not reactionary rich peasants , their assets must be confiscated .
( 4 ) The above provisions are applicable in defining and handling the reactionary capitalists .
In many areas in the past , the land and assets of many rich peasants who were not guilty of serious counterrevolutionary conduct including the land and assets of their family members who did not participate in any counterrevolutionary conduct were confiscated .
This was erroneous .
The source of the error was Article 3 of Kiangsi &apos;s Land Confiscation and Distribution Law : &quot; In regard to the rich peasants who joined counterrevolutionary organizations ( such as the AB League , the Social Democratic Party , etc . ) * the entire household is confiscated , &quot; without distinction of principal or accessory , participant or non @-@ participant .
In regard to family members , the second half of the same article states : &quot; In regard to family members who did not join any counterrevolutionary organization , were not guilty of any counterrevolutionary conduct and have severed relations with the counterrevolutionaries in the family , when they are not opposed by the masses , their land may be returned to them . &quot; Nevertheless , because all the assets of the family have been confiscated , to return a portion afterward is still not the correct answer .
Therefore , the article in question must be revised according to these provisions .
In some areas in the past , the sphere of reactionary capitalists was expanded , and certain stpres which should hot have been confiscated were confiscated .
This was also wrong .
Example :
A household of nine members where one member performed labor and another incidental labor had 160 tan of land , farmed 80 tan and actually produced 45 tan of grain , and rented out 80 tan of land and collecting 40 tan of rent for 10 years .
They had five parcels of hills , producing 70 yuan large currency a year .
They had one permanent helper .
They owed 425 yuan large currency , at 25 percent interest , for 3 years .
They loaned out 380 yuan large currency , at 30 percent interest , for 5 years .
One member served as a company commander of the Ching @-@ wei League for 2 years and fought the Red Guard five times .
Another was a member of the AB League for 6 months , but not in an important position , and confessed to the government .
Other members of the family had @-@ no apparent reactionary conduct .
Decision : The classification of this household is rich peasant .
The one member who performed serious counterrevolutionary work is a reactionary rich peasant , and his assets must be confiscated .
The assets of other members must not be confiscated .
In regard to the member who joined the AB League , as he did not have an important position and he had confessed , nor must his assets be confiscated .
Rich Peasant Donations
Under the policy of weakening , the rich peasants , during the period of the domestic war , besides such basic means as allocating inferior land to them , confiscating their surplus buildings , plow animals and farm tools and levying higher taxes , to demand unscheduled donations from them is proper .
Nevertheless , the amount of &apos;donation must not exceed 40 percent of a rich peasant &apos;s cash on hand .
The number of times of donations must also be limited .
( 1 ) Recently , there have been two tendencies in regard to rich peasant donations .
One is to shelter the rich peasants and not ask them for donations .
Another is to take all their cash as a donation , which is no different from fines imposed on the landlords .
Both are incorrect and the latter is a tendency to eliminate the rich peasants and may even affect the middle peasants .
The limit has now been set at 40 percent .
All areas may , according to the rich peasants1 payment of donations in the past and their current family situation , ask them to donate a suitable portion of their cash .
( 2 ) Donations are of a temporary nature , different from the regular land tax .
The number of times of donations therefore , must be limited .
The rich peasants must not be asked to donate over and over again , without limit .
( 3 ) The authority to ask for donations from the rich peasants is limited to the state financial organs .
No other organ may ask them for donations .
The Land , Buildings , Plow Animals and Farm Tools to Which the Rich Peasants Are Entitled
After the land , buildings , plow animals and farm tools have been decided as assets to which the rich peasants are entitled , the rich peasants , provided they observe the laws of the Soviet , have the right of disposal , and no one may interfere .
Only for the purpose of facilitating production and with the consent of the rich peasants , may the workers , peasants and poor people exchange buildings with the rich peasants .
( 1 ) Recently in some areas , there have been incidents of workers , peasants and poor people exchanging their own land , .building , plow animals and farm tools for those to which the rich peasants are entitled , or @-@ even for clothes and fertilizer .
This is wrong , because there must be a limit to &quot; weakening the rich peasants . &quot; The &quot; weakening &quot; policy of allocating relatively inferior land , confiscating surplus buildings , plow animals and farm tools , levying higher taxes and demanding a part of their cash as donations has been enforced .
Anything beyond such limit is a tendency to destroy the rich peasants , which is improper in the current stage of the revolution .
Only for the purpose of facilitating production and with the consent of the rich peasants may buildings be exchanged .
( 2 ) After the correct solution of the land issue , when the inferior land allocated to a rich peasant has been improved into good land , no one may ask for its exchange .
( 3 ) The plow animals , farm tools and buildings acquired by the rich peasants after the arising , although there may be a surplus , must not be confiscated again or exchanged .
Rich Peasants &apos; Volunteer Labor
The rich peasants must perform more volunteer labor than the workers , peasants and poor people for the state and the locality , but such volunteer labor must be so limited as not to interfere with their production .
There must be a distinction between compelling the rich peasants to perform volunteer labor and compelling the landlords to do so .
All the able @-@ bodies among the landlords must be organised into the labor team for training and participation in the state and local labor work , thus reforming their class essence in the process of labor and eliminating the landlord class .
The rich peasants must perform more volunteer labor than the workers , peasants and poor people , but they must not be ordered to perform unlimited volunteer labor similar to the landlord so as to hinder their production .
Therefore , where the rich peasants and the landlords are organized into one labor team , in the busy farming season , when the rich peasants have no surplus labor power nor the means to compensate for the lack , it is wrong to make @-@ them perform long @-@ term volunteer labor severed from production .
Where production is not hindered , where.the rich peasants have surplus labor power , or where there are means of compensating for the lack , this provision does not apply .
Bankrupt Landlords
Landlords who lost all , or the greater part , of their land or assets used for exploitation before the uprising , but who still performed no labor , relying on fraud , plunder , or the help of relatives and friends for their main source of income are called bankrupt landlords .
The bankrupt landlords are still a part of the landlord class and may not be allocated land .
However , those landlords who , after bankruptcy , relied on their own labor for the main source of their income for 1 year or more must have their classification changed .
They have the right to land allocations .
Those landlords who , after bankruptcy , relied on their own labor for one @-@ third of their annual living expenses may be treated as rich peasants .
Calling partially bankrupt landlords bankrupt landlords is incorrect , because they still possessed a part of their assets to be used for exploitation .
Only the amount of their exploitation income had changed .
Calling bankrupt those landlords who performed major labor for 1 full year or more after bankruptcy is even more incorrect , because , after having performed major labor for 1 full year ( before the uprising ) , an individual changed from a landlord to a worker , poor man , or peasant .
To treat those landlords who performed partial labor after bankruptcy still as landlords is also incorrect , because , if such labor was sufficient to supply one @-@ third of their annual living expenses , they should be treated as rich peasants .
Poor People
Except the workers , peasants , independent producers and those following freelance occupations , all those depending on their labor to pursue one or more occupations , relying mainly on their own labor to make a living , or operating their own business with a small capital for the minimum living , are called poor people .
The unemployed poor in the villages and small towns must be allocated land .
The urban poor having no houses must be allocated the houses of the landlords .
The urban poor constitute a large portion of the population .
A part of them are also found in the rural villages and small towns .
Their occupations are complex .
The occupation of some individuals changes with the season and is indefinite .
Their life is very difficult .
Their income often cannot meet expenses .
Poor people operating their own business with a small capital are peddlers .
Physicians , teachers , lawyers , news reporters , authors and artists who did not exploit others are &quot; people who follow free @-@ lance occupations .
Intellectuals
( 1 ) The intellectuals , by themselves , do not constitute a class .
Their class classifications are determined according to the class they belong to .
( 2 ) Provided they observe the laws of the Soviet , all landlord and bourgeois intellectuals must be fully utilized for service to the Soviet .
( 3 ) Intellectuals who performed non @-@ exploiting work , such as teachers , editors , news reporters , service personnel , authors and artists , are mental laborers .
They must receive the protection of the laws of the Soviet .
( 1 ) The unconditional rejection of intellectuals in many areas recently is incorrect .
Utilizing the landlord and bourgeois intellectuals to serve the Soviet is beneficial to the Soviet revolutionary policy .
During the time when they serve the Soviet , means must be found to solve their living problems .
( 2 ) The class classification , of an intellectual is determined by the class to which he belongs .
For instance , an intellectual with a landlord background is a landlord .
One with a rich peasant background is a rich peasant .
One with a middle peasant background is a middle peasant .
It is incorrect to regard the intellectuals as a class by themselves .
It is even more incorrect to consider peasant children who have attended school ( the so @-@ called &quot; graduates &quot; ) as undesirables .
( 3 ) It is also wrong to regard the work of teachers as non @-@ labor .
Lumpen Proletariats
Workers , peasants and others who , immediately before the uprising , lost their jobs or land as a result of oppression and exploitation by the landlords and bourgeoisie and relied on improper means for the main source of their livelihood continuously for 3 years or more are called lumpen proletariat ( customarily known as vagrants ) .
The policy of the Soviet on the lumpen proletariat is to win the masses and oppose the leaders and those who depended on the exploiting class and actively participated in the counterrevolution .
The main means to win the lumpen proletariat masses is to make them return to production , to allocate land and jobs to them similar to the revolutionary people in general , and to give them voting rights .
Nevertheless , in order to receive land allocations , they must live in the rural village and have the ability to farm .
Attention must be given to the following
( 1 ) The &quot; improper means as the main source of livelihood &quot; indicate such improper occupations as stealing , robbing , swindling , begging , gambling and prostitution .
It is incorrect to refer to all those who were employed or semi @-@ employed but spent a part of their time on .
improper occupations ( not as the main source of their livelihood ) as vagrants .
It is even more incorrect to refer to the workers , peasants .and poor people who once had undesirable habits ( such as visiting prostitutes , gambling , smoking opium , etc . ) as vagrants .
( 2 ) In some areas , the lumpen proletariat leaders ( vagrant chiefs ) who actively participated in the counterrevolution are not only not punished , but allocated land .
This is wrong .
Other areas refuse the demand of the general lumpen proletariat for land allocations .
This is also wrong .
Professional Religionists
All those who followed the occupation of religious superstition for 3 full years ( immediately before the uprising ) , including ministers , Catholic fathers , monks , Taoist priests , vegetarians , geomancers , fortune @-@ tellers and diviners , are professional religionists .
Professional religionists have no voting right and may not receive land allocations .
All those who followed the occupation of religious superstition but did not depend on it as the main source of their livelihood , and all those who depended on it as the main source of their livelihood for less than 3 years , must not be called professional religionists .
They must be treated according to their proper classifications .
They must not be all deprived of their voting right or withheld land allocations .
In other words , all those practicing religious superstition as a sideline , or as their main occupation for less than 3 years , who were mainly workers , peasants , or poor people , they must retain their voting rights and those residing in.the rural village must receive land allocations .
This provision naturally applies to their family members as well .as themselves .
It is incorrect to refer to monks , Taoist priests , geomancers and fortune @-@ tellers as vagrants .
Red Army Soldiers With Landlord or Rich Peasant Background and Land Allocation
Under the condition of firmly waging war in the interest of the workers and peasants , Red Army members of landlord or rich peasant background , they , whether officers or soldiers and their family members have the right to receive land allocations .
( 1 ) Article 1 of the Regulations on the Preferential Treatment of Red Army Members states : &quot; In regard to all the Red Army soldiers whose families reside in Soviet areas , the soldiers themselves and their family members must all receive equal allocations of land , houses , woods and ponds similar
to the local impoverished peasants . &quot; Here , all Red Army soldiers are included .
Nevertheless , recently , some areas only looked into the social background , without regard , of the political manifestations and repossessed the &apos; land already allocated to Red Army soldiers .
This was incorrect .
( 2 ) &quot; Family members of Red Army soldiers &quot; include the father , mother , wife , sons , daughters and younger brothers and sisters under 16 years of age .
Wo one else may enjoy this privilege .
( 3 ) In regard to Red Army soldiers of landlord or rich peasant background , if they are expelled from the army , their land may be repossessed .
Workers Who Belong to Rich Peasant or Landlord Families
Where a worker belongs to a rich peasant or .landlord family , the classification of the worker himself and his wife is unchanged .
Whether he should receive land allocation depends on whether he is in the village or the city and handled accordingly .
Other members of his family are handled as landlord or rich peasants .
( 1 ) In a landlord or rich peasant family , anyone selling his labor for 1 full year or more immediately prior to the uprising is recognized as a worker .
He and his wife are treated as workers .
His part of the family assets is not confiscated .
If he and his wife reside in the village , they will receive land allocations , but no such allocation will be made if they reside in the city .
Where the individual himself resides in the city while his wife resides in the village , &apos; he will not be allocated land , while his wife will be .
Other members of the family are handled as landlord or rich peasants and may not enjoy the rights of workers .
Should there be members of other classifications in the family , they are handled according to such classifications .
( For instance , if someone in the family residing in the village relied on rent collection and loans as the main source of his livelihood for 3 full years or more * he is a landlord .
Someone who had been selling his labor for 1 full year or more is a worker .
Someone who had been operating his small handicraft store in a township for 1 full year or more is an independent producer .
Their classifications are determined according to the source of their livelihood within a certain period of time , , and their treatment under the soviet laws is determined according to their classifications ) .
( 2 ) The rural workers , independent producers , elementary school teachers and physicians who owned small parcels of land and rented them out because they had to go elsewhere to make a living , being unable to do so in their home village , but did not rely on the rental income as the main source of their livelihood , will receive land allocations similar to the peasants in general .
They must not be regarded as landlords .
The Class Classification of Landlords , Rich Peasants , or Capitalists Marrying Workers and Peasants
( 1 ) The act of marriage does not change the class classification .
( 2 ) The class classifications of landlord , rich peasants ; or capitalists marrying workers , peasants , or poor people are determined by whether the marriage occurred before or after the uprising , the original class classifications and the living conditions after marriage .
( 3 ) In regard to those who married before the uprising : Women of landlord , rich peasant , or capitalist families who married workers , peasants , or poor people and performed labor for 1 full year or more are recognized as peasants or poor people .
Those who did not perform labor , or who performed labor for less than a full year , will retain their original classi- &apos; fication without change .
Women.of worker , peasant , or .
poor people families who married landlords , rich peasants , or capitalists are only classified as landlords , rich peasants , or capitalists if they lived the same kind of life as the landlords , rich peasants , or capitalists for 5 full years .
If they did not live the same kind of life as the landlords , rich peasants9 or capitalists , but lived the life of workers , peasants , or poor people ( relying on their own labor as the main source of their livelihood ) , or if they lived the same kind of life as the landlords , r , ich peasants , or capitalists for less than 5 years , their original classifications are unchanged .
( 4 ) In regard to those who married after the uprising : .. The classifications of women of worker , peasant , or poor people families marrying landlords , rich peasants , or capitalists are unchanged .
In case of women of landlord , .
rich peasant , or capitalist families marrying workers , peasants , or poor people , they must have performed labor for 5 full years before they are recognized as workers , peasants , or poor people .
If they performed no labor , or performed labor for less than 5 full years , their original classifi- ^ cations will remain unchanged .
( 5 ) Regardless of the time of marriage and the classifications of the parents , the classification of the children follows that of the father .
( 6 ) The enjoyment of land and public rights depends on .
the classification .
( 7 ) Women of landlord , rich peasant , or capitalist families marrying -workers , peasants , or poor people may not be organized into the labor team .
Where the cash dowry was under 50 yuan , they may not be fined or assessed donations .
( 8 ) In case of worker , peasant , or poor people daughters sold as child @-@ brides to landlords , rich peasants , or capitalists , or in case of worker , peasant , or poor people families acquiring a husband into the family for their daughter from the landlord , rich peasant , or capitalist families , or vice versa , prior to the uprising , the provisions contained in ( 1 ) to ( 7 ) above are applicable to the classification and treatment of the children sold and the husbands acquired .
( 9 ) Where , before the uprising , the workers , peasants , or poor people gave their sons to the landlords , rich peasants , or capitalists as heirs , or vice versa , regardless of the age of the children at the time of transfer , the classification of those children under 10 years of age will remain unchanged .
From age 10 on , where the sons of workers , peasants , or poor people were given to the landlords , rich peasants , or capitalists , if such children lived the same kind of life as their foster parents for 5 full years , their classifications are the same as the foster parents .
If their way of living was not the same as their foster parents , but the same as their natural parents , their original classifications are not changed .
Where the sons of landlords , rich peasants , or capitalists were given to workers , peasants , or poor people as heirs , if they lived the same kind of life as their foster parents for 3 full years , their classifications are the same as the foster parents .
If their way of living was not the same as their foster parents , but the same as their natural parents , their original classifications .are .unchanged.
&quot; Labor &quot; in the foregoing provisions includes household labor .
Landlords and Rich Peasants Who Were Also Merchants
( 1 ) In case of landlords who were also merchants , their land and their buildings and assets adjacent to the land are confiscated .
Their business and their stores , residences and assets adjacent to the business are not confiscated .
( 2 ) In case of rich peasants who were also merchants , their land and their buildings and assets &apos;adjacent to the land are handled &apos;according to the rich peasant classification .
Their business and their stores , residences and assets adjacent to the business are not confiscated .
( 3 ) The fines and donations of1 landlords and rich peasants who -were also merchants are limited to the landlord and rich peasant portion of their assets , and must not include the business portion .
( 4 ) Merchants are not organized into the labor team .
Managing the Public Hall
Managing the public hall was a kind of exploitation , but managing by the landlords , rich peasants , or capitalists must be distinguished from managing by the workers , peasants , or poor people .
Managing the public hall refers to managing the land and assets of all kinds of ancestral halls , temples , or associations .
Undoubtedly , managing the public hall was a kind of exploitation , especially in case of the landlords and rich peasants who provided public halls and concentrated large amounts of land and assets , making it one of the main forms of exploitation .
The fact that a few individuals controlled a public hall and collected large sums of exploitation is a factor in determining the class classification of the managers .
Nevertheless , the fact that some small public halls were managed by the worker , peasant , or poor people masses by rotation , and the amount of
exploitation was very small will not serve as a factor in determining the class classification of the managers .
It is incorrect to regard all those who managed the public hall as landlords , rich peasants , or capitalists .
The Living Problem of Some Work Personnel
Where the work personnel of the soviet organs or other revolutionary organizations have not been allocated land and experience difficulty in their livelihood , they and the members of their families may be allocated a suitable amount of land , or have their difficulties solved by some other means .
In regard to the livelihood of the Soviet work personnel in general who have been allocated land , the Central Government has issued an order to solve their difficulties ( by activating the masses to cultivate their land ) .
The provision here refers to the personnel who have not been allocated land .
Family members include father , mother , wife , sons , daughters and younger brothers and sisters under 16 years of age .
Public Enterprise Land
In regard to land division in new areas and redivision of land uncovered in the old areas , a suitable amount of land must be reserved for public enterprises such as bridges , ferries , tea pavilions and agricultural experimental farms .
In regard to the funds to maintain the public enterprises , sueh .
as bridge repair , ferry boat repair , wages for the boatmen and tea pavilion repair and installation , a suitable amount of land must be reserved and the masses activated to cultivate it .
In addition , the country , district and township Soviets must reserve some land in a suitable location near the government organs for agricultural experimental farms .
( The pounty soviet may reserve 50 to 150 tan , the district soviet 15 to 25 tan , and the township soviet 5 to 10 tan . ) Before the agricultural experimental farm is started , the land may be leased to the peasants for cultivation at a nominal rental .
Debts
( 1 ) Where landlords , rich peasants , or capitalists loaned money or articles @-@ to the workers , peasants , or poor people before the uprising , except for goods received from the stores , the principal and interest are both cancelled .
Where workers , peasants , or poor people deposited money or articles with the landlords , rich peasants , or capitalists , the principal and interest must be paid according to the actual figures .
( 2 ) Those who relied exclusively or mostly on exploitation by high interest loans for the main source of the livelihood of the household are called usurers .
The usurers are handled in the same manner as landlords .
( 3 ) Provided the Provisional Loan Law promulgated by the Central Government is not violated , debts incurred after the uprising must be repaid .
Those who were guilty of exploitation by high interest loans ( in all areas .
controlled by the Kuomintang , whether urban or &apos;rural , the great majority of the debts are exploitation by high interest loans ) but who did not rely exclusively or mostly on such loans for the main source of the livelihood of the household cannot be called usurers and the policy of total confiscation does not apply .
They must be handled individually according to their classifications .
It is &quot; incorrect to classify all those guilty of exploitation by high interest loans as &quot; usurers . &quot; In regard to those who loaned and borrowed money at the same time , their &quot; credit &quot; and &quot; debit &quot; must be offset and the nature and extent of the balance studied .
Then , by adding such balance to his other exploitations , his classification is determined .

RESOLUTION ON THE REPROMULGATION OF THE LABOR LAW 15 October 1933
&#91; Text &#93; According to experience gained after 18 months of implementing the Labor Law promulgated 1 December 1931 , some provisions of the Labor Law were out of keeping with actual conditions in the Soviet Area and the Law did not provide for measures to accommodate the middle and poor peasants and handicraft workers who employ auxiliary labor .
As a result , there were difficulties in enforcing the Law .
Moreover , the Law did not provide for many other practical matters .
Yet , these matters urgently needed to be included in the provisions of the Law .
With a view to improving the interests of the workers , consolidating the worker @-@ peasant alliance and developing the economy of the Soviet Area , the Central Executive Committee organized in April 1933 a Labor Law Drafting Committee to redraft a labor law .
For the past 5 months , through discussions of a new draft labor law by worker @-@ peasant masses in various places , numerous opinions were mustered .
In accordance with the draft labor law and the opinions gathered from various places , the Central Executive Committee examined the draft and made amendments .
Now it is especially resolved that
( 1 ) The articles of the Labor Law be adopted , promulgated and put into effect as from 15 October 1933 .
( 2 ) After the new Labor Law is promulgated , the Labor Law that went into effect 1 December 1931 be declared null and void .
All other decrees concerning the labor problem that contradict the provisions of the new Labor Law shall also be without legal force .
( 5 ) Detailed formalities to enforce the provisions of the new Labor Law be promulgated by order of the People &apos;s Council and the Central Department of the People &apos;s Commissioner of Labor .
( 4 ) Any amendments to this Labor Law be made by order of the Central Executive Committee .
( 5 ) This Labor Law take effect within the territory of the Chinese Soviet Republic .
( 6 ) All persons who violate the provisions of this Labor Law be punished in accordance with the provisions of the Regulations Governing Punishments for Violating the Labor Law promulgated by the Central Executive Committee 15 October 1933 .

EMERGENCY MOBILIZATION ORDER ISSUED BY THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FOR SMASHING THE FIETH &apos; ENCIRCLEMENT AND SUPPRESSION CAMPAIGN ?
18 October 1933
&#91; Text &#93; The large @-@ scale decisive battle to smash the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; of the enemy has begun !
We are striving for an even greater victory !
After sustaining an initial serious blow to its large @-@ scale invasion in Ch &apos;ing @-@ liu , Lien @-@ ch &apos;eng , Yang k &apos;ou , Wu @-@ chiang and Li @-@ chruan , the imperialist Kuomintang is frantically waging a desperate attack .
This engagement is a crucial moment in the decisive battle between the two roads of sovietism and colonialism !
To mobilize all our strength and fight for a way out for the Soviet and to strive for our complete victory in this decisive battle are the crucial tasks of the Soviet regime at present .
The result of an inspection by the Central Government of the work of the Soviets at different levels , however , revealed that many local governments displayed an attitude of extreme unconcern toward war mobilization .
Manifestations of enthusiasm for enlarging the Red Army , enlarging and training regional armed forces and mobilizing transport teams to go to the front recently were utterly lacking in many places .
People in many places did not link all kinds of workland investigation campaign , economic development , cultural and educational work and sovietizationclosely with the mobilization for revolutionary war so as to really rally the masses and lead them to struggle for the sake of complete victory in smashing the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot;
Because a number of local governments adopted an attitude of unconcern , even negligence , toward war mobilization , the following serious incidents came about recently .
On the northern front a small unit of the enemy dared to penetrate deeply into the Yung @-@ feng and Pei ^ k &apos;eng soviet area and raided the district government , and on the southern front enemy scouts infiltrated into the vicinity of Yun @-@ men @-@ ts &apos;en in search of military intelligence .
Yet our district and township governments were completely unaware beforehand .
In Fukien Province , this July , preparations to fight for victory at Lien @-@ ch ? eng in coordination with the Red Army were utterly insufficient and efforts made
after victory to win over the new area of Lien @-@ ch &apos;ing @-@ kuei were extremely slow .
In Fukien and Kiangsi provinces , more than 300 rifles were unexpectedly intercepted and seized by the enemy recently .
At the front there are not enough coolies to move the large quantities of war booty and recently a great deal of rifles taken from the enemy at Li @-@ ch &apos;uan had to be moved entirely by fighters of the Red Army .
For the people in these places to adopt such an attitude of unconcern and negligence toward maintaining vigilance against the enemy and toward war mobilization is virtually to commit a crime against the Revolution !
This is a phenomenon that cannot go on for even a short time longer !
It should be rectified at once .
Beginning with the date of receipt of this order , the governments at different levels should promptly carry out the following kinds of work :
Provincial , county , district , township governments and all units of the Red Army should forthwith convene all kinds of meetings , and particularly at election meetings of the Soviets , to explain in detail the tense present situation in the Revolutionary war and to use all their strength to proceed with mobilization for war .
Likewise , all kinds of mass organizations should convoke meetings to report on the war situation and their own roles so as to be certain that every worker and every peasant in the Soviet Area will understand the significance of this most important battle to smash the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; and come forward enthusiastically to carry out the work for participation in the war .
Bearing in mind the experience gained and lesson learned in our smashing of the fourth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; the government at different levels must fulfill the plan of the Central Revolutionary Military Affairs Committee to enlarge the Red Army and enthusiastically rally whole battalions and whole companies of the Red Guards and Young Pioneers to join the Red Army before the decisive battle to smash the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; At the same time , they must separately rally large numbersof brave activists to join the Red Army .
They should carry on the experience of the Red month of May and perpetuate the splendor of the Red month of May to enlarge the Red Army sharply .
At the same time , they should apply the experience of Hsing @-@ kuo County &apos;s rejoin @-@ one &apos;s @-@ regiment campaign and make all deserters return to the army .
The governments at different levels must rally citizens between the ages of 18 and 40 to join the Red Guards of their own free will in large number and the broad masses of workers and peasants to join the Young Pioneers .
They should revive and expand model Red Guards battalions and model Young Pioneers organizations , send them down regularly for drilling and step up their military and political training .
Where no model Red Guards battalions and model Young Pioneers exist , they should be established in the shortest possible time .
Under a unified plan of operations ( to be decided by military organs ) , they should rally the Red Guards and Young Pioneers to engage
in battle in coordination with the Red Army .
Under the orders of the Military Affairs Committee , all guerrilla units must thrust deeply into the rear of the enemy in order to pin down enemy forces and then attack them .
The governments at different levels must assure the supply of materials to the Red Army .
Every single item of economic development should be linked closely with the war .
They must also rally the broad masses to complete selling of economic development work before the end of December and begin levying the land tax in November and be through with it within 2 months .
The governments at different levels must intensify the work of fund raising and particularly in the new areas and border areas .
The equalization bureau and trade bureau of the governments at different levels must use all their strength to insure the supplies of the Red Army so that the difficulties of the spring @-@ summer period this year in procuring staple foods for the Red Army will not arise again and affect its movement .
It is imperative that the worker @-@ peasant masses be mobilized to stand ready to render economic aid to the Red Army at all times .
The governments at different levels should , in accordance with the Voluntary Labor Law promulgated by the Central Government , .mobilize the broad masses to take up transport work .
Every member of the Red Guards should have a carrying pole and a bedspread , and five of them should together have a stretcher .
As soon as they hear a command from the government , they will be able to assemble immediately to undertake transport work and help to attack the enemy .
And when the route of communication is damaged , they must immediately make repairs so as to facilitate the movement of the Red Army .
The governments at different levels must especially step up the work of suppressing counterrevolutionaries and enforcing the Red state of siege .
Counterrevolutionary cases should be rapidly resolved within a few weeks and escape of prisoners should be done away with .
Sentry posts must be set up so as to tighten up the inspection of safe conduct passes .
In the border areas , it is even more essential ; -to guard against any surprise attack by enemy plainclothes corps .
The necessary alarm signal should be set up according to the orders of the Military Affairs Committee .
The governments at different levels must pay attention to work in the border areas and new areas and transfer the most capable cadres there to work .
In the new areas occupied by the Red Armys they should immediately strive to establish provisional regimes , distribute land , build up regional armed forces and bring into existence various mass revolutionary organizations .
The departments of worker @-@ peasant prosecutors at different levels must step up the prosecution of passive and bureaucratic elements who are sabotaging the work of war mobilization .
The departments of labor and the departments of education at different levels , in enforcing the Labor Law and carrying out cultural and educational work respectively , should link up their functions closely with the work of war mobilization .
All sovietization work should be subordinate to the war !
In the great and difficult battle immediately before us , it is necessary to deal a severe &quot; blow to alarm and to retreat and escape .
At the same time , it is necessary to oppose resolutely all suggestions of taking enemy attacks lightly and relaxation our efforts in mobilization work .
It is imperative that we make a supreme effort to tighten up all Qur work and plunge into propaganda and agitation to mobilize the broad masses of workers and peasants , concentrate all our strength , prepare to make all sacrifices , and fight for total victory in smashing the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression campaign &quot; : Fight for Soviet new China ! .
.
The governments at different levels must conduct the most detailed report and discussion of this order and the 5 October order of the Military Affairs Committee at various meetings and draw up the most concrete measures to implement these orders .
Stern administrative punishments should be meted out immediately to those who are either passive or remiss in implementing these orders .
Such is the order !

WORK REPORT OF THE PROVISIONAL CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OF THE CHINESE SOVIET REPUBLIC TO THE ELECTORATE ON THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF ITS ESTABLISHMENT
24 October 1933
&#91; Text &#93; Comrades of the Electorate !
Today is the second anniversary of the Provisional Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic since its establishment .
Last year this day we delivered a simple work report to you comrades .
On this second anniversary we ought to report briefly to you on the process of work in the past year .
We hope to receive your views about our work in the past and your suggestions regarding administrative guidelines for the future .
Comrades , under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the initiative @-@ of the broad masses of workers , peasants and toiling people as well as the courageous struggle of the worker @-@ peasant Red Army , the Provisional Central &quot; Government is moving forward victorious on all fronts .
The situation today is vastly different from that of a year ago .
Below we discuss these developments separately :
Victory in the Revolutionary War and Expansion and Strengthening of the Red Army
In the past year the central task in the revolutionary war was the smashing of the four &quot; encirclements and suppressions &quot; of the enemy .
This war resulted in our complete victory in the various soviet areas throughout the country .
According to incomplete statistics , during the past year upward of 100,000 troops of the White army were liquidated and an equal number of rifles were seized .
Statistics for the period from January to June show that altogether 41 regiments , 6 battalions and 10 companies of the White army were wiped out ; 8 divisions , 33 regiments , 19 battalions and 9 companies were routed ; over 31,700 rifles and 1,000 machine guns and automatic rifles were captured ; 20 divisional , brigade and regimental commanders were taken prisoner ; 2 divisional commanders were killed , and innumerable commanders from brigade commanders down were either killed or wounded .
Because of our magnificent victories , the rule of the imperialist Kuomintang began wavering to a considerable degree .
They had to organize five &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaigns to make desperate attacks against us .
We , relying on the Party &apos;s line on attack and on the bravery of the Red Army and enthusiastic support of the worker @-@ peasant masses in both soviet and White areas , dealt a telling blow to the enemy right from the beginning in all five of their &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaigns .
In the battles of Lien @-@ ch &apos;eng , Yang @-@ k &apos;ou , Wu @-@ chiang and more recently Li @-@ ch * uan , we won a victory and seized over 8,000 rifles .
In the past year , due to the fact that the worker @-@ peasant masses courageously came forward to join the Red Army , the Red Army has grown to twice its size of last year , and fighting heroically in many a bloody battle it has forged itself into a strong and invincible revolutionary &apos;army @-@ of iron .
The Red Guards , Young Pioneers and guerrilla units in various places have also been strengthened .
Under the leadership of the Soviet government , the worker @-@ peasant masses and the Red Army have smashed the enemy &apos;s &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaigns with revolutionary war .
This is the core of our revolutionary tasks .
Therefore , all our work and our livelihood are , therefore , subordinate to the revolutionary war .
To strive for victory in the war is the primary duty of every worker or peasant comrade in the soviet areas .
Sharp Expansion and Further Consolidation of the Soviet Areas
Since last year the Northeast Region of the Central Soviet Area has soviet @-@ ized the six counties of Chien @-@ ning , T &apos;ai @-@ nings Li @-@ ch &apos;uan , Kuang @-@ tse , Tzu @-@ ch &apos;i and Chin @-@ ch &apos;i to form an area contiguous to the Fukien @-@ Chekiang @-@ Kiangsi Soviet Area and there the new Fukien @-@ Kiangsi Province has been established .
The recent victory scored by the East Region army has placed a large area from the border between Lung @-@ yen and Hsin @-@ ch &apos;uan in Fukien &apos; Province through Lien @-@ ch &apos;eng , Ch &apos;ing @-@ liu and Kuei @-@ hua to the vicinity of Yen @-@ p &apos;ing in northern Fukien within the territorial limits of the Soviet .
In the course of smashing the enemy &apos;s fourth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign , Kiangsi Province added portions of territory , totaling several hundred square li in area , to each of the six counties of Nan @-@ feng , I @-@ huang , Ch &apos;ung @-@ jen , Lo @-@ an , Yung @-@ feng and Hsin @-@ kan .
As to soviet territory beyond the Central Soviet Area , such as the Fukien @-@ Chekiang @-@ Kiangsi , Hunan @-@ Kiangsi , Hunan @-@ Hupeh @-@ Kiangsi , Hunan @-@ Western Hupeh and Hupeh @-@ Honan @-@ Anhwei soviet areas , although there were small portions of territory which were temporarily occupied by the enemy , some were recovered shortly after and some even made new progress .
Making especially rapid progress on a broad front was the newly created soviet area in the northern part of Szechwan Province .
Owing to the heroic struggle of the Red Fourth Front Army there , in less than a year they have sovietized more than 10 counties and called on the worker @-@ peasant toiling masses and soldiers of the White army in the entire province of Saechwan to lean toward soviet revolution .
Elsewhere , in the provinces of Shensi , Honan , Hopeh , Kiangsu , Kwangtung and Kwangsi , there is in existence either a soviet area or a guerrilla area of ours .
In the Northeast Provinces , the broad masses of anti @-@ Japanese volunteer army forces are continuing to fight stubbornly against Japanese imperialism .
The soviet areas have not only grown , but also have been more consolidated .
For example , previous manifestations of shoddy implementation of the class line have , by and large , been rectified .
As a result of the realistic implementation of the Labor Law and promulgation of a new Labor Law , the economic life of the worker masses has been improved still more , the enthusiasm , of the workers in participating in the revolutionary war and soviet construction has been raised further and the class unions of the workers have been organized widely and have grown and progressed .
The extensive unfolding of the inspection of fields campaign has dealt the greatest blow to remnant feudalist influences in the soviet areas , heightened to an enormous degree the revolutionary potentialities of the toiling masses in rural areas and promoted poor peasants &apos; groups far and wide .
By relying on the development of the initiative of the worker @-@ peasant masses , we have attracted a great number of new worker @-@ peasant cadres to participating in soviet work and got rid of many of the bad elements hidden in the Soviets .
The leadership style and working style n the Soviets have been improved further and the Soviets are now linked even more closely with the masses .
This year the administrative area of a soviet has been reduced n size .
This move enables the soviet to come even closer in the system to the masses .
In the light of experience gained in past soviet election campaigns and soviet work , the Central Government promulgated a new Election Law and Organic Law of Local Soviets , making it possible for this yearTs election campaign to be unfolded even more correctly an &apos;d for local Soviets to be organized even better .
All this has made the soviet a government in which the masses truly manage their own affairs .
It has made this government meet the needs of the revolutionary war to become an organizer as well as a leader of the revolutionary war .
Because of splendid victories of the Red Army and the development and consolidation of the soviet areas , on the one hand , and , on the other , the total capitulation of the Kuomintang government to imperialism as a result of the occupation of the Northeast Provinces , Jehol Province and North China by Japanese imperialism and the economic catastrophe in the Kuomintang areas , the broad masses of workers , peasants and toiling people , revolutionary soldiers and revolutionary students in the Kuominfcang areas have been aroused and oppose as one Japanese imperialism and all imperialists , the Kuomintang government and landlords and capitalists .
Revolutionary struggles are unfolding in vast areas throughout the country .
The exploited and oppressed masses in the whole of China enthusiastically support the Soviet and the Red Army because the Soviet and the Red Army are the only government and military forces fighting for national freedom and independence and only the Soviet and the Red Army can save China .
Soviet Economic Construction and Cultural Construction
The bitter and protracted civil war demands that the Soviet pay maximum attention to undertakings for the development of the economy .
Concerning work in this respect , the Soviet is making great effort to carry it out .
Here the primary task is to develop agricultural production .
Thanks to the correct leadership of the Soviet and the heightening of the enthusiasm of
the broad masses of toiling people during spring cultivation and summer cultivation , the autumn harvest this year on the average increased one and a half times over last year .
The yield of miscellaneous grain crops registered an even bigger increase .
Cattle for plowing cooperatives and labor mutual aid societies have been established in a &apos;number of places .
There is only one kind of development which can insure the supplies of the Red Army and the masses and guarantee the exchange with the outside for industrial products , and that is a development that depends on agricultural production .
The development of industrial production is our second task in economic construction .
The production of farm implements and lime here is closely linked with the development of agricultural production .
The supply of a number of handicraft products for daily use depends upon our own production in the soviet areas .
In the past , cigarettes , paper , lumber , grass cloth , wolfram and camphor were produced and exported in large quantities , but later they went into a decline .
Since the beginning of the year , the Soviet has been planning to resore these industries and in some of them we have achieved initial success .
To develop an export and import trade is our third task in economic construction .
This year the government established the bureau of foreign trade , which has begun to work along this line .
For the purpose of carrying out the above @-@ mentioned tasks , we must develop cooperatives .
Since the Central Government got down to promoting the cooperative movement , consumers &apos; cooperatives and foodstuffs cooperatives have been spreading like a storm in various places .
The development of all kinds of producers1 cooperatives is also being planned , while the planning of credit cooperatives has just begun .
Economic construction bonds floated by the Central Government in order to launch economic construction are winning the support of the masses .
Bonds issued so far have exceeded 3 million yuan .
In all likelihood , the sum of 5 million yuan can be realized .
The development of the economic construction , will certainly provide the revolutionary war with a solid material basis and bring about further improvement in the livelihood of the broad masses of workers and peasants .
Comrades , let us work hard together !
The revolutionary war and soviet construction demand that we generally raise the cultural level of the worker @-@ peasant masses in the soviet areas .
Only under the Soviet.regime are the worker @-@ peasant masses able to enjoy the right to get an education .
In the past year , the Soviet has begun to get cultural and educational enterprises under way .
Primary schools , night schools , literacy movements and club campaigns have begun in various places .
The establishment of Marxism @-@ Communism University , Soviet University and Red Army University and the development of the worker @-@ peasant theatrical group and blue @-@ gown group movements , all show that the Soviet cultural construction undertakings have entered the stage of expansion .
Recently , the Central Government has proclaimed Marxism @-@ Communism to be the fundamental guideline of Soviet culture and education .
The Central Government is formulating a system of primary education and promulgating concrete measures to carry out social education .
To enable the laboring people in the soviet areas to acquire an education and to unfold a struggle on the cultural front have become an important portion of our task in Soviet construction .
Comrades of the electorate , in the foregoing paragraphs we have briefly reported on the situation of the development of the Revolution and on our progress and achievements in Soviet work .
Now , we want to point out to you comrades our deficiencies in Soviet work in the past and our tasks in the work from now on .
You , comrades of the electorate , must , under the correct leadership of the Soviet , make every effort to substantiate these deficiencies and realize these tasks before we can fight for the complete smashing of the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign and the victory of the Soviet throughout the country .
What are our tasks ?
Where do our deficiencies lie ?
First , expansion of the Red Army .
Comrades , although the Red Army has been enlarged , it is still not large enough .
.To defeat the vast forces of the white army in the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign , it is still necessary to expand the Red Army .
Every brave worker and every brave peasant ought to go to the front on their own initiative . &apos; For the sake of coordinating with the Red Army in fighting the enemy and defending their own localities at the same time , it is imperative that the Red Guards and Young Pioneers be expanded considerably and model &apos; Red Guards battalions and model Young Pioneers be increased in number .
The work of putting out sentries to check safe @-@ conducts must be tightened so as not to allow even one enemy scout to sneak into a soviet area under cover .
Transport teams must stand ready from time to time to go to the front to carry the wounded or move the spoils of war .
Second , work in new soviet areas should be unfolded even more rapidly .
Although in the past year @-@ we developed many new soviet areas , we still feel it is a little bit slow .
One reason for this is that we in the central area have not sent enough worker @-@ peasant activist comrades to work in the new soviet areas .
In order to expand the new soviet areas even more drastically in the fighting to smash the &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign , comrades in the central area should be delighted to go to work in the new soviet areas and comrades in the new soviet areas should redouble their efforts in performing their work .
Third , although we made great achievements in Soviet construction in the past year , there is still much work that remains to be done .
First of all , to protect the usual interests of the worker we must enforce the Labor Law even more generally and correctly .
Next , the land investigation movement .
We must make all possible efforts to launch movement and check up on classes in places where remnants of feudal influence have not yet been wiped out .
But we must not start a quarrel with middle peasants and treat rich peasants the same as landlords .
Then , economic construction .
We must strive for winter cultivation this year and prepare for spring cultivation next year .
We must develop the cooperatives so that they will @-@ have a membership of 1 million and set up central organizations of various consumers1 cooperatives at different levels to carry out the plan to engage in trade .
We must carry out the development of export and import trade to break the enemy &apos;s blockade and solve our salt difficulties .
We must repair bridges and roads so as to facilitate economic development .
We must sell effectively 3 to 5
million yuan worth of economic construction bonds &apos; to raise the capital for all kinds of economic construction undertakings .
Next is cultural construction .
We must establish a complete primary education system and unfold a campaign to eliminate illiteracy .
Then we must intensify the suppression of counterrevolutionaries @-@ so that not a single counterrevolutionary will remain in the soviet areas to take advantage of an enemy attack to create trouble in our interior .
Moreover , we must step , up fund raising so as to secure insurance for our war chest .
In order to realize rapidly the above tasks , it is necessary to eliminate thoroughly bureaucratism from among the working personnel of the soviet .
Comrades of the electorate should heed supervising the soviet personnel so that bureaucratism cannot exist .
It is necessary to see to.it that this year &apos;s election campaign will culminate in success so that a great many worker @-@ peasant activists will through their winning1 in the elections come to work in the soviet and clear out bureaucratic elements among members of the old administration .
In this way , the realization of the different combat tasks of the soviet will be assured .
Comrades of the electorate , every item of work mentioned above is a combat duty of ours and an indispensable prerequisite to smashing the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign of the enemy .
And as we make this report to you today , the enemy is attacking us in.force and we are concentrating our forces for a decisive battle against this enemy .
The fighting is getting to be extremely tense .
Our work , therefore , must .be tightened up to the highest degree .
The Central Government has promulgated an emergency war mobilization order to call upon the entire working personnel in the soviet to employ the spirit of shock troops to unfold their own work so as to make soviet work in its entirety meet with the demands of the frontline .
All members of the electorate must rally forthwith under this call of the Central Government .
Comrades , let us make use of this kind of work to exchange for final victory !
First of all , we would like to exchange for a great victory that will come before the opening of the Second National Congress of Soviets .
Comrades , let us dedicate such a victory to the Second National Congress of Soviets !
Expand the Red Army drastically !
Enlarge the soviet areas drastically !
Unfold soviet construction work in combat fashion !
Smash the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign of the imperialist Kuomintang !
Long live the Second National Congress of Soviets !
Long live Soviet China !

OPEN LETTER TO THE PEOPLE OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY ON &apos; DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND JAPAN&apos;
11 November 1933
&#91; Text &#93; People of the whole country !
Ever since the Kuomintang Nanking Government concluded an agreement with Japanese imperialism ( calling for the sale of Manchuria and Mongolia to Japan and a truce in North China and the holding of the Dairen Conference in which China , Japan and &quot; Manchukuo &quot; gathered for a &quot; social &quot; ) the Kuomintang Nanking government not only has sold off Manchuria and Mongolia and the so @-@ called &quot; neutral region &quot; of Lo @-@ tung , but also has directly mobilized its armed strength to force , in coordination with troops of Japanese imperialism and &quot; Manchukuo , &quot; anti @-@ Japanese Manchurian soldiers to withdraw from Mongolia .
It also has , under the name of &quot; suppression of bandits , &quot; massacred thousands of troops of the Northeast Anti @-@ Japanese.volunteer armies and revolutionary soldiers .
All over China , Chiang Kai @-@ sheks the ringleader of the Kuomintang , issued a blatant proclamation to the effect that &quot; people who talk wildly of resisting Japan will be summarily executed without leniency &quot; and that &quot; to extirpate the bandits it is necessary to stop resisting Japan . &quot; Then he proceeded to suppress all anti @-@ Japanese revolutionary movements with the most ruthless White terror , withdraw his North China garrisons according to plan and concentrate all his military might to launch a new , fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign against the anti @-@ Japanese and anti @-@ imperialist main forcethe Chinese Soviet Government and the Chinese Workers and Peasants1 Red Armyto demonstrate his loyalty to imperialism and realize his predetermined plan of holding &quot; direct negotiations between China and Japan . &quot;
Since key figures of the Kuomintang held their third Lu @-@ shan conference in September , direct negotiations between China and Japan have been carried out at an accelerated pace .
The scope of the negotiations obviously is not limited to the public acknowledgement of the Kuomintang government that Manchuria and Mongolia are colonies of Japanese imperialism .
In addition , it is certain that the Nanking government will be further submissive to Japan in its betrayal of the nation .
It will recognize North China as within the
sphere of influence of Japan in exchange for the latter &apos;s aid in money and arms to extend the reactionary influence of the Kuomintang government and carry out its fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign .
What is described as Japan &apos;s willingness to relinquish its &quot; extraterritoriality in China &quot; is , of course , nothing but a trick to hoodwink the Chinese people .
People of the whole country !
The Kuomintang Nanking Government has sold off the Northeast Provinces and Inner Mongolia .
Now it soon will sell off all of North China .
At the same time , the Kuomintang Nanking Government and the Kuomintang governments of various other factions have sold off Tibet , Sikang and the greater portions of Szechwan to British imperialism and nine islands in the South China Sea and Yunnan and Kweichow to French imperialism .
They also have sold off to British imperialism a multitude of political and economic privileges .
The big loan of several hundred million yuan and large quantities of murderous weapons @-@ that the Kuomintan Government has obtained from various imperialist countries in Europe and America were the price paid to it for selling out China .
Its sell @-@ out of the whole country , capitulation to imperialism and its serving as a scavenger of the imperialists in their partition of China have been the standing foreign policy of the Kuomintang government .
Precisely because of this , it is opposing all anti @-@ Japanese and anti @-@ imperialist revolutionary movements and carrying out its frenzied , desperate fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign against the only anti @-@ Japanese , anti @-@ imperialist , people &apos;s own Soviet Government and Workers and Peasants7 Red Army .
Precisely because of this , it is helping the imperialists to intensify the exploitation of the Chinese @-@ people and create the total breakdown of ChinaTs national economy so as to cause flood , drought and famine to spread widely over China , workers to lose their jobs , peasants to lose their land , students to lose their opportunity to attend school and the overwhelming majority of Chinese people to live in grievous and deplorable hell and eventually die of cold and hunger !
People of the whole country !
The road that the Kuomintang wants us to take is one that will lead to the conversion of China into a colony , one that will lead to the complete destruction of the Chinese nation !
The only way ahead for the revolutionary masses of the whole people is to unite as one , arm themselves , unfold a national revolutionary war against the invasion of Japanese imperialism and all other imperialism countries , overthrow all Kuomintang warlords who betray the country and bring shame on the nation , first of all , the principal cat &apos;s paw of the imperialist the Nanking Kuomintang government headed by Chiang Kai @-@ sbekand fight for the Chinese nation and the ultimate liberation of the Chinese people !
The Provisional Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic once more proclaims to the people of the whole country that for the sake of striking down Japan and all imperialists , overthrowing all traitorous Kuomintang
warlords and maintaining the independence , unity and territorial integrity of China , it stands ready at all times to shed the last drop of blood .
In order to maintain the independence , unity and territorial integrity of China , the Soviet Central Government is in the process of concentrating all its strength and preparing to make all sacrifices to smash the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign of the imperialist Kuomintang .
The struggle to smash the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign is a struggle to prevent China from taking the road of colonialism and struggle for a free and independent Soviet new China !
In order to concentrate all the strength of the people of the whole country to engage in a decisive battle against China &apos;s most vicious enemy , the Provisional Central Government and Revolutionary Military Affairs Committee of the Chinese Soviet Republic once again propose hereby to all armed units taking part in attacks against soviet areas throughout the country the conclusion of a combat agreement on the current anti @-@ Japanese and anti @-@ Chiang fighting under the following three conditions : ( 1 ) Cease all attacks against the soviet areas immediately ; ( 2 ) guarantee immediately the democratic rights of the people ( freedom of assembly , of association , of speech , of the press and of strike ) ; and ( 3 ) arm the people and create armed volunteers immediately to defend China and fight for its independence , unity and territorial integrity .
The Provisional Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic firmly believes that this proposal can win the sympathy and active support of the laboring masses of the whole country and all other Chinese people with even a slight amount of patriotic blood running in their veins .
Such sympathy and support will guarantee the total victory of the soviet road in the decisive battle between the two roads of colonialism and sovietism and enable the Chinese nation and people of the whole country to win ultimate liberation from the iron heels of imperialism !
Down with Japan and all other imperialists !
Down with the traitorous Kuomintang , the Nanking government and all other Kuomintang governments !
Struggle for an independent and free soviet new China !

ON THE AWOL PROBLEM IN THE RED ARMY
Order No .
25 of the Central Executive Committee
15 December 1933
&#91; Text &#93; Desertion is a sinister enemy of the Red Army and revolutionary war .
The struggle against desertion is an important work to insure the combat effectiveness of the Red Army .
In the past there was no uniform procedure to deal with the problem .
By this Order it is specially announced that
( 1 ) Those who desert with their rifles shall be summarily executed by shooting , without distinction , as soon as they are apprehended .
( 2 ) Those who organize desertion ( such as forging trip tickets ) and lead a squad , a platoon , or a company in desertion shall be executed by shooting , without distinction , after being apprehended and put on public trial .
( 3 ) Those who repeatedly desert and spread rumors to undermine the Red Army and the return @-@ to @-@ the @-@ army campaign shall be uniformly apprehended and handed over to the courts for sentencing to penal servitude for a limited term or execution by shooting .
( 4 ) What about those who desert individually for lack of political consciousness ?
The various governments shall intensify propaganda and agitation directed at them and organize work to extend preferential treatment to their family dependents , so that they will return to the army of their own free will .
The governments must in no way adopt measures of arrest and imprisonment .
Anyone who does shall be dealt with as having violated the laws of the Soviet .
( 5 ) If deserters stubbornly refuse to return to the army after having been subjected to propaganda and given explanations , the governments may , having obtained the countenance of the masses , require them to indemnify the state ( army uniform and blanket ) and the masses ( labor force expended in connection with giving preferential treatment to their family dependents ) for losses incurred , and strip them of the right to vote .
( 6 ) It is absolutely not permissible to harbor a deserter and let him work or serve in various organs , army units , and public bodies in the rear .
In case the deserter is harbored in an organ , then the responsible official of the organ in question shall be subject to punishment by demotion , dismissal , or imprisonment .
( 7 ) Those who fail to execute this order shall be dealt with as having aided and abetted desertion and undermined the Red Army .
( 8 ) This order shall come into force from the date of promulgation .

INVESTIGATION IN CHfANG @-@ KANG TOWNSHIP 15 December 1933
&#91; Text &#93; The actual implementation of all soviet work rests with the township and city Soviets .
Everyone understands this .
As to how the township and city Soviets should perform their work , many people do not understand .
Not understanding the work of the township and city Soviets will make it impossible to truly lead the work of the soviet or truly follow the principle that &quot; all soviet work must be subordinated to the demands of the revolutionary war . &quot; We have encountered the following situation among the work personnel of higher level Soviets .
They issue many orders and decisions , but they are ignorant of the practical work condition of any township or city soviet .
Comrades !
This won &apos;t do .
This is bureaucraticm , a hindrance to Soviet work !
Our tasks have been proposed , and many plans , from expanding the Red Army to building bridges and roads , have been published .
The question is how to mobilize the masses to carry out the tasks and plans completely and practically , The extraordinarily tense revolutionary war demands our prompt and general solution of this question .
Yet such a solution cannot be produced out of our mind .
We must collect all kinds of fresh and concrete experiences in the process of mobilizing the masses to implement the various tasks , bring such experiences to a greater light and expand our mass mobilization , in order to adapt ourselves to greater tasks and plans .
Currently , such serious errors as perfunctory performance of duty and coercion have occurred in the soviet organs of many areas .
The relationship between such Soviets and the masses is extremely bad , greatly hampering the implementation of the tasks and plans of the soviet .
On the other hand , innumerable lower level soviet work comrades in many areas have created excellent means to mobilize the masses .
Becoming one with the massess they have been very successful in their work .
One responsibility of the higher level soviet personnel is to collect and arrange such good experiences and spread them over a vast area .
This work must be started immediately in all the provinces and counties .
The most effective means against bureaucraticism is to demonstrate by live models .
Limited by time and the material of the informants , the experiences of Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township collected here only include a brief summary of the major items of their work .
Nevertheless , just such summary alone is sufficient to arouse our serious attention and make us solemnly praise their work as &quot; the model of Soviet work . &quot; As their relationship with the masses is extremely close , they have produced a great effect in their work .
Our goal is to bring to light such experiences and to collect more experiences to serve as concrete models to all the backward township and city Soviets , so that their work will be raised to the level of the advanced , rally millions of people around the soviet and adapt all soviet work to the demand of smashing the enemy encirclement .

The two last items were discussed under &quot; Others &quot; in the agenda .
All the subjects of discussion were proposals of voters at the election mass meeting , which were transmitted to the township soviet for discussion .
Inspection System
Of the two delegates1 congresses , one was to discuss problems and the other to inspect work .
Before each work inspection congress , the on @-@ duty delegates of the villages summoned the delegates under them to hold a meeting .
The on @-@ duty delegates then reported the results at the delegates &apos; congress .
Afterward , items which had not been carried out , or successfully carried out , were discussed in order to carry them out or correct them .
This method was started in Lang @-@ mu township .
Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township adopted it after being subdivided out of Lang @-@ mu township .
Subsequently , Yang @-@ ch &apos;en township also followed suit .
Recently , the district soviet called a district wide work inspection meeting and asked all the townships to adopt the method .
On @-@ duty Delegates
The numbers of delegates of the villages :
ChTang @-@ kang Village : Over 500 population ( at the time of land division ) 14 delegates .
T &apos;ang @-@ pei Village : Over 490 population14 delegates .
Hsin @-@ ch &apos;i Village : Over 300 population13 delegates .
Szu @-@ kang Village : Over 400 population14 delegates .
Work levels of the villages : First , Ch1ang @-@ kang ; second , T &apos;ang @-@ pei ; third , Hsin @-@ chTi ; fourth , Szu @-@ kang .
Each village had an &quot; on @-@ duty delegate &quot; by rotation among the delegates for 10 @-@ day periods .
It was started in September .
Before that , it was the &quot; chairman delegate &quot; system , and one person was designated to serve as the chairman .
After 2 years , the chairman system was found defective .
As the responsibilities were given to one person , the others had no chance to practice , while rotation would remedy the defect .
But the on @-@ duty system ( actually 10 @-@ day duty ) also had its defects .
The weak delegates were unable to lead the village .
Standing Committee
Since the formation of the soviet , there was always a standing committee .
The standing committee included a chairman , vice chairman , secretary , Chinese Communist Party branch secretary and Young Communist League branch secretary , totalling five persons .
When necessary , the on @-@ duty delegates attended the meetings .
Delegates in Charge of Residents
Each delegate was in charge of over 20 to over 50 residents .
Delegate Li Ch &apos;iu @-@ ying of Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang village , for instance , was in charge of over 50 residents .
Each delegate had a residents &apos; handbook , divided into sections on adult male , adult female , male vanguard team ( could serve as full @-@ time laborers ) , female vanguard team ( could serve as part @-@ time laborers ) , male children &apos;and female children .
The male adults were further divided into those serving in the Red Guard ( could serve as full @-@ time laborers ) and those not serving in the Red Guard ( could serve as part @-@ time laborers ) .
The female adults were also divided into those serving in the Red Guard ( could serve as part @-@ time laborers ) and those not serving in the Red Guard ( could receive preferential treatment as families of the Red Army ) .
Changes of Delegates
Before the new administrative divisions were made , Lang @-@ mu township ( 7 villages , population 3,000 ) elected over 70 delegates and 11 substitute delegates in the November election last year , totalling over 80 , including 16 women and over 60 men .
By the time of reelection on 1 November this year , only 5 men delegates were left .
Most of them had joined the Red Army and a small number had been transferred in their work .
Some 29 of them left at one time in Red May .
Before leaving , every department delegate called a meeting of the masses under his charge to elect an &quot; acting delegate . &quot;
Political Manifestations of the Delegates
Excellent60 percent .
Medium35 percent .
Inferior5 percent ( 4 persons ) .
The four inferior ones included two men and two women .
Very stupid and not positive , they attended only 4 of the 10 meetings and would not listen or express themselves at the meetings .
Their attitude toward the masses was &quot; crude . &quot; The masses did not like them and elected others to replace them in July .
The 16 Women Delegates
Excellent8 of them .
They looked for work to do and performed well .
Medium6 of them .
They did not look for work to do , but only did what was assigned to them .
They did not do the work well , and required help .
Inferior2 of them .
They did not do what was assigned to them .
The delegates * congress of ChTang @-@ kang township has many excellent creations , such as the standing committee , on @-@ duty delegates , delegates in charge of residents , and inspection system , which all deserve emulation by other areas .
The standing committee , however , should be renamed the presidium ( 7 members for the large townships ; 5 for the small townships ) .
The on @-@ duty delegate should be changed to the &quot; chairman delegate , &quot; selecting the best delegate to serve a 1- or 2 @-@ month term .
It is too frequent to change every 10 days .
The problems discussed at the meetings were very practical , but the five empty items on the daily agenda should be abolished .
Why not post the list of concrete issues to be discussed ?
The inspection system of Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township is very good .
It is a means for the full performance of work and speed in performance .
The inferior delegates should have been replaced much sooner .
Replacing them by reelection 8 months later was too long .
Electing a replacement immediately upon the departure of a delegate was correct , but the replacement should not be called an &quot; acting delegate . &quot;
95III .
This Election
The Election Committee
Nine members : Chinese Communist Party branch secretary , Chinese Communist Women &apos;s manager , farm laborers &apos; branch chief , handicraft branch chief , poor peasants &apos; league chairman and a member , production brigade leader , and two township delegates .
The branch secretary served as the chairman .
It was organized in September .
The county soviet originally decided to hold the election at the end of September , but the date was changed twice , and was finally set at the beginning of November .
Election Propaganda
In the propaganda , it was explained that the classes had not been clearly distinguished in the past , but now they were clearly distinguished .
Therefore , there must be an election .
It was also explained that , for the purpose of breaking the encirclement and for the purpose of inspecting the work and making it more advanced , there must be an election .
Voter Registration
All four villages made up record books for the delegates to register the residents under their charge .
The books were then submitted to the election committee which compiled the lists and posted them .
Those with voting rights were on the first list , those under age 16 who had no voting rights on the second list .
And landlords and rich peasants who were also without voting rights on the third list .
The first and second lists were red in color and the third one white .
The three lists were posted at the gates of the four villages and the township soviet .
The voters1 books were actually completed in September but , as the family members of workers were not classified as .
workers in the books , the error was rectified last month , and the lists re @-@ published .
Some people among the masses were not clear about the distinction of criteria btween electing &quot; worker &quot; and &quot; peasant &quot; delegates .
Less than 10 percent of the people in the hsiang correctly understood the issue of &quot; worker leadership . &quot;
Election Unit
Each of the four villages was an election unit , and there was also a worker unit .
Work Report
Voters &apos; meetings were held on 2 different days ( 19 and 20 October ) , 2 villages on the first day and 2 on the second .
The chairman made reports in Chfang @-@ kang and T &apos;ang @-@ pei villages on 2 different days .
The vice chairman ( who was the branch secretary ) made reports in Hsin @-@ chfi and Szu @-@ kang villages also on 2 different days .
The reports included military mobilization , economic construction and other work , altogether three items .
After the report , the candidates &apos; list was voted on .
The masses attending the meeting were asked to criticize the work of the hsiang soviet , but no one did .
Candidates &apos; List
The party branch managers * committee held a meeting on 19 October .
All the villages were represented ( 11 persons attending ) .
According to the ratio of workers and peasants in the villages , a list of 55 persons was drafted , exactly the number of delegates to be elected .
It was then distributed to the party cells , labor unions and poor peasants &apos; leagues of the various villages for discussion , proposed by the party members of the cells who made work reports at the voters &apos; mass meetings , and passed , thus eliminating the procedure of preparing the list by the election committee .
The list was published by posting it at the gates of the four villages and the township soviet .
Election Mass Meeting Time : 4 November .
The workers &apos; meeting , which was held at the township soviet , had a 90 percent attendance , the remainder being absent due to illness .
The peasants &apos; meetings were held separately in the four villages , with a 93 percent attendance .
The meetings were started in the forenoon .
Upon entering the door , a voter would write the word &quot; present &quot; on his own name on the list .
( The list had 24 spaces , printed and distributed by the county soviet , and the names of Ik voters were written thereon ) .
One man was posted at the door as guard .
Some children loitered outside , and a few of them came in .
Knowing that they had no share in the election , no landlord or rich peasant showed up .
Procedure : Reports were made by the election committee member , the township soviet chairman and the district soviet attending comrade .
The voters were asked whether they had any opinion .
( None ) .
The names on the candidates &apos; list were introduced one by one and voted on .
( Wo vote in the negative ) .
The proposals were discussed .
( Someone proposed that all those in the township age 16 to 45 in good health should proceed to the front line .
It was passed by the majority .
In addition , the &quot; military affairs , &quot; &quot; economy &quot; and &quot; dikes and roads &quot; proposals discussed at the delegates1 meeting on 8 November were all proposed at the election mass meeting this time . )
The meeting opened at 1000 after all participants had arrived , and adjourned at 1600 .
( The spirit was very good . )
Delegate Components
Among the 55 delegates , 36 were most positive and 19 medium .
No inferior ones were discovered .
Among the delegates , 60 percent ( over 30 of them ) were old delegates who were reelected to their current positions , and 40 percent were newly elected .
Delegates1 Congress After the Election
The first delegates &apos; congress was held the next day after the election ( 5 November ) in the forenoon , and it elected a chairman , a vice chairman , a secretary , and the delegates to the district mass meeting ( 10 persons ) .
Three comrades from the district soviet attended the meeting .
The second congress was held the 4th day after the election ( 8 November ) to discuss the proposals of the election mass meeting ( see above ) .
The defects in the election in Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township this time were :
( 1 ) In the propaganda , it was not pointed out that the Soviet was the political power for the masses to manage their own life , and that it was the most important right of the masses .
( 2 ) The number of people on the candidates * list was exactly the same as the number of delegates to &quot; be elected when It should have been twice as many .
Therefore , the masses did not express any criticism of the candidates &apos; list .
The election committee did not produce any effect on the issue of formulating the candidates &apos; list .
There was only party activity .
( 3 ) The work report meeting did not do its best to urge the masses to criticize the work of the township soviet .
Aside from such defects , everything was successful .
Committees Under the Township Soviet
The following were the mass organizations , divided Into village and township levels .
The village committees had five members , and the township commissioner served as the chairman .
Most of the township committees had 5 members , because there were village committees , but at times there were 7 , 9 , or 11 members .
Committee to Expand the Red Army
A total of 7 members , including 3 delegates , to discuss &quot; expansion , &quot; &quot; preferential treatment , &quot; &quot; comforting &quot; and &quot; welcome . &quot; The comforting team ( 7 members , including a team leader and 4 delegates , 1 man and 3 women ; the remaining 3 consisted of 1 man and 2 women ) carried peanuts , beans , vegetables and straw sandals to the hospitals and county seat , and once to Huang @-@ p &apos;o Hsiao @-@ pu , to comfort the Red Army .
Land Committee
Seven members .
Several meetings were held during the land investigation movement in September * and the 36 tan of land uncovered in the previous month were disposed of .
No meeting has been held since .
It should be changed to the agricultural experimental farm managing committee .
A farm products exhibition hall should be established in the experimental farm .
Land Registration Committee
Five members , 1 in each village .
The chairman was regularly stationed there .
Organized in July , it was active for 2 months .
After the registration was completed , the meals for the chairman was discontinued .
Method : The committee members went to the villages and gathered the information from the delegates for registration .
When the delegates did not have the information , the committee members visited the households concerned .
The registration was not completed in August because they did not understand the contents of the forms .
It was completed after a 1 @-@ month extension .
Hills and Woods Committee
Five members .
Besides the chairman , there was one in each village , in charge of planting and protection .
Some trees were planted , but did not flourish because of inferior soil .
They should have been planted along rivers , roads , and houses .
If many trees on a private hill were to be chopped down , the owner must consult the committee member , but if only a few , he did not have to do so .
There was provision as to the size of the trees .
Construction Committee
Five members , in charge of directing the &quot; water conservation &quot; and &quot; bridge &quot; committees .
Water Conservation Committee
Five members .
Besides the chairman , there was one member in each village .
Bridge Committee
Five members , in charge of bridge and road repairs .
Should be called bridge and road committee .
State Owned Property Committee
Five members .
It was there , but what it did is unknown .
Granary Committee
It was in charge of the care of public bond grain and the grain of Red Army public fields .
The famine preparation granary was also under its care .
The grain from the 36 tan of confiscated land , totalling over 10 tan , was stored for famine preparation .
Confiscation Committee
Three members , in charge of fines and donations .
From September on , the landlords paid 9 yuan in fines and the rich peasants donated 225 yuan ( 11 households , donating from 10 to over 40 yuan each ) .
In the past , the farms , hills and woods , buildings , plow animals and farm tools of the rich peasants were all confiscated , and the rich peasants were only allocated some inferior land , but no hills .
Now , they had to lease plow animals and farm tools from others .
As for their cash on hand , they were either &quot; fined &quot; in the past or at present .
One could not call it donation .
Currently , their living condition is even worse than the farm laborers .
( It must be pointed out that Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township &apos;s policy on the rich peasants is erroneous . )
Land Investigation Committee Nine members .
No longer in existence .
Education Committee Nine members .
Public Health Committee
Five members .
Organized in April .
Air and Poison Defense Committee
Five members .
Organized in October ; 4 or 5 meetings were held .
Preparation Committee
Organized for the purpose of the commemoration meeting .
The &quot; village &quot; committees of Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township ( the villages have many of the committees ) have expanded the contact of the Soviet with the masses .
It is an excellent creation when Soviet work has developed to a high degree .
As the villages have 5 @-@ member committees , many of the township committees only need 5 members .
Moreover , as 4 of the 5 members of each of the township committees serve as the chaimen of the 4 village committees , a network is formed , and it is a great help to the work of the delegates &apos; congress .
However , the comrades of Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township regard the committees as mass organizations in the same category as the labor unions and poor peasants &apos; leagues .
They do not know that they are a part of the Soviet .
This is not proper .
The &quot; construction committee &quot; can be abolished .
In regard to the &quot; land committee , &quot; in areas such as Hsing @-@ kuo where the land struggle is intense , it should be changed to the agricultural experimental farm committee .
&quot; Grain , &quot; &quot; census , &quot; &quot; worker @-@ peasant procurators &quot; and &quot; Red alert &quot; committees should be added .
Provisions on these have been made in the &quot; local Soviet Organization Law &quot; promulgated by the Central Government .

Service Work ( 1 ) Transport
Men served as full @-@ time laborers ( those over 45 years of age and not organized into the Red Guard served part @-@ time ) .
Women served as part @-@ time laborers ( some of them were selected and assigned to areas such as inside the city , Kao @-@ shing @-@ yu and Ch &apos;a @-@ ling ) .
Women also were assigned to rescue and nursing work ( some of them were selected to organize rescue and nursing platoons ; in readiness ; no work ) and laundry detail ( more than 10 from each village who were not tied down by young children were selected and organized into laundry details ; went to the replacement division and instructors team in Shao @-@ chi @-@ wo several times and Ch &apos;a @-@ ling two or three times to do laundry ) .
&lt; 2 ) Night patrol
ChTang @-@ kang , T &apos;ang @-@ pei and Szu @-@ kang had a total of three patrol stations , one shift per night , 5 or 6 persons per shift .
The Red Guard and the Young Pioneers each sent several members to take turns performing the task , under the supervision of the squad leader or assistant leader .
One person stood guard and the rest slept .
The patrol would ask for the password ( answer : &quot; Ordinary citizen , &quot; followed with name , destination and purpose .
Actually , the people did not know the password ) and check the road slip ( someone from another township passing through ) .
No bad people have ever been caught .

The Tfang @-@ pei patrol station caught four or five deserters and delivered them to the district government .
&quot; Ordinary citizens &quot; arrested someone without a road slip ( when he took a small path in the hills ) , who came from another county , was very ferocious , suspected of being a spy and delivered to the county government .
( 4 ) Air defense
The air and poison defense committee of the township instructed the masses on air defense and asked them to give their attention to the following ;
They must not run around when the planes come .
They must dig air @-@ raid caves .
Several households could dig one together .
In process , but not yet completed .
In case of poison gas , they must cover their noses with a handkerchief .
Those returned from field maneuvers said that charcoal dust should be wrapped in a handkerchief to cover the nose .
Every village had a signal gun station , manned by two persons .
When one was away , the other reamined ready to fire the signal gun .
All young and adult laboring masses should be organized into the Red Guard or the Young Pioneers and given the proper military and political training , in order to defend the locality on the one hand and be ready to go to the front on the other .
It is an important task of the soviet in the domestic war .
Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township has been successful in this aspect .
The Living Condition of the Masses
Famine was encountered this year .
Some 80 percent of the masses actually had no grain before spring planting this year , and rice had to be procured from such distant areas as Tung @-@ ku , Sha @-@ ts &apos;un , Fu @-@ t &apos;ien , and Shui @-@ nan .
The 80 percent of the masses averaged exactly 1 month of grain shortage .
Each person needed 5 tan a year , or 4 tan a month .
Eighty percent of the 1,500 population of the township was 1,200 , and 1 month &apos;s grain for them amounted to 480 tan .
The amount was procured from distant areas , and no one went hungry .
Though spring cultivation this year was good , the fall harvest was inferior due to insects , only equivalent to that of last year .
Nevertheless , ( 1 ) the fall cultivation was good , and there was a 40 percent increase in both potatoes and beans over last year .
( 2 ) Vegetables , broadbeans , snow peas and rape were added in winter planting .
( 3 ) After fall harvest last year , the masses sold large volumes of grain to the merchants , at only 2,800 wen per tan , not quite 1 yuan .
While they needed the money , they could have sold less , but no attention was given to it .
This year a county @-@ wide meeting was held .
It was decided that grain would not be sold for less than 4 yuan , and the volumes would be smaller .
( 4 ) After fall harvest last year , much was wasted on feeding hogs and ducks and chicken , but this year , less would he used for this purpose .
( 5 ) Last year , for the public bonds of the first and second periods , 2 yuan of public bonds required 2.5 tan of grain .
This year , 10 yuan of public bonds would only require 2 tan of grain .
There would , therefore , be no famine in the coming spring .
Surplus in Oil .
The peanut harvest this year was better than last , and peanuts could be made into oil .
Every household had been allocated some wooded hills , and they also had some oil .
Oil was ample .
There was even a surplus .
Beans could be traded for oil , but the amount of edible salt had been greatly reduced .
The bean harvest this year was good ( watering was even ; last year , almost the entire crop was ruined by flood ) , and the price of beans was good ( last year it was 9 yuan per tan ; this year , it was 12 yuan ) .
Beans could be traded for 60 percent of the edible salt needed by the township .
The 40 percent remainder could be made up by trading the surplus oil ( 30 percent surplus in oil ) .
The average per capita need of salt was 4 / 10 ounce &#91; Chinese unit &#93; per day ( or 12 ounces a month ) .
It was reduced to half in July this year ~ 2 / 10 ounce ( or 6 ounces a month ) .
In November it was a little over 3 / 10 ounce ( or appoxi-
mately 10 ounces a month ) .
The masses used sour pickle juice and declared
that it was not much different from salt .
( This was the crime of the Kuomintang .
Only by breaking down the blockade would there be salt ) .
Meat eating poor peasants doubled and workers tripled .
About 85 percent of the households &quot; raised hogs , &quot; and 15 percent of them were unable to do so .
They sold an average of 20 yuan &apos;s worth of hogs a year and bought about 12 yuan &apos;s worth of pork per household , leaving a surplus of 8 yuan .
Before the uprising , they only bought an average of 10 yuan &apos;s worth of pork per household per year .
According to the classes , before the uprising , the middle peasants bought about 12 yuan &apos;s worth of pork , the poor peasants about 6 yuan &apos;s worth and the workers about 4 yuan &apos;s worth .
Now , almost all of them spent 12 yuan .
( Some among them did not spend so much . ) In the past , let alone market days , not much meat was eaten even for the New Year and festivals .
Now , in addition to the New Year and festivals , everyone would buy some meat on market days .
The chickens and ducks , which were mostly sold in the past , were now mostly consumed by the peasants themselves .
The living condition improved , and less firewood was sold .
There was no lack of firewood in the locality .
In the past , more firewood was carried to the city to be sold .
Now , the amount sold was 30 percent less , because many people did not need to sell it any more .
The amount of clothes doubled .
For all wearing apparel , the average need per year per capita was one new unlined suit .
The middle peasants remained the same as before , but the poor peasants and workers had a 100 percent improvement .
They now had the ability to spend twice as much on clothes than they did before .
The living condition of the farm laborers improved .
There were about 22 households of farm laborers in the township and 60 percent of them were better off than the poorest of the poor peasants , because they had been allocated things .
The township had only 2 landowner households , but many things were confiscated from the rich peasants ( 12 households ) and sent down from the cities .
The living condition of the remaining 40 percent of the farm laborers was the same as the poor peasants .
The middle peasants remained at the same position .
Generally speaking , the living condition of the middle peasants was about the same as in the past .
( The soviet must give attention to improving the living condition of the middle peasants . )
Rest and Labor of the Masses .
Each person averaged 5 full days of meetings ( totalling the many meetings ) a month , which served as rest periods for them .
As many people had left the area and the labor force in the township had reduced , the labor intensity of the masses was the same as before the uprising , but the significance of labor had changed .
The soviet is the organizer of the mass life .
Only when it devotes all its effort to solving the problems of the masses , improving their living condition and gaining their confidence before it can mobilize the broad masses to join the Red Army , help in the war and struggle for the smashing of the enemy encirclement .
We must know that the great achievement of Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township war mobilization was indivisible from its achievement in improving the life of the masses .
Balancing of the Labor Force and the Plow Animal Problem 1 .
Model Cultivation Teams
Each of the 4 villages had 1 team , totalling about 70 persons .
They were organized with Red Army family members who had labor force .
Led by a team leader , each team was divided into subunits .
The 20 or more members of the Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang village model cultivation team , for instance , was divided into 3 subunits of 3 to 7 members according to the proximity of their residences .
Each subunit was in charge of several to a dozen or more households nearby , giving constant attention to their proper handling of production .
The teams were organized last August at the time of rice harvesting , and their function was to balance the labor force .
Method : The labor mutual aid association helped the Red Army families to farm the land ( no charge for wages ) , while the model team helped the masses with their cultivation ( wages charged ) .
For instance , when a mutual aid association member had to help a Red Army family to cultivate while his own farm required cultivation , the model team would send someone to help cultivate his land for him , or to take his place to help the Red Army family instead , and he would pay wages to the model team member .
The labor force was thus balanced .
Therefore , the model team and the mutual aid association must keep in close contact .
Labor Mutual Aid Association
Each of the four villages had a labor mutual aid association .
Except the Red Army families , 80 percent of those possessing labor power joined .
The township had over 300 association members .
Among the population of the hsiang :
Persons performing full labor10 percent ( about 150 persons ) .
Persons performing half labor20 percent ( about 300 persons ) .
Persons performing half labor20 percent ( about 300 persons ) .
Persons performing incidental labor35 percent ( about 525 persons ) .
Persons performing no labor30 percent ( about 450 persons ) .
Most of the first two categories , totalling about 450 persons , joined the mutual aid association .
Of the 320 persons away from their homes in township ( 226 serving with the Red Army , and 94 performing work ) , except for 10 or more belonging to the half @-@ labor category , they all belonged to the &quot; full @-@ labor &quot; category .
Compared with the remaining 150 persons performing &quot; full @-@ labor &quot; in the township , the ratio was 68 percent to 32 percent .
Therefore , organized balancing of labor power became a central issue in production and the masses enthusiastically welcomed the labor mutual aid association .
The function of the mutual aid association was the preferential treatment of Red Army families , mutual aid among members and helping the &quot; orphaned and aged . &quot; All the goals were reached .
As a whole , the farms of Red Army families were successfully cultivated .
The method was as follows :
Preferential treatment of Red Army families : In regard to the Red Army families in the township during busy seasons , each household required an average of about 25 work units of help per month ; during ordinary times , an average of about 10 works units .
The masses rendered help according to their ability .
Those with more labor force rendered more help , those with less rendered less help and those without rendered no help .
Women with young children seldom rendered help .
Generally , during busy seasons , where all members in a household could perform labor , the household would contribute 13 or 14 work units .
Where it had only 1 / 2 labor force , it would contribute 1 or 2 units of light work .
In regard to those who rendered less help than they should , they must pay those who rendered more help .
During a busy season , for instance , when household A contributed only 5 work units a month to Red Army families when it should have been 7 units while household B contributed 9 work units when it should have been 7 , household A must pay household B the wages for the 2 units .
Mutual aid among members : The work units were mutually offset .
Those who did less work would pay wages to those who did more work according to the number of work units .
Helping the orphaned and aged : Only meals for the members rendering help were provided ; no charge of wages .
Over @-@ all production plans with the village as the unit were formulated and the manpower balanced .
Account was settled at the end of every month and the wages computed .
( More people took money in payment .
Less took articles .
Accounts were always cleared . )
Wages : Rice harvesting work this year was divided into three levels .
The highest was 800 wen ( such as threshing ) , next was 640 wen ( such as cutting rice stalks , and carrying the stalks ) , and the lowest was 320 wen ( such as taking the rice and bean dibbling ) .
The above was decided at the membership mass meeting in July ( attended by up to 100 members ) .
In regard to the rice harvesting wages last year , it was 800 wen at the beginning and rose to a maximum of 1,400 wen at the busiest time .
Wage reduction : Wage reduction was supported by the farm laborers union because , with the land allocation , they were short of manpower .
Those with more labor force did not object either , because they must contribute much work to Red Army families .
The mutual aid association had five committee members , including a chairman , an organizer and a propagandist .
It was under the guidance of the fall harvesting and fall cultivation committee of the township .
The great effect of the labor mutual aid association on agricultural production has been clearly demonstrated in Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township .
According to the desire of the masses , overall planning of production with the village as the unit can be introduced in all areas , especially in areas where there have been many Red Army recruits .
When necessary , township or even the district can be taken as the unit for overall planning .
It was what Tsfai @-@ ch &apos;i District , Shang @-@ hang , did .
The cultivation team may be merged with the labor mutual aid association , in order to unify the organization .
There is an important issue here : Mobilizing the women to join production .
The young people and adults between age 16 and 45 in ChTang @-@ kang township numbered 733 .
Of these , 320 left home.to join the Red Army or perform other work , leaving 413 in the township , consisting of 87 men and 326 women ( a ratio of 1 to 4 ) .
Therefore , Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township relied mostly on women for its production .
The township proposed the slogan that &quot; women must learn to plow , &quot; and entire groups of women had joined the production front .
It proved that organized balancing of manpower and activating women to join production are tasks which cannot be separated .
That Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township &apos;s production not only did not drop , but increased , was because they had successfully solved this problem .
Plot Animal Cooperative
Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township began to organize the plow animal cooperative in September , one in each village , but had not yet completed the task .
Not many people joined the cooperative .
There was a five @-@ man committee .
The average was 25 cows per 100 households .
The township had a total of 110 cows .
No household had two cows .
Among those owning cows , 50 percent of the households had one cow ( mostly calves , costing 10 and odd yuan per head ) .
15 percent of the households had one cow per two families .
30 percent of the households had one cow per three or four families .
5 percent of the households had one cow per five families ( at times per seven , familieslarge buffaloes ) .
25 percent of the households had no cow .
Among the 437 households in the township , 109 had no cow .
The plow animal cooperative had not yet discussed its solution .
No cow was permitted to be slaughtered .
When an animal should be slaughtered due to illness or age , the owner must notify in advance the hsiang soviet , which would inspect the animal before granting permission .
No one dared to kill a cow deliberately .
Under the current agricultural technical condition , the function of the plow animal is just below manpower .
According to information of Shih @-@ shui township Jui @-@ chin ( 30 percent of the households had no cow ) , Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township , Hsing @-@ kuo ( 25 percent ) and Ts &apos;ai @-@ ch &apos;i township , Shang @-@ hang ( 20 percent ) , we know that peasants without plow animals constitute about 25 percent of the peasant population .
This is a big problem .
For its solution , nothing can surpass leading the masses to organize plow animal cooperatives and buy animals by pooling their funds .
Under the voluntary principle ( with the approval of the cooperative membership mass meeting ) , every household will contribute 2 to 3 sheng of grain per tan of land according to the amount of land allocated to it .
In Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township , for instance , each person was allocated 6 tan 2 ton of land , and 109 households have no cow .
With an average of 4 persons per household , the total number of persons is 436 , and the total area of land allocated to them is 2,703 tan .
At 3 pints per tan , there will be 81 tan of grain .
At 5 yuan per tan , there will be 405 yuan .
At 20 yuan per animal , there will be 20 head .
With each animal plowing 80 tan of land , the 20 animals will plow 1,600 tan .
Thus , more than half of the 2,703 tan of land will be plowed by animals .
By contributing 2 sheng per tan next year , the entire problem will he solved .
On the other hand , when leasing an animal to plow , the animal rent is 5 sheng per year per tan of land .
The method was suggested by the masses of Shih @-@ shui township .
They have already put it to practice .
We hope that all areas will follow suit .
It will not only solve a big difficulty of the impoverished peasants , but produce an even greater significance in increasing agricultural production .
Sale of Public Bonds
The public bonds issuance committee consisted of five members .
Every village had a chairman .
The township chairman attended the county and district meetings and undertook to sell 5,000 yuan of bonds .
Subsequently , 456 yuan was added , total @-@ r ing 5,456 yuan .
Upon his return , the township chairman called a delegates &apos; meeting , and the various village delegates pledged the amount to be sold in their particular villages .
The on @-@ duty delegates of the villages called mass meetings in their own villages .
The delegates and propaganda teams propagandized to the masses beforehand , led the masses to the meetings and explained the significance of bonds .
At the meetings , the delegates and the responsible persons of the various organizations took the lead and made their pledges , and the masses followed .
All the pledges were recorded on site .
The bonds were not entirely sold .
In regard to those who did not buy bonds or bought too little , the delegates and the propaganda teams propagandized from household to household .
&quot; Such a large amount this year ! &quot; Some of the masses could not understand .
The delegates and the propaganda teams compared last year &apos;s grain price ( 2.5 tan of grain for 2 yuanTs worth of bonds ) with this year &apos;s bonds ( only 2 tan for 10 yuan &apos;s worth of bonds ) , explained the &quot; benefits of the cooperative ( 2 dividends would exceed the cost of the shares ; those having no shares would not receive dividends ) , and expounded the significance of enemy blockade and economic construction .
A village @-@ wide mass meeting was again held , and an additional amount of bonds was sold , but the bonds were still not completely sold .
Propaganda was made again .
A third village @-@ wide mass meeting was held , and an additional amount was sold .
The bonds were still not completely sold , but not much was left .
At the fourth village mass meeting , all the bonds were sold .
A total of 5,456 yuan of bonds was sold , averaging over 3.70 yuan per person for the 1,464 population of the hsiang .
One household bought 45 yuan of bonds , which was the largest sale ; 5 or 6 households bought 30 yuan of bonds ; many bought 20 yuan of bonds ; very few bought 1 or 2 yuan , only around 10 households ; and none bought 0.50 yuan .
Some 10 or more &quot; orphaned and aged &quot; households did not buy any .
&quot; The masses were completely satisfied . &quot; From beginning to end , it took 15 days to sell all the bonds .
The special feature of Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang Township in its work was to devote their entire effort to mobilizing the masses and persuading them with a great patience .
As a result , their tasks were completely fulfilled and at the greatest speed .
Selling public bonds was only one of the instances .
The sale of over 5,000 yuan of public bonds was entirely done at the meetings , not by visiting the households .
It depended entirely on propaganda and agitation , not on coercive allocation .
It required four propaganda campaigns and four village mass meetings .
Yet , it took only 15 days from beginning to end .
Other townships while the sale was only 1 / 5 or 1 / 6 that of Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township , resorted to coercive allocation , and could not even complete the job after 2 or 3 months .
Compared with Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township it was truly heaven and earth !
IX .
The Cooperative Movement
The cooperative began in Ku @-@ lin village , Lang @-@ mu township ( Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township being then a part thereof ) , in 1931 , upon the conclusion of the third war .
At 0.50 yuan per share , the masses of the village collected over 80 yuan , began to do business , and were successful .
In January 1933 , it was changed to the Lang @-@ mu township cooperative .
No additional shares were solicited , the merchandise was cheaper than the market , and it was popular with the masses .
By September , it had gross receipts of 300 yuan and showed a profit .
In September last year , the district cooperative was formed , 800 shares ( at 0.50 yuan per share ) were subscribed for and collected , and the Lang @-@ mu township operative was merged into the district .
Staff members : During the village cooperative period , cooperative chief ( Li K &apos;uei @-@ ying , who subsequently became the chief of the township district , and county cooperatives ) , purchasing ( Li , who subsequently became the purchasing officer of the township district and county cooperatives ) , and accounting and business ( Wang Jen @-@ sen , who subsequently became the accountant of the township and district cooperatives ) had their meals provided by the cooperative , but they received no wage .
After the cooperative was changed to a township cooperative , it was decided to pay them 3 yuan per month each , but they refused .
The merchandise was directly procured from country stores .
During the village and township cooperative period , the cooperative members and Red Army families were given a discount of 50 wen for every 1,000 wen of purchases , or 5 percent .
The non @-@ members did not enjoy the discount , but the prices were cheaper than the market .
They could save 20 wen for every string of coins spent on purchases , or 20 percent .
In November this year , the district cooperative changed the discount on salt and cloth to 20 wen per string of coins ( because salt and cloth were expensive and not profitable ) , while for other merchandise , the discount remained at 50 wen .
The non @-@ members were charged market price .
At this time , there was a profit of 2 yuan for every 100 yuan of gross receipt .
Ill
From September last year to March this year ( 6 months ) , the district operative made a profit of over 600 yuan on a capital of over 400 yuan .
It designated 50 percent as public reserve fund , 10 percent as bonus to the business personnel and the managing and inspection committees , 10 percent as culture @-@ education expenses ( stationary for the clubs , schools , and children of Red Army families ) , and 30 percent as dividends .
To increase the dividends and encourage the members , the education expenses were temporarily abolished ( should be resumed in the future ) , and the dividends increased to 40 percent , paying 1 string of coins to every shareholder .
At the time of dividend payment , the accounts were cleared and published by posting .
After dividend payment , there was a big increase in capital .
In July this year , there was a total of 2,000 shares for 1,000 yuan .
In November , at the second dividend payment , each share was entitled to 0.50 yuan , but actually only 0.30 yuan was paid , leaving the 0.20 yuan as additional share .
It was decided to change the share unit to 1 yuan , and no one was permitted to have more than 10 shares .
The managing committee had 11 members , and the inspection committee 7 .
It was decided that the townships should establish branch cooperatives .
The Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township branch cooperative collected over 260 shares ( at 1 yuan per share ) and started business .
The Ku @-@ lin village cooperative was the first of its kind in the entire county .
Its operation was successful and it was known as a model cooperative .
The grain cooperative of the township solicited over 220 shares ( at 1 yuan per share ) .
Most of the subscribers paid in grain ( at 5 yuan per tan ) , which was all stored in a granary in Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang village .
It had not started business .
A managing committee was organized .
Every township and every district must emulate the consumer cooperative of Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township and Shang @-@ she district .
Culture Movement 1 .
Elementary Schools
Four Lenin elementary schools one in each village , each with a principal and a teacher .
Students : 55 in Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang ; 53 in T &apos;ang @-@ pei ; 33 in Hsin @-@ ch &apos;i ; 46 in Szu @-@ kang ; total 186 , constituting 65 percent of all the school age children in the township .
As for the remaining 35 percent , it was not because their parents did not want them to go to school , but because they would rather : .
play than study .
The students went to &quot; catch &quot; them .
Their punishment was sweeping the floor or being shut up , or even going without meals for those &quot; big and savage . &quot; The students initiated struggles among themselves , with &quot; very good spirit . &quot; The mischievous children spent less time in school than out .
The parents would see them out of the door , and they would then &quot; sneak off into the hills to fight battles . &quot; ( Some of the punishments were not suitable . )
All schools were divided into classes A , B and C.
The age of the students was 7 to 13 .
There were also some who were 14 or 15 years old , but they only attended half day because of production .
Those living far away brought their lunch , and those nearby went home for lunch .
The students provided their own paper .
The teachers were volunteers .
They were considered in the same category as work personnel severed from production , and the labor mutual aid association helped farm their land .
The teachers themselves would not say so , but the delegates &apos; congress decided to give them preferential treatment .
( Those regularly stationed in the township soviet received preferential treatment , but the delegates and the responsible persons of mass organizations not severed from production received no preferential treatment ) .
In Ho @-@ fu and Hsiu @-@ shui townships , the students collected rice for the &quot; teacher , &quot; 2 ton a month .
Yang @-@ ch &apos;en township had another method .
Where there was an elementary school in a certain village , the township soviet permitted the masses to select two persons ( age 50 or more who could not perform full @-@ time labor ) to work as peddlers , do some small business , and provide the meals for the &quot; teacher . &quot; The amount was the same as the township soviet personnel ( 0.09 yuan a day ) .
Meanwhile , the township soviet would not assign the two peddlers any service detail , and the two peddlers must be willing to undertake the task .
Most of the teachers were &quot; not profound in learning . &quot; 2 .
Night Schools
9 in the township : 3 in Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang ; 2 in T &apos;ang @-@ pei , 1 in Hsin @-@ ch &apos;i ; 3 in Szu @-@ kang .
Each school had an average of 32 students , totalling about 300 for the 9 schools , 30 percent men and 70 percent women .
Most of the 412 young people and adults , age 16 to 45 , in the township enrolled in the night school .
Some few &quot; old comrades &quot; over 54 years old also came to the school .
The masses were very pleased .
They declared that &quot; the night school is excellent ! &quot;
All schools were divided into A , B and C classes .
A small number of students brought their own lamps and some 4 or 5 persons shared one lamp .
Mostly , they depended on the one wood @-@ oil lamp furnished by the school , shared by 10 to 20 persons .
Each person contributed 2 or 3 p &apos;ien a month .
The students provided their own paper , pens and ink .
Teaching material :
Class Anewspaper reading ; arithmetic .
Class BAdult reader .
Class CChildren &apos;s reader .
Each school had a principal and a teacher .
The principal did not have to be literate as long as he was enthusiastic .
When the students were absent , &quot; the principal &apos;s instruction is requested . &quot; The principal also attended the class .
Most of the principals were &quot; old comrades . &quot; Of the 9 night school principals , 5 were women .
There were no women teachers , of the 9 night school teachers , 7 were township soviet delegates , and all were volunteers .
Literacy Classes
Those tied down with children , those more advanced in age , and those with too few members in the family and too far away were organized into literacy classes .
Organization : According to the proximity of residences , as few as 3 and as many as 10 were organized into groups , and a group leader , who could read a few words , was elected .
Most of the group leaders were night school students .
Teaching method : Any time , any place , any number of persons , while resting or drinking tea , one , three , or five persons .
At the beginning , characters were traced on the ground .
Later on , each student would have a notebook to learn how to write , beginning with such characters as &quot; table , chair , bench , pig , cow , chicken and duck . &quot; Every 10 days , the group leader collected the notebooks from the students for correction by a &quot; night school teacher , &quot; and those who &quot; wrote more and well &quot; were praised verbally .
The group leader would ask the night school teacher when he did not know how to write certain characters , and the latter , when he did not know how to write them , would ask the day school teacher .
By this method , those who did not know how to read at all before could now read 40 or 50 words , and some few of them could read 70 or 80 .
This method was introduced in the summer this year , but the literacy class was started last year .
Literacy placard : One in each village , nailed on walls of houses alongside the road .
Pictures and words were made on it , replaced every 2 or 3 days .
Sometimes , it was replaced as often as once a day or as long as 4 or 5 days ; 2 or 3 words were given every time , accompanied with pictures .
The day school teacher was responsible for it .
It was very effective .
Clubs
The township had four clubs , one in each village .
Every club had many committees , such as &quot; physical education , &quot; &quot; wall bulletin , &quot; &quot; evening meeting , &quot; etc .
Every village ran a wall bulletin , located in the Lenin elementary school .
Of the 10 articles , 8 of them were written by the elementary students and two by the masses .
All the clubs presented modern plays .
Every township soviet must emulate the culture and education work of Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township .
XI .
Hygiene Movement
Method
The residents were organized into hygiene details , according to the proximity of their residences , consisting of 4 or 5 , 7 or 8 , 11 or 12 households per detail , mostly 7 or 89 with a leader .
Though a major sweeping every 5 days was called for , actually it was mostly once every 7 days , and at times even every 10 days .
Supervision was necessary .
&quot; Without supervision , it would not be remembered , and there is so much work to do . &quot;
Work
( 1 ) Sweeping : No ashes or manure was stored in hallways and bedrooms .
Stagnant mud was cleaned out from ditches in front and behind .
Open , level spaces were swept and cleaned .
The people took turns sweeping and cleaning public ditches and level spaces .
( 2 ) Food : They only went as far as forbidding the people to eat dead things .
( 3 ) Clothes were washed .
In regard to those who failed to perform the above items , the children &apos;s league was activated to ridicule them , especially thosewearing dirty clothes .
The modern plays also depicted the hygiene movement .
Achievements
Erom April on , the first time was &quot; fairly good , &quot; but it then petered out .
Nothing was done in May and June .
Upon discovery , the township soviet criticized the hygiene committee chairmen , held another meeting of the committees ( besides the township hygiene committee , every village had a committee , all consisting of five members ) , and called on the villages to compete against one another &quot; to see which ones are better . &quot; It was put into effect under supervision in July .
There were great achievements in the 4 months since .
It was twice as clean as before .
Public Opinion
&quot; The Red Army and the Communist Party think of everything ! &quot; &quot; The government work personnel are truly concerned about us ! &quot; But some few people also remarked : &quot; Opening the windows !
If we don &apos;t die of illness , we will die from the wind blowing on us ! &quot; More intensive propaganda was needed .
Illness is a big enemy in the soviet areas , because it weakens our revolutionary force .
Activating a broad mass hygiene movement and reducing , even eliminating , diseases similar to what Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township did constitute the responsibility of each and every township soviet .
XII .
Social Relief
The township committee of the mutual relief association had five members ( including chairman , propagandist , and organizer ) .
The village had no committee .
It had a chairman , and there were small groups under him .
The association had 611 members .
Only about 20 households , mostly &quot; orphaned and aged , &quot; in the hsiang did not join the association .
The monthly charge was 1 p &apos;ien , which everyone paid .
Work :
Comforting the Red Army .
Soliciting donations for refugee relief and anti @-@ imperialism .
This was done twice this year .
Once when over 70 refugees from Hsin @-@ feng came to Hsing @-@ kuo city ( in the Lang @-@ mu township period ) , over 20 strings of coins were collected .
Another time was in aid of the Northeast Volunteer Army , also during the Lang @-@ mu township period ( the population at that time was 2,900 , and the number of members about 800 ) , when over 40 strings of coins were collected .
Donations started at 5 p &apos;ien , up to 100 , 200 , or 1 string .
Most of them were 100 , about 60 percent of the members .
Only a few persons gave as little as 5 p &apos;ien or as much as 1 string .
Donations were solicited to relieve those whose houses had burned down and the unemployed workers who were sick and had no medicine .
One household had a fire last spring and one and one @-@ half rooms were burned down .
More than 6 strings of coins were collected and given to the owner .
Belief of the hungry .
In the summer this year , three or four persons in Lang @-@ mu township had nothing to eat ( were beggars in the past , still very poor now ) and asked the district mutual relief association for money and rice They were given 1 to 3 pints each and every time for 3 or 4 times during the
summer .
Relief of Red Army families .
To relieve those among the Red Army families who were sick or had difficulties ( no one hungry ) , more than 11 strings of coins were collected at one time in the summer .
In April , the cooperative loaned the money for capital and several volunteers among the
masses went to purchase rice , carried it to Ch &apos;iao @-@ t &apos;ou Chiang @-@ pei @-@ tung to sell , and made a profit of over 100 strings of coins for the relief of those who were sick or had difficulties among the Red Army families .
The volunteers did not take any money besides their meals .
The soviet of many areas gives no attention to relief work .
The mutual relief association in such areas only collects the monthly dues but does not perform any relief work .
The social relief work of the township soviet and mutual relief association of Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township is commendable .
Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township solved every difficult problem of the masses in the west concrete and practical manner .
XIII .
Women
The women worker and peasant delegates &apos; congress had a chairman in every village .
All the village chairmen and a women &apos;s director formed the presidium of the township women worker and peasant delegates &apos; congress .
The township had a total of 43 delegates , 12 from Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang , 11 from T &apos;ang @-@ pei , 9 from Hsin @-@ ch &apos;i and 11 from Szu @-@ kang .
It was organized in November last year .
There was a reelection in March this year .
The third election was held in September .
There was one meeting every 7 days in all the villages , all held according to schedule , with only a handful absent every time ( tied down by children ) .
The delegates had separate responsibilities , each in charge of 5 to 10 households , mos ly 6 or 7 .
The township soviet delegate was in charge of the first election upon the creation of the congress .
The village was the unit , and all the laboring women age 16 and above were asked to come to the meeting .
An average of 60 percent of them in all the villages attended the meetings .
According to the proximity of their residences , several households ( not the same numbers ) elected one delegate .
The delegates elected at that time were slightly fewer than now .
At that time , as the women still did not understand the function of the women delegates &apos; congress , they were not very enthusiastic .
After the delegates were elected , some few of them were not very positive .
The delegates &apos; congress had no presidium , only a chairman .
The villages did not even have a chairman .
There was a reelection in March this year .
The method was the same as before , but the women &apos;s chairmen were in charge .
The township soviet delegates of the villages also participated to render help .
The number of households to be under the charge of the women &apos;s delegates was determined , and the township was to organize a presidium , but there was no chairman in the villages .
For the third election in September , the method was changed .
No village @-@ wide women &apos;s mass meeting was called .
The women delegates called election meetings of the women in the households under their charge , and the township soviet delegates participated to render help .
During the first and second election meetings , only the delegates were elected , but no problem was discussed .
At the third election , such problems as &quot; expanding the Red Army , &quot; &quot; comforting the Red Array , &quot; &quot; preferential treatment of Red Army families , &quot; &quot; women learning to plow , &quot; and &quot; women buying public bonds with silverware &quot; were discussed .
The marriage issue was discussed among the problems brought up at the regular meeting every 7 days .
The women declared : &quot; We want the correct freedom , not vagabond freedom .
We must not ask for a divorce whenever there is an argument . &quot; During the election movement this year , the women &apos;s candidates &apos; list was discussed .
However , other intimate problems concerning women , such as &quot; women &apos;s diseases , &quot; &quot; children &quot; and &quot; women &apos;s education , &quot; were not discussed .
There was complete freedom of divorce in the township .
The husbands seldom scolded their wives , but there were more wives who scolded their husbands .
( Neither should scold the other . ) Spanking of children had not been completely stopped , but it was reduced .
( There should be no spanking at all . ) The children had become more intelligent .
In the past , when spanked or scolded by their parents , they seldom retorted , but now more of them retorted .
( If the parents did not spank or scold them , the children would not be retorting . )
About 1 percent of the women married 3 times in the 4 @-@ 1 / 2 years after the uprising .
Clandestine love affairs constituted about 50 percent before the uprising , but they were reduced to 10 percent after the uprising .
They were further reduced this year because of land allocation , freedom to divorce or marry , and busy revolutionary work .
Their clothes were shortened and &quot; fancy borders &quot; eliminated .
Except &quot; old ladies , &quot; the women cut their hair .
Some &quot; old ladies &quot; also had their hair cut .
Older women with long hair constituted about 20 percent of the women .
Among the masses , in the past ( before the uprising ) , there were frequent quarrels and fistfights , and even more arguments .
Now , there are no more fistfights , and even arguments decreased .
When there was an argument in the past , no one would explain matters to the parties , and even when someone tried to pacify them , they were &quot; not convinced in their mind . &quot; Now , the moment an argument occurs , a delegate comes out to explain matters to them , and they immediately &quot; became convinced . &quot; Arguments mostly occurred among the older comrades .
They attended less meetings and did not understand revolutonary work clearly .
When asked to render preferential treatment to Red Army families , they would sometimes argue .
However , the majority who did not understand , they were mostly &quot; old ladies &quot; who &quot; always refused to go to the meetings . &quot;
Since last year , no old lady has worshipped the gods ( burning incense and offering rice ; begging the gods and bowing to the Buddha ) , but every village still has one or two persons who try to &quot; summon the spirit of the dead . &quot; The reasons for such prompt elimination of superstition were ( 1 ) knocking down of local tyrants and land division , ( 2 ) the anti @-@ superstition propaganda of the children &apos;s league and Young Pioneers and the soviet movement
to save the money on incense and candles , and ( 3 ) direct interference by the Young Pioneers ( taking away the incense and candles ) .
( Should be persuasion rather than interference ) .
However , although they did not dare to worship the gods openly , some old ladies still Relieved in the gods .
Most of those had no son .
The great strength of women in the revolutionary war has been clearly demonstrated in the soviet areas .
In the land investigation movement and all types of mass struggles , on the economic front ( Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township relies mainly on them ) , on the cultural front ( many women are in charge of rural education ) , in military mobilization ( their movement to expand the .Red Army and comfort the Red Army ; their service as part @-@ time laborers ) , and in the soviet organization ( the effect of the women delegates in the township soviet ) , their heroic bearing and great achievements have been manifested .
Here , the leadership and motivation of the women &apos;s worker and peasant delegates1 congress are the crucialJlink .
It must first closely tackle the problems connected with the intimate interest of the women masses and coordinate all political mobilizations with the mobilization on such problems .
On this point , the attention of many areas is extremely inadequate , and even Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township has not rendered it full attention .
The soviet of each and every township must place the work of guiding the women &apos;s worker and peasant delegates &apos; congress on its daily agenda .
XIV .
Children
The children &apos;s league committee in the township had 5 members , with a secretary .
In the villages , there was a chairman .
Of the children age 7 to 15 80 percent joined the children &apos;s league .
Those who had not joined were mostly 7 @-@ year @-@ olds ( too small ) and 15 @-@ year @-@ olds ( because they had joined the Young Pioneers .
Ordinarily the minimum age for the Young Pioneers was 16 , but some joined earlier because of their size ) .
More boys than girls joined .
Work : ( 1 ) They propagandized on expanding the Red Army and the return @-@ to @-@ the ranks movement .
( Only when a person refused after three or four propaganda efforts would he be ridiculed .
The township had never had a ridicule team . ) ( 2 ) They held competitions to collect dog excrement for the &quot; fertilizer station &quot; and shovel up grass roots for the &quot; fertilizer room . &quot; . ( 3 ) The members paid 1 p &apos;ien of monthly due to comfort the Red Army .
( 4 ) They promoted the thrift movementeating less fruits and buying more public bonds , 0.50 , 1 , 2 or 3 yuan .
Most of them bought 0.50 yuan .
Sixty percent of the children bought public bonds .
( 5 ) They played games , drilled and practiced fighting battles in the drill field on Sundays .
A program was formulated .
( 6 ) The majority of them were enrolled in the Lenin school .
The discipline of the children &apos;s league was very strict .
Some mischievous children who defied their parents and teachers obeyed the discipline of the children &apos;s league .
Punishments consisted of sweeping the floor or being shut up .
They always &quot; listen to reason and admit their errors . &quot; ( Should be more persuasion and less punishment . )
In the past , 9- and 10 @-@ year @-@ olds took care of cows for the landlords and rich peasants , but this was no longer true .
In the past , whether at home or working outside , the labor time of children was always 10 hours or more , the same as for adults .
They had no time to rest or study .
Now , they spend the greater portion of their time studying and playing games , and only about 1 @-@ 1 / 2 hours in the morning taking care of cows or doing other jobs .
In busy farming seasons , they worked longer periods .
They would ask the teachers for leave to help their parents .
In the past , they were spanked and scolded by their parents .
Now , they were seldom spanked or scolded .
XV .
Workers
Carpenters : 30 percent unemployed ; only 7 work units available for each 10 work units ; daily wage 550 .
Tailors : Most of them unemployed ; daily wage 400 .
Masons : 30 percent unemployed ; daily wage 550 .
Bamboo workers : 10 percent unemployed ; daily wage 400 .
Barbers : 10 percent increase .
Each customer paid the barber 8 sheng of grain a year .
Part @-@ time laborers : Daily wage at ordinary times 400 ( 2 mao ) ; during busy time 800 ( 4 mao ) .
XVI .
Poor Peasants &apos; League
The township committee had three members ( chairman , propagandist organizer ) and the village committee 5 members .
There were 271 members in July this year , which was increased to 386 in November .
In the past , &quot; the poor peasants &apos; league is called on for everything , &quot; but attention was not given to making sound its organization .
In the land investigation movement this year ( July ) , the organization was readjusted , the village committee abolished , and the membership developed .
Before July , sometimes no meeting was held for 2 months .
After July , the village poor peasants &apos; league held a meeting every 5 , 10 or 15 days , depending on the need of the work .
The township league held one meeting a month .
The problem discussed included &quot; class investigation , &quot; &quot; each member saving 0.12 yuan , &quot; &quot; developing the membership , &quot; &quot; making sound the organization , &quot; &quot; developing production &quot; and &quot; fines and donations . &quot; In regard to expanding the Red Army , preferential treatment of Red Army families , economic construction and culture and education , only reports were made to the members .
When the township congress made decisions on such matters , they were &quot; announced &quot; at the poor peasants &apos; league meeting and there was no special discussion .
( There should be discussion ) .
No monthly dues were charged .
There were small groups under the village .
In all areas where the land investigation movement has not become intensive , the poor peasants1 league is specially important .
The township soviet must be responsible for its leadership .
There should be a poor peasants &apos; league committee in the village .
The village should serve as the unit for meetings , and meetings with the township as the unit may be decreased .
Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township &apos;s practice is correct .
XVIII .
Propaganda Teams
The township had a propaganda middle team , 7 members , 1 leader .
Every village had a propaganda small team , 5 members in the large villages ( Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang and T &apos;ang @-@ pei ) and 3 in the small villages ( Hsin @-@ ch &apos;i and Szu @-@ kang ) , with a leader .
They made propaganda for &quot; expanding the Red Army , &quot; &quot; economic construction , &quot; and the &quot; commemoration festival . &quot;
Patterns of propaganda : ( 1 ) Individual propaganda , most numerous .
( 2 ) Making propaganda when the on @-@ duty delegate gathered the masses of the village to discuss work .
( 3 ) Propagandizing to the masses when the district county held commemoration festival mass meetings ; also propagandizing to the &quot; ranks &quot; of other township and ch &apos;us .
Every 7 days , the township soviet called together the middle and small team leaders , altogether five persons , for a &quot; propaganda meeting . &quot; The district soviet held meetings of all the propaganda team leaders in the district , at least twice a month , sometimes three times .
Every meeting lasted at least 4 hours .
.
The participants went home to eat after the meeting .
The township had a total of 23 team leaders and members , about 60 percent of them women .
They were all &quot; relatively articulate , &quot; but not necessarily literate .
They were not replaced .
Only in case of transfers would there be replacements .
They concentrated on studying propaganda material and methods and &quot; how to make the masses understand even better . &quot; Organizing was started in last February .
XVIII .
Surprise Attack Teams
Five persons under the township soviet , one team leader .
In regard to the villages , Chrang @-@ kang , TTang @-@ pei and Hsin @-@ ch &apos;i had surprise attack teams and Szu @-@ kang had none .
They were organized by Red Army wives .
In any village where the work had become stagnated , the surprise attack team of another would go there to inspect and render help , explaining to the villagers the methods followed by other villages to perform the work .
The township surprise attack team had the same function , inspecting and helping any village where the work had come to a standstill .
The surprise attack team performed less work than the propaganda team ; it did not demonstrate a great effect .
The township soviet called them together for meetings three or four times .
Organizing began in Augus .
Propaganda and surprise attack teams are excellent .
All the townships should organize them .
XIX .
Revolutionary Competition
The measure of holding competitions was started during the spring cultivation movement this year and the items of competition included &quot; comparatively early , &quot; &quot; comparatively good , &quot; and &quot; no uncultivated land . &quot; All the township chairmen , holding a meeting at the district soviet , signed a competition agreement among the townships .
The district called a meeting of the village on @-@ duty delegates to sign competition agreements among the villages .
The on @-@ duty delegates of the villages each called a meeting of the village delegates to sign the competition agreement in the village .
There was no competition among the households .
( Could also be signed , ) The following items were included in the agreement : The maximum standards for the items of competition ; the competing villages ; the kinds and numbers of prizes ( first class , red flag ; second class , 100 sheets of writing paper ; third class , 50 sheets of writing paper ) ; the period of competition ; the responsible person and the referee .
During the period of competition , the township congress held an inspection meeting , and the on @-@ duty delegates made reports covering the progress of the various villages .
After the meeting , the chairmen ( referees ) made an inspection tour of the villages to verify the reports of the on @-@ duty delegates .
In April , there was another competition .
The goal was &quot; military mobilization , &quot; divided into &quot; e ; xpanding the Red Army , &quot; &quot; comforting work &quot; and &quot; preferential treatment of Red Army families . &quot; ( There was no return @-@ to @-@ the @-@ ranks movement , because there was no deserter at that time .
This item was added in May . )
On 20 May , the hsiang congress held a summation meeting on the competition in &quot; spring plowing &quot; and &quot; military affairs . &quot; Hsin @-@ ch * i won the red flag , Ch / ang @-@ kang 100 sheets of writing paper , T &apos;ang @-@ pei 50 sheets and Szu @-@ kang nothing .
In July , competition agreements on &quot; military affairs &quot; and &quot; economy &quot; were signed .
There has been no summation yet , but Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang is known to be the best .
To strive for speed in work , the method of revolutionary competition should be introduced in every township .
The township soviet is the leader of the competition , but only the &quot; leader , &quot; because it is mainly a competition among the masses , not the village delegates ..
Therefore , for the signing of every competition agreement , it must be reported to the masses at the mass meeting ,
with the village as the unit , for their approval , and the agreement posted .
For competition on production items , a meeting of the several dozen residents under the leadership of every delegate must be held , and the competition reported to them for their approval .
The results of achievement inspections for any one period must also he reported at such meetings , , in order to promote the progress of the work .
Whenever a competition produces no achievement , it is always because the competition agreement is put in the pockets of a few persons , and the broad masses are not motivated .
A summation must be made for each competition , and the prizes awarded .
As a whole , Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township accomplished all these in its two competitions .
That was why they made practical successes .

INVESTIGATION IN TS &apos;AI @-@ HSI TOWNSHIP
&#91; Text &#93; I Administrative Divisions
The well @-@ known Upper and Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi of the Central Soviet Area belong to Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi District of Shang @-@ hang County , Fukien .
After recent division of administrative areas , Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi District is divided into the following 8 townships : Upper Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi , Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi , Ling @-@ pao9 T &apos;ung @-@ k &apos;ang , Tseng @-@ Is , &apos; ang , Wen @-@ ts &apos;ai , T &apos;ai @-@ ti and Hsia @-@ sheng .
Upper Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi : 523 families , 2,318 persons .
Divided into 4 villages : Li @-@ wu ( population about 600 ) , Yang @-@ hsia ( 500 ) , Chung @-@ hsing ( .500 ) and Shang @-@ wu ( 600 ) .
Regularly stationed in township soviet : chairman , secretary .
Because this is a big ship the secretary regularly posted here to help with the work of the township soviet .
Lower TsTai @-@ hsi : 503 families , 2,610 persons .
Divided into 4 villages : Chang @-@ k &apos;eng ( population about 600 ) , Hsia @-@ k &apos;eng ( 500 ) , Fa @-@ k &apos;eng ( 800 ) , Sun @-@ wu ( 700 ) .
II Representative Conference 1 .
Number of Representatives
Upper TsTai @-@ hsi : Formerly 53 representatives .
In the recent election workers &apos; dependents were counted as workers , increasing the number of representatives to 75 ( 22 are newly added , mostly bricklayers of the township ) .
Of the original 53 representatives , 13 are workers .
With another 22 added , there are now 35 worker representatives .
The remaining 40 are peasant representatives .
There are 183 workers in the township belonging to 163
families averaging 3 persons each , bringing the total worker population to 489 .
Because there is one representative for every 13 persons , the above @-@ mentioned number has been elected .
Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi : Formerly 73 representatives .
Now there are 91 , with 28 &#91; sic &#93; newly added , also because of an increased election ratio of workers &apos; dependents .
Delegation of Representatives
There are 10 to over 20 representatives in each village .
The representatives of each of the 4 villages hold separate meetings to elect one of their number to form a &quot; delegation11 to the township soviet , so that there are 4 members in the delegation .
Minor work is settled at conferences of the delegation called by the chairman .
Every time the representatives hold a conference , the delegation meets beforehand ( either in the morning or the day before ) to make preparations .
The representatives meet once about every 5 days .
This procedure began in 1931 .
( Delegation should be called chief representatives instead ) .
Relationship Between Representatives and Residents
Each representative is in charge of 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , or , at roost , 50 @-@ odd residents .
Worker representatives have fewer residents in their charge , while peasant representatives have more .
This arrangement began in 1932 .
Political Showing of Representatives
Of the 53 representatives of Upper Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi :
The most active : more than 20 ;
Medium active : more than 20 ;
The worst : One .
This worst representative attends only 3 meetings out of every 10 .
He busies himself with making his own living , but works reluctantly at jobs assigned to him .
After repeated criticism , he has been removed from his office by the conference of representatives .
There is no worse representative among the 73 representatives of Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi .
Transfers of Representatives , Election To Fill Their Vacancies
The 53 representatives of Upper Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi were elected in November last year , By the time a new election was held on 14 November this year , 27 had joined the Red Army ( they all went at the same time in November last year ) and 11
were transferred to other posts .
Altogether 38 left , leaving 15 .
Meetings of electors were held at each of the villages to elect new representatives to replace the old ones .
Worker representatives were elected to fill vacancies left by workers , and peasant representatives were elected to fill those left by peasants .
Where there were alternate representatives , the vacancies were filled by them .
This additional election meeting was held in November last year .
After that , no election meeting was held until October this year , when there were only 42 representatives left because 11 of them were again transferred one after another in the interval .
There were 73 representatives in Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi .
In Red May this year , 11 of them joined the Red Army .
Additional election meetings were held at the village level to fill their vacancies .
In July another 15 joined the Red Army , and another additional conference was held to fill the vacancies .
The vacancies left by 18 others who were transferred to other posts were filled by alternate representatives .
Women Representatives
Of the 53 representatives of Upper Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi at the time of the October election last year , 16 were women , or 30 percent of the total .
Of the 73 representatives of Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi . , 21 , or also 30 percent , were women .
After the additional elections and up to the October election this year , of the 53 representatives of Upper Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi , 33 , or almost 60 percent , were women .
Of the 73 representatives of Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi , 43 , or also 60 percent , were women .
After.the recent election , of the 75 representatives of Upper Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi , 43 , or still 60 percent , are women .
Of the 91 representatives of Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi , 59 , or 66 percent , are women .
The system of having a chief of village representatives and fixed relations between representatives and residents is a great advance in soviet organization and leadership .
Like the townships of Ch &apos;ang @-@ wang and Shih @-@ shui , Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi township has gained results in this regard .
The heart of the township is in the village .
Therefore , village organization and leadership is a problem that deserves the utmost attention .
The whole area of the township is divided into so many villages .
By relying on the strong leadership of the township soviet representatives of the people themselves , the village committee and mass organizations of the village , the masses of the whole village are organized like a network under the soviet to carry out all work of the soviet .
This is the most obvious superiority of the soviet system over all other political systems in history .
The system adopted in Ch &apos;ang @-@ wang , Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi , Shih @-@ shui and other townships should be extended to the whole soviet area .
This Election
( 1 ) The election was led by the election committee .
( 2 ) Residents and electors were registered .
Three rolls of names were made public .
( 3 ) The namelist of candidates contained more than 160 in Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi ( 91 of them were elected ) .
The namelist was posted in each village , and each list contained more than 160 names .
Many of the people wrote comments of 2 , 5 or 6 , or more than 10 characters under the names of candidates .
Even children jotted down theirs .
Most of them wrote &quot; good &quot; or &quot; not good . &quot; Some of them wrote &quot; agree &quot; or &quot; negative . &quot; One of the candidates had the word &quot; bureaucratic &quot; written under his name .
Over 20 were criticized in wall posters .
The criticized candidates were those who were concerned only with making their own living , neglected the interests of the masses , and worked passively for the public .
There were some poems and songs , three of which criticized the township soviet for handling the problem of paper @-@ making badly .
( 4 ) Congress of electors was held with townships as the unit .
The township soviet reported on its work .
( 5 ) Workers of the whole township formed a unit .
Peasants of each village formed a unit ( 4 of them ) .
( 6 ) The election rally was attended by 80 percent of the electors .
The sick , those on sentry duty , those who worked for the cooperative and were out on buying missions , and women in their final month of pregnancy , totaling 20 percent in all , did not attend .
Old people came , leaning on staffs .
( 7 ) Many meetings were held for the election .
The labor union , poor peasants leagues , women &apos;s association , mutual @-@ aid association and antiimperialist alliance held a rally of members together .
The children &apos;s league and Young Pioneers also held meetings .
The Party and the League were the first to hold meetings .
There were slogans and pamphlets .
So this year &apos;s election propaganda was far more extensive than last year &apos;s and most people realized the meaning of election .
Last year youngsters under 16 clamored for the right to vote .
They asked , because many of them had already joined the Red Army and their work was far better than that of others , why were they not given the right to vote ?
This year they understood why their age was a barrier , and they clamored no more .
Propaganda teams went to all villages to make propaganda .
During the day they made speeches .
At night they gave shows .
( 8 ) At the rally of electors there was agitation to buy bonds .
More than 1500 yuan &apos;s worth of bonds was bought by those at the rally in Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi .
Another 630 yuan &apos;s worth was bought in Upper Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi .
At the rally of electors in T &apos;ai @-@ ti township , 13 persons were persuaded to join the Red Army .
One of the 2 squads of the Model Battalion of the Red Guard Army of the whole township joined the Red Array .
( 9 ) Election of new cadres :
Of the 75 representatives of Upper Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi , 21 are re @-@ elected from the former 53 representatives and 54 are newly elected .
Thirty @-@ two former representatives are not re @-@ elected .
Of the 91 representatives of Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi , 50 are re @-@ elected from the former 73 representatives and 41 are newly elected .
Twenty @-@ three of the former representatives are not re @-@ elected ,
In general , the elections in Upper and Lower.Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi were successful .
In their election propaganda , organization of lists of candidates and urging of the masses to criticize the candidates , correlation of the election to other work and organization of workers and women so they might be elected , they have fully implemented the Central Government &apos;s instructions regarding the elections , so that they become models of the election campaign in the soviet area .
On the other hand , in urging electors at the election rallies to make proposals for discussion by the new representatives , they have not made a good showing .
The model in this respect should be Ch &apos;ang @-@ wang township of Hsing @-@ kuo .
Committees Under the Township Soviet
There are many committees under the township soviet .
The following are several examples :
&quot; Support the Red Army &quot; : Upper and Lower TsTai @-@ hsi each has 5 committee members .
Each of the 4 villages has a committee , also of 5 members each .
&quot; Preferential Treatment for Red Army Dependents &quot; : Upper and Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi each has 5 members .
Each village also has 5 members .
&quot; Land Investigation &quot; : The two townships each has 11 members .
The villages have none .
&quot; Election &quot; : The two townships each has 7 members .
None for the villages ,
&quot; Land &quot; : Upper Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi has 11 members and Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi 7 .
None for the villages .
&quot; Labor &quot; : The two townships have 7 members each .
There is no such committee at the village level , but only groups , which are committees of the labor cooperative .
&quot; Forestry &quot; : Upper Ts ? ai @-@ hsi has 7 members , Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi has 11 .
&quot; Return of Deserters &quot; : Each of the two townships has 12 members .
There are no &quot; spring plowing , &quot; &quot; summer plowing &quot; ... committees .
Only &quot; land tilling teams &quot; are organized .
Five persons form a group , 10 a squad , 30 a medium team and 100 a large team .
Upper and Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi each has a large team .
Land tilling teams are organized principally for the sake of giving preferential treatment to dependents of the Red Army .
The organizing and leading of the many committees under the township soviet becomes an important part of its work .
This is again demonstrated in Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi township .
The Central Government has adopted the experience of various localities and incorporated it in the &quot; Organic Law of Local Soviets . &quot; This provides that a township may organize more than 20 regular and ad hoc committees .
The number may be appropriately increased or decreased in accordance with the requirements of the work of the localities .
An &quot; urban &quot; soviet , on the other hand , will have to organise a number of committees different in character to the rural ones , in accordance with the special character of urban centers .
The clearly defined and unified establishment of this system will draw still closer the relationship between the Soviets and the masses , and will lend enormous strength to the execution of all work of the soviet .
One problem is that the village should also set up certain important work committees ( people &apos;s organizations with large memberships should likewise set up their village @-@ level leadership organs ) .
This is because if there are only township @-@ level committees , it will be impossible to carry out thorough , careful work in townships with a large population of about 1,000 .
This will be assured if many villagelevel committees are set up .
Expansion of the Red Army
In the 3 months of August , September and October :
Upper TsTai @-@ hsi : 60 persons .
Two platoons of a model battalion mobilized .
In addition , 11 persons have rejoined .
There are still 2 or 3 who have not rejoined owing to illness .
Lower TsTai @-@ hsi : 65 persons .
The model battalion mobilized 52 persons all at once .
On another occasion , when men were individually mobilized , 13 persons joined up .
In addition , 11 persons have rejoined .
There are still 14 others who have not yet rejoined .
There were 12 townships in the district ( before division ) .
On 15 August 273 persons were mobilized to join the model battalion .
The redivided district comprises 8 townships .
In all , more than 50 persons have not yet rejoined .
Of the whole district , the two townships of Upper and Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi have produced the best results in expansion of the Red Army .
The principal reason is that they have always done well in giving preferential treatment to Red Army dependents and comforting the Red Army .
Previous to Red May , an average of 500 pairs of cloth and straw sandals a month could be collected from each of the 8 townships .
The quantity was recently slightly reduced owing to the blockade and scarcity of cloth .
Nevertheless , Upper and Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi have been able to produce the following results : Upper Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi , over 500 pairs in August , over 100 pairs in September , and over 90 pairs in October .
Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi , over 300 pairs in August , 280 pairs in September , 300 pairs in October and 630 pairs in November .
These results have been obtained mainly owing to mobilisation by the Party and League branches of Party and League members to provide leadership to conferences of women worker and women peasant representatives : ( 1 ) Party and League members first held meetings ; ( 2 ) women representatives held meeting ; ( 3 ) women held mass meeting .
The women representatives meet once every 10 days .
There is a presidium of 5 at the township level .
One of these is elected director .
The remaining 4 are assigned to the 4 villages , one for each village , serving as chief of the village .
The women representatives discuss all problems which are also discussed by the township soviet .
They make particular exertions in matters of comforting the Red Army , selling bonds and expanding production .
In addition , they also frequently discuss matters of interest to themselves , such as the marriage problem .
They explain marriage regulations to the womenfolk .
Mobilization of large numbers of the masses to join the Red Army depends on : ( 1 ) Politically , full propaganda and encouragement , abolition of all methods of coercion ; ( 2 ) full preferential treatment for dependents of Red Army men ; and ( 3 ) healthy and sound organization and training of local armed forces .
Preferential treatment for dependents of Red Army men is a fundamental work that would make the masses gladly join the Red Army and contentedly stay with the Red Army .
This is fully borne out by the experience of the townships of Ch &apos;ang @-@ wang and Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi .
There are 407 young and adult males ( 16 to 45 years of age ) in Ch &apos;ang @-@ wang township .
Of this number , 320 , or 80 percent , have left to join the Red Army and work .
There are 554 young and adult ( 16 @-@ 55 years of age ) males in Upper Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi , 485 , or 88 percent , o them have left to join the lied Army and work .
In Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi there are 756 males , 526 of whom , or 70 percent , have left to join the Red Army and to work .
Such large scale expansion of the Red Army would certainly have been impossible if the problem had not been solved thoroughly from the viewpoint of economy and production .
Only by correlating economic with political mobilization will it be possible to create a high tide of Red Army expansion and accomplish results like those accomplished in Ch &apos;ang @-@ wang and Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi townships .
Economic Life ( 1 ) Problem of Labor Force
Upper Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi : Of the total population of 2,318 ( during the uprising ) , 554 are males capable of labor ( 16 @-@ 55 years of age , same below ) , and 581 are females capable of labor .
Of these , 419 have joined the Red Army and 88 ( 66 males and 22 females ) have been transferred to outside areas for work .
Of the 554 males of the age group of 16 @-@ 55 and capable of labor , 485 ( 419 plus 66 ) have left for the Red Army or to work , and only 69 remain behind .
Thus the male labor force is only 11 percent of the female labor force of 559 ( 581 minus 22 ) .
There are 258 families of Red Army dependents in the whole township .
Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi : Of the total i.population of 2,610 , there are 1,207 males and females able to labor ( 765 males and 442 females ) .
Of these , 442 have joined the Red Army and 98 ( 91 males , 7 females ) have been transferred to outside areas to work .
Of the 765 males capable of labor , 533 have joined the Red Army or left for work , and only 232 remain in the township .
Thus the male labor force is only 33 percent of the female labor force of 435 ( 442 minus 7 ) .
There are 355 families of dependents of the Red Army in the whole township .
As a result , it is mainly women who farm the land .
In Upper Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi this year , about 300 women can use cattle and more than 60 can plant seedlings .
Before the uprising only 1 / 10 of these 300 , that is , 30 women , could use cattle .
The increase is obtained after several years &apos; effort-
Meanwhile , the &quot; old comrades &quot; are very energetic .
They make up a large number of those who cultivate hills and mountains and some can plant seedlings and harvest crops .
Children , too , take part in production .
Hence production is developing .
The development of production also depends on mutual adjustments of the labor force , apart from the participation of women , old persons and children in production .
Within the same village , families with labor power to spare help those with little labor power .
Within the same township , labor @-@ surplus villages help labor @-@ deficit villages .
Within the same district , labor @-@ surplus townships help labor @-@ deficit ones .
In this way , the labor force is adjusted with the district as a unit for the purpose of doing labor .
In addition , Party and League members also work &quot; Saturdays . &quot; Hence production gains still greater development .
Labor is adjusted mainly through the labor cooperative and land farming teams , whose task is to help Red Army dependents and make possible mutual aid among the masses .
Help for Red Army dependents : Carrying rice packs ( but not other food ) and farm implements for them .
The same when planting seedlings and harvesting .
Mutual @-@ aid among the masses : Daily wages agreed at 2 hao , the same for males and females , rush and slack seasons .
This has been the practice since 1930 .
When one Red Army dependent helps another , the pay is 1.5 man a day .
When Red Army dependents help other people , the pay is 2 mao a day .
When the masses help Red Army dependents , no wages will be paid .
The labor cooperative plans for the whole township .
There is a 5 @-@ man committee of the labor cooperative of the township which takes charge of the whole , and one committee member for each of the 4 villages who plans for the village ..
When labor is required , it must be procured through the village committee member .
There can be no private employment , otherwise labor adjustment may be upset .
Pay is agreed on between _ the employer and the employee without the intermediation of the cpmml . _ tte _ e member .
_ _ ~ ~ &quot; ~ &quot; ~ &quot; &quot; &quot;
The labor cooperative of this township was set up in 1931 .
It is the forerunner of the &quot; Labor Mutual @-@ Aid Cooperative &quot; which now functions all over the soviet area .
Each of the committee members keeps a record of those who are or are not able to labor , or who are short of labor power , so that labor can be immediately supplied whenever anyone wants to employ it .
Those who are unfamiliar with the situation may ask the intermediate team leader of the land farming team .
( There is one intermediate land farming team for each of the villages .
Five persons make a group , 2 groups of 10 persons make a squad , and 3 or 4 squads make an intermediate team ) .
The intermediate team leader also keeps a record .
&quot; It is agreed upon to combine the land farming team with the labor cooperative . &quot;
Production situation : After the uprising ( 1929 @-@ 1931 ) , production dropped by about 20 percent .
In 1932 half the loss , or 10 percent , was recovered .
This year ( 1933 ) it increased by 20 percent compared with that of last year , ( output of miscellaneous crops such as sweet potato , bean , taro and yam increased by 51 percent compared to that of last year ) exceeding that of the pre @-@ uprising year by 10 percent .
After the uprising many of the fields throughout the district were not tilled .
Last year a small part of them was redeveloped .
This year there has been a massive development to the extent of over 1,300 piculs .
More hills have been developed than fields , as hills make up three @-@ fourths and fields only one @-@ fourth of the land developed .
Because all fields have been opened , hills are now developed .
Not a single ridge that divides the fields is not planted with miscellaneous crops .
All fields suitable for sweet potatoes are planted with sweet potatoes .
Female comrades &quot; vie &quot; with one another in developing hills .
Everyone wants to do it .
The effect of the competition is great .
The district was far short of grain before the uprising ( and besides , many people made flour in those days ) .
Last year there was enough for consumption , and this year there is a surplus .
Now no one in the whole district makes flour or &quot; cakes , &quot; and no one produces liquor by distillation .
( 2 ) Consumer Cooperatives
There are 14 consumer cooperatives in the 8 townships of the whole district .
Two are in Upper Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi :
One is an oil , salt and meat cooperative .
It originally operated on a capital of 4 yuan , which was subsequently increased to 185 yuan at 50 cents a share .
It was organized in October 1930 .
There was a distribution of dividends in July 1933 .
Each share was paid 50 cents .
One person is regularly posted in the cooperative .
He is helped by two others on market days .
The other is a cloth cooperative .
It originally operated on a capital of 144 yuan which was subsequently increased to 255 yuan at 1 yuan a share .
This was formed at the same time as the former .
There was a distribution of dividends in September 1933 .
Each share was paid 1 yuan .
Two persons are regularly posted in the cooperative .
They are helped by another on market days .
Three are in Lower Ts &quot; ai @-@ hsi :
One cloth cooperative : Original capital 120 yuan , subsequently increased to 240 yuan at 1 yuan a share .
It was formed in January 1930 .
There was a distribution of dividends in February 1932 .
Each share was paid 1 yuan .
Two persons are regularly posted in the cooperative .
One oil , salt and meat cooperative : Original capital 35 yuan , subsequently increased to 157 yuan at 50 cents a share .
It was formed in October 1929 .
There was a dividend distribution in March 1933 .
Each share was paid 50 cents .
Two persons are regularly posted in the cooperative .
On market days they have a helper .
One beancurd , candy and piglet cooperative : Original capital 125 yuan , subsequently increased to 180 yuan at 50 cents a share .
It was formed in January 1931 .
There was a dividend distribution in February 1933 .
Each share was paid 50 cents .
Three persons are regularly posted in the office .
Accounts of the cooperatives are audited twice a month ( auditor eats , at home after checking accounts ) .
Members meet once a month ( no meals provided ) .
Officers are elected once every 3 months at members meeting .
New officers are elected immediately to fill the vacancies of those who have been transferred to county or district cooperatives , or who are young and have joined the Red Army ( in which case older persons take their place ) , or who do not want to serve another term .
In practice , most of them serve consecutive terms and few are transferred .
Only dependents of Red Army men who are in financial difficulty may buy on credit .
They may pay on
the next or the next two market days , but must pay on the third market day ( there is a 10 @-@ day interval between 2 market days ) Debts may be repaid in kind , e.g. , .
in rice , beans , etc .
Outstanding debts not paid on market days shall be fully paid in July and October each year .
Sixty percent of the families of Upper Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi and 90 percent of those of Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi have joined the cooperatives .
Red Army dependents -are given first priority when buying goods in short supply .
Next come members of the cooperatives , and lastly non @-@ members .
Price : Red Army dependents ( those who have certificates ) are given a 5 percent discount on the market price .
No discount is given members of the cooperatives .
The same applies to Red Army dependents from other townships or districts .
Red Army dependents of the old country , Han @-@ yang and Kuan @-@ chuang districts sometimes come to buy goods .
&quot; Cooperatives are tops &quot; this is public opinion .
With the single exception of a medicine store kept by a Kiangsi native , there is no private store that sells goods from outside areas in the whole district .
( This situation is brought about by gradually whittling down the number of privately owned stores ) .
But on market days one or two persons privately sell salt .
There are also those who still privately sell bean @-@ curd and other native produce .
( 3 ) Food Grain Cooperatives
These were formerly called Grain Adjustment Bureaus .
They began to be formed in 1930 , with capital raised by the masses .
Funds were not generally collected , but were collected only from families who were comparatively well off .
Each share was 1 yuan .
One adjustment bureau was formed in each township .
There were 8 bureaus in the district , with a total capital of 1,810 yuan .
Method of adjustment : When buying paddy from the masses every year , the bureau gets 2 sheng less than the private buyer for every yuan &apos;s worth .
For example , a private buyer buys paddy at 1 tou 7 sheng per yuan , while the adjustment bureau buys only 1 tou and 5 sheng per yuan .
Grain is offered for sale first to Red Army dependents and next to the masses who are in difficulty .
Whether the masses are in difficulty or not is decided by the conference of township representatives after investigation .
Grain is sold not at the market price , but at cost after a slight deduction of losses and spoilage .
For example , when grain is bought at 1 tou and 5 sheng per yuan , it is sold at 1 tou sheng and 5 ho , 5 ho being deducted for loss and spoilage .
Red Army dependents who do not have cash and the masses who are particularly in difficulty may borrow grain , to be repaid in kind at harvest time without interest .
Every year when the work of collecting or selling grain is completed , the township soviet tell the masses to elect representatives who will check the accounts with the responsible person of the adjustment bureau .
After that , a statement of account is made public .
Every
year after fall grain is collected , measured and stored in .
the granaries , which are then sealed by the township soviet with long strips of paper .
Grain is sold once or twice in spring and summer .
When the masses need grain , the granaries will be opened so the masses may buy grain .
In general grain is sold every year in March when it is planting time and in May , when last season &apos;s grain is consumed while the new crop is not yet ready for harvesting .
The bureaus were renamed grain cooperatives in February this year , but the organization remains the same .
Since the launching of the economic construction campaign this year , the grain cooperatives of all the townships have been expanded .
For example , the grain cooperative of Upper Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi originally had a capital of 215 yuan .
Its capital is now increased by 203 yuan to 418 yuan .
That of Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi originally had a capital of 137 yuan .
It is increased by 200 yuan to 337 yuan .
The 5 @-@ man committee of the adjustment bureau and a chairman are regularly posted at the bureau .
They get paid for their meals .
In May this year there was famine in the two townships of Shang @-@ ts &apos;un and Chang @-@ wen ( now incorporated in T &apos;ung @-@ hsien District ) .
The two townships are mostly bamboo hills .
Each person gets only 1 tan of arable land , and the paper @-@ making industry has failed .
The grain adjustment bureaus of all other townships of the district cooperated in giving relief .
The price of paddy was then 8 sheng per yuan , but the adjustment bureaus lent these townships paddy at last fall &apos;s price of 1 tou and 8 sheng per yuan , to be repaid after fall .
The whole district lent a total of 36 tan , in addition , miscellaneous food ( dried sweet potatoes , etc ) and cash were collected for relief .
As a result , no one starved .
There has been no famine in the other townships of Ts &apos;ai @-@ hai District this year , thanks to the efforts of the adjustment bureaus
In Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi there is also a &quot; Rice Sales Cooperative &quot; with a capital of 130 yuan at 50 cents a share .
This is set up exclusively for the convenience of Red Army units in transit , travelers , government personnel and the masses victimized by disasters who went to buy grain .
The cooperative is government by a committee of 5 , who are not regularly posted at the cooperative .
On market days one person works there for a half a day .
At other times its work is carried on by some other consumer cooperative .
The worker who buys rice for sale is paid his wages plus money for his meals .
Ho dividend is distributed .
The ordinary masses rarely buy their rice here .
Only 1 or 2 percent of them buy rice here .
Rice is sold at market price .
Since this cooperative was set up with capital raised by the masses , Red Armymen and disaster victims no longer have to buy rice from door to door .
( 4 ) Draft Cattle Cooperatives
This cooperative has been set up only by Upper and Lower Ts &apos; ai @-@ hsi townships in the whole district .
Each cooperative owns 3 head of cattle .
About 20 percent of the families of the two townships have no cattle .
No solution has as yet been found to this situation .
( 5 ) Everyday Life
Rice : Before the uprising , poor peasants and hired hands had an average of only 3 months supply of rice a year for their own consumption .
In the remaining 9 months they had to live on miscellaneous crops .
In the period before harvest , when the old stock was exhausted and the new crop was not yet ready , they had to subsist on goat weed and some on chaff .
Now they have 6 months reserve of rice and another 6 months reserve of miscellaneous crops , so they have enough to last them a whole year .
The region produces little rice , so the people still have to depend on miscellaneous crops half the time .
Production of miscellaneous crops has now increased .
Before the uprising , a meal was far from satisfying .
Now people can eat their fill .
Moreover , they have a surplus which they can sell to the Red Army or use for paying land tax , buying public bonds or exchanging for oil and salt .
In short , the food situation has improved 100 percent ( 6 @-@ month reserve of rice compared with 3 @-@ month reserve ) .
Meat : Before the uprising , poor peasants and hired hands consumed on average of 1 yuan ( ta @-@ yang ) of meat a year per capita .
Now it is 2 yuan , an increase of 100 percent .
Before the uprising only 60 families in a 100 kept pigs .
Now 95 families in a 100 keep pigs .
Clothing : Before the uprising each person could make an average of one suit every 2 years .
After the uprising each person could make an average of 1 1 / 2 suits every year , an increase of 300 percent .
This year the situation has again changed .
Cloth is scarce as a result of the blockade , so each person can make an average of only half a suit , a return to the pre @-@ upsiring status .
Before the uprising an unlined suit was worth 18 mao ( 15 mao for cloth and
3 mao for labor ) .
Last year one suit was worth 21 mao ( 17 mao for cloth and
4 mao for labor ) or equal to 1.5 yuan .
This year one suit is worth 34 mao ( 30 mao for cloth and 4 mao for labor , or the equivalent of 2.4 yuan in ta @-@ yang ) .
Counterrevolution has jacked up the price of our clothing to this extent I
Salt : Before the uprising each person consumed an average of 1 catty of salt a month .
In November this year each person consumed only 3.2 liang of salt a month .
In other words , a family of 5 who consumed 5 catties of salt a month before the uprising consumed only 1 catty in November this year .
There will be no salt for anyone unless the Kuomintang is overthrown !
Oil : Before the uprising the per capita consumption ( of wood oil from Kiatigsi and local lard ) was 6 liang a month .
There is now no reduction or increase .
But because wood oil from Kiangsi is reduced , the masses are consuming more lard .
( 6 ) Prices
PaddyBefore the uprising it was 10 yuan , per tan ( 100 catties ) .
In 1929 it was 2.5 yuan .
In 1930 it was 5 yuan .
In 1932 it was 6.2 yuan .
In May 1933 it was 10 yuan , but in October it was 5 yuan .
PorkBefore the uprising it was 1 yuan for 2.5 catties ( with bone ) .
Now it is also 1 yuan for 2.5 catties ( but without bone ) .
FishOwing to the blockade after the uprising , there is no fry from Chiu @-@ chiang ( via Wu @-@ p &apos;ing County ) .
The ponds are empty .
There is no market .
Chicken8 mao per catty , the same before and after the uprising .
Duck4 mao per catty , about the same before and after the uprising .
Chicken eggs3 for 1 mao , about the same before and after the uprising .
Duck eggs3 for 1 mao , about the same before and after the uprising .
LardSame as pork .
LimeNot used in the fields , but used for paper @-@ making .
One yuan buys 1 tan ( 80 catties ) , about the same before and after the uprising .
BeansBefore the uprising it was 10 yuan a tan ( 8 tou ) .
In 1932 it was 20 yuan .
This year it is 8 yuan .
TobaccoBefore the uprising it was 1 mao for 2 liang .
Now it is 1 mao for 1.6 liang .
Tea1 yuan buys 3.5 catties , about the same before and after the uprising .
Rapeseed oilBefore the uprising it was 1 yuan for 3.5 catties .
This spring it was 2.5 catties .
This winter it is 1 catty and 13 liang .
PaperBefore the uprising grass paper was 4.5 yuan a roll ( 40 catties ) .
In 1931 it was 6 yuan .
In 1932 it was 5 yuan .
In 1933 it was 1.5 yuan .
As a result , no one makes paper now .
TimberCannot be exported , so no market .
Paper and timber constitute the largest exports of the region .
Now both have failed .
The hateful Kuomintang blockade !
Wood oilBefore the uprising wood oil was 1 yuan for 3.5 catties .
Now little comes here , so the people have to consume more lard .
IronPrice has doubled compared with that before the uprising .
ClothBefore thp uprising cotton cloth was 1 yuan for 1 bolt ( 2 change 3 ch &apos;ih ) .
Inl932itwas 1 yuan and &apos; 4 mao for 1 bolt .
This year it was 2 yuan and 2 mao for 1 bolt .
SaltBefore the uprising it was 1 yuan for 10 .catties.
From 1930 up to spring 1932 it was still 1 yuan for 10 catties .
That summer it was 1 yuan for 7 catties .
In 1933 it was 1 yuan for 1 catty .
In November 1 yuan could buy only 14 liang .
The biggest problem is to break the blockade .
KeroseneBefore the uprising 50 percent of the families used kerosene for their lamps .
It was then 1 yuan for 7 catties and 14 liang .
In 1933 1 yuan could only buy 1 catty and 5 liang .
As a result , with the exception of public offices , no one uses it .
The people all use &quot; pine light . &quot;
FirewoodBefore the uprising 1 catty was 2 chips .
Last year it was 3 chips .
This year it is from 5 to 9 chips .
Mao @-@ yangSame before and after the uprising .
Each mao is 16 catties .
Silver dollarsMiscellaneous silver dollars worth 13.5 mao each ; silver dollars with Yuan Shih @-@ k ? ai head worth 14 mao each .
Soviet notes have the same value .
Only soviet notes are now in circulation .
Silver dollars have completely vanished .
It is Kuomintang sabotage again !
Economic Bonds
The 8 townships of the newly demarcated Ts &apos;ai @-@ hai District consist of 2,188 families of 8,782 persons , who together have undertaken to buy bonds with a total value of 13,600 yuan .
About 1,000 yuan worth of bonds still remains &apos; to be sold .
Upper Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi township , with 513 families of 2,318 persons , has taken up 4,000 yuan .
Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi township , with 503 families of 2,660 persons , has taken up 4,146 yuan .
Methods :
( 1 ) Mobilization at Party and League rallies .
( 2 ) Mobilization at meetings separately held .by all organizations .
( 3 ) Mobilization at meeting of representatives of township Soviets .
( 4 ) A mass meeting at the village level was held exclusively for propaganda , not for the sale of bonds .
( 5 ) A mass rally was held at the township level to sell bonds .
Over 1,500 worth of bonds was sold in each of the two townships .
Work not yet finished ,
( 6 ) Sales committee of township representatives ( 3 from each village ) and propaganda team ( organized by township with 5 persons from each village ) carried out propaganda from door to door .
( 7 ) At a rally of electors , over 600 yuan of bonds was sold in Upper Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi and another 1,600 yuan was sold in Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi .
Up to that time over 2,000 yuan was sold in Upper TsTai @-@ hsi , with over 1,000 yuan still unsold .
Over 3,000 yuan was sold in Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi , with about 900 yuan still unsold .
( 8 ) After that the representatives , sales committee and propaganda team carried out door @-@ to @-@ door agitation , and sold all the bonds .
The people pledged to buy the remaining bonds , but certificates had not yet been received .
The buying of bonds was entirely voluntary without coercion .
At every one of the meetings there was talk about economic construction .
Because the county trade bureau has been set up and the masses can buy salt and cloth , they all the more realize the importance of the economic bonds .
We repeat .
Only by coordinating economic construction with political mobilization is it possible to create a higher upsurge of the expansion of the Red Army and spur the broad masses to the battle front .
After the adult and young males have left Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi en masse to join the Red Army or for work , production exceeds that before the uprising by 10 percent .
All wasteland is developed , so it is necessary to carry development to the hills .
There is not a single piece of arable land that is not planted with some crop .
The life of the masses is improved by more than 100 percent .
The labor cooperative ( called labor mutual @-@ aid cooperative elsewhere ) , consumer cooperative and grain cooperative have organized .-.the economic life of the masses of the whole township .
Economic organization has reached a very high level , so Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi becomes the first glorious model in this respect throughout the soviet area .
This economic achievement buoys up the spirit of the masses .
They can now take up arms and go to the front for the defense and development of the soviet area entirely free of worry for their dependents at home .
Of the total population of 4,928 of the two townships , 1,018 ( 485 from Upper Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi and 533 from Lower Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi ) have left to join the Red Army or for work .
This ironclad fact gives us an effective weapon with which to smash the hutubuggery of all opportunities , who for example declare that economic construction is impossible during the Civil War , that the life of the masses of the soviet area has not improved , that the masses are unwilling to join the Red Army , or that expansion of the Red Army will leave no manpower for production .
We call upon the hundreds and thousands of townships throughout the Soviet area to emulate the townships of Ch &apos;ang @-@ waug , Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi and Shih @-@ shui .
We hereby solemnly place the glorious achievements of these several townships before all the worker @-@ peasant masses , so they may build the several thousand townships like Chfang @-@ wang , Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi and Shih @-@ shui and make them a strong advanced position for winning victory in all China .

MASS WORK IN THE LAND INVESTIGATION MOVEMENT 1933
&#91; Text &#93; The land investigation movement is a violent , ruthless class struggle .
It is necessary to mobilize the largest number of the masses to take part with fervor in the struggle and form a mass movement , so as to insure the correct implementation of the class line and attain the object of striking down the remnant forces of feudalism .
All bureaucratic modes of work that are alien to the masses are the greatest enemy of the land investigation movement .
Mass work in the land investigation involves mainly the telling apart of classes , confiscation and redistribution according to classes , correct leadership for labor unions and poor peasant corps , etc .
Discussing Classes ( Doing Propaganda )
Strategy of the land investigation movement : In order to weaken rich peasants and liquidate landlords by making workers the leaders , relying on poor peasants and uniting with middle peasants .
Content of the propaganda : Explaining this strategy very clearly to the masses .
In order to explain this strategy , it is necessary to make clear the difference between landlords , rich peasants , middle peasants , poor peasants and workers .
In the course of the explanation , it is necessary to demonstrate how landlords are feudal exploiters and rich peasants are semi @-@ feudal exploiters , so that only by adopting the policy of liquidating landlords and weakening rich peasants will it be possible to give all the benefit of the land revolution to middle peasants , poor peasants and workers .
But there is a difference between rich peasants and landlords .
Rich peasants do no labor themselves .
So against landlords a policy of liquidation is adopted , but against rich peasants a policy of weakening them is adopted .
Hence the tendency to liquidate rich peasants is wrong .
At the same time , rich peasants should not be treated as landlords .
Strategy toward middle peasants : Uniting with middle peasants is the innermost core of the strategy of the land revolution .
Support or opposition by middle peasants makes the difference between success or failure of the land revolution .
Hence it is necessary to explain this strategy to
the masses again and again , and make it clear that impingement on the interests of middle peasants will absolutely not be allowed .
To unite with middle peasants and avoid impinging on their interests , it is necessary to make clear what middle peasants are with the example of &quot; well @-@ off middle peasants . &quot; It is necessary to make clear emphatically the boundary line between rich peasants and middle peasants , so as to stabilize the well @-@ off middle peasants .
It is necessary to expose the deceiving of middle peasants by landlords and rich peasants , so middle peasants may free themselves from the influence of landlords and rich peasants , rally around the poor peasants , and together with them wage struggle against landlords .
It is necessary to expose every deceptive slogan put forward by the landlords and rich peasants , and explain it broadly to the masses .
Care must be taken against the use by landlords and rich peasants and clannish , local backward ideas to deceive the middle and poor peasants and sabotage the movement .
It is necessary to make clear that land investigation is a weapon for smashing the enemy &apos;s encirclement and suppression campaign , because it will wipe out the remnant forces of feudalism .
Once enemy troublemakers concealed in the soviet area are removed and the revolutionary fervor of the broad masses is heightened , expansion of the Red Army , economic construction and other work will be easier to carry out .
Concrete slogans should be put forward according to local conditions .
In a backward village , for example , it is necessary to find the cause for the backwardness and put forward concrete slogans for mobilizing the masses .
Again , if there is a reactionary landlord in the area who intimidates the masses so they dare not rise to struggle actively , it will be necessary to put forward slogans mentioning the landlord by name .
Furthermore , if some local government personnel commit the grave error of drifting away from the masses so the masses are dissatisfied , propaganda will have to be done by exposing the error of such personnel so as to mobilize the masses for struggle .
All the above concerns the content of propaganda .
The following will deal with the way of doing propaganda .
Propaganda on land ownership investigation should be directed first to township @-@ level cadres ( representatives of township Soviets and responsible officers of all mass organizations ) to make them understand first so they may in turn do propaganda among the masses .
Second , to conferences of labor unions and poor peasant corps to make the members understand ; and third , to mass rallies in villages to make every one of the masses understand .
Propaganda makers are chiefly township @-@ level activist cadres , who will prepare to speak at mass meetings .
Next , propaganda teams will be organized which will speak to the masses after some training .
Modes of propaganda : first , speech making , second , posting notices ; third , writing slogans ; fourth , distributing leaflets , fifth , staging new plays ; sixth , writing articles , and so forth .
Investigating Classes
Land investigation is investigation of class status , not investigation of land holdings by the mou .
This will create fear among the masses and is absolutely wrong .
Investigation of class status is to find out landlords , rich peasants , exploiters and those who are hidden among the peasants but who are not peasants .
It is investigation of this handful of people , not investigation into the class status of middle and poor peasants .
Therefore , there must not be door @-@ to @-@ door investigation , which will create fear among the masses and is absolutely wrong .
Investigation of class status must be preceded by a period of propaganda , that is , a period of telling the classes .
Investigation without first universally speaking about classes will create fear among the masses , and is absolutely wrong .
In the investigation of classes , members of labor unions and poor peasant groups and large numbers of the masses must be mobilized to do the investigating .
Results of the investigation should be immediately reported to poor peasant corps and the land investigation committee .
Investigation should not be done by only a few people , because this will create fear among the masses and is absolutely wrong .
Investigation of classes must be made thoroughly .
No matter whether the ones investigated are landlords or rich peasants , the way they exploited others and the way they lived in the past must be found out in great detail .
Only by so doing can they be willing to admit their crime and the masses can be satisfied .
If a conclusion is made after a cursory examination , it will be easy to make mistakes .
The persons investigated will be unwilling to admit their guilt and the masses will not be satisfied .
This will hamper the land investigation movement .
In dealing with middle peasants , all the more care must be exercised so as not to label them rich peasants or rich peasants as landlords .
All information gathered from a family in a class investigation must be written down in a &quot; class status investigation form , &quot; so the people may comment on it and checks can be made in the future .
If details are only memorized , or if only a few lines are scribbled in a notebook , the information may be easily lost .
That will be bad .
Passing Class Status
Passing class status means deciding a person &apos;s class status .
Because that will decide the person &apos;s life or death , extreme care should be taken .
Everything must be made clear before a case can be put forward for passing .
Order of passing : First the poor peasant groups must hold a general meeting .
After discussion at the meeting and the cases are approved by the majority by a show of hands , they can be considered to have passed the poor peasant groups .
If there are any doubts about a case , it should not be passed at the meeting , &quot; but should be discussed again at the next meeting .
Second , the township land investigation committee will examine the view of the poor peasant groups .
If it is found correct , it will be passed ; if incorrect , it will be rectified .
If in doubt , another investigation should be made .
Third , it is the turn of the district land department .
If it cannot make a decision , the cases will be- referred to the district land investigation committee .
If the district committee in turn cannot make a decision , they will be referred to the county land department .
Fourth , the village mass meeting .
A mass meeting must be held in the village of the person investigated , when he will report details of his exploitation of others and his way of life , to see if the masses approve of his case .
If they approve , the case is passed .
If they do not approve , another investigation should be made .
There must be no forced passing .
If passage is forced , the masses will not be satisfied .
It will be command @-@ istn , which must be resolutely and firmly opposed .
The above four steps of passing a person &apos;s class status are indispensable .
Passing at a mass meeting is particularly important .
In some places land has been confiscated without first passing a mass meeting .
That is wrong .
If a case has been passed wrongly , such as passing a middle peasant for a rich peasant , a rich peasant for a landlord , or a landlord for a rich peasant , the decision should be overturned .
It will be necessary to explain at a mass meeting the past error and the reason for correction , so as to make the masses satisfied .
In overturning a wrong decision , restitution of land and property must be made to the wronged person if he is a middle peasant .
Even if his land has already been redistributed , it must be resumed and given back to him .
If the person is a rich peasant , restitution of land should also be made to him if such land is available .
If there is really no land available , some other way should be worked out in the future for him .
Such restitution always wins the approval of the masses .
It is completely wrong to let errors go unremedied .
Confiscation and Redistribution
Confiscation of a landlord &apos;s land and property and confiscation of a rich peasant ? s land and surplus cattle , farm implements and houses should &quot; be carried out only after approval by the masses at a village mass meeting .
There must be no confiscation without prior consent from the masses .
There must be no confiscation at night .
All property confiscated from landlords , with the exception of ready cash and valuables which must be handed over to the finance department of the government , should be distributed among the masses .
This is one way of increasing the enthusiasm of the masses for struggle .
While the village mass meeting is in progress , an ad hoc committee to take charge of confiscation and distribution should be elected .
Confiscation should be made immediately and so should distribution .
There must be no delay in confiscation or distribution .
Property should not be brought to the government office and then distributed after discussion .
Distribution should be made within the village where the confiscation is made and must not be equally distributed in the whole township .
( This does not apply to the property of big landlords ) .
Pigs , chicken , etc .
should be cooked and then consumed at the mass meeting .
They must not be eaten by a small number of work personnel .
&#91; EditorTs note : There is no paragraph 6 in the original &#93;
Government workers are the ones most eager to demand a share of the distribution so as to set an example .
It articles of everyday use are extremely short , the consent of the masses must be obtained and distribution should be approved at the mass meeting .
Work personnel must be prevented from freely taking things .
With the consent of the masses , those who receive a share of the confiscated land should form a cattle cooperative so they may jointly use the draft cattle and important farm implements confiscated .
It is not right to delay distribution of land that is confiscated .
That should be distributed as soon as possible after setting aside Red Army common land and public business land .
Land should be distributed first to those who received no or very little land in past distributions .
If there is land left after that , it should be equally distributed among the villages as a unit .
Forests , fish ponds , houses , latrines should likewise be promptly distributed among the masses .
Every time a distribution is made , while the enthusiasm of the masses for struggle is at its height , slogans of Red Army expansion and development of cooperatives should be opportunely put forward so the masses may be led to take part enthusiastically in the revolutionary war and the construction of the soviet .
Labor Unions and Poor Peasant Groups
Optimum results can be obtained from talking about classes , investigation of class status , passing of class status , confiscation and distribution and other work only by mobilizing the labor unions and poor peasant groups .
Labor unions should be leaders in class struggle in rural villages and poor peasant corps the pillars and keystone of rural class struggle .
Correct development of the land investigation movement depends on the labor unions directing their own members to join the poor peasant groups and play an active role in the corps .
Poor peasant groups should be developed , so they may become organizations which the broad mass of poor peasants can freely join .
Poor peasant groups must be purged of concealed bad elements .
Poor peasant corps should frequently hold meetings during the land investigation movement .
They should grasp the movement as their central work .
Middle peasants should be made to rally around the poor peasant groups .
They should be induced to attend meetings of the poor peasant groups to listen to the proceedings .
In leading the work of land investigation and struggle , the labor unions and poor peasant groups must not run counter to the principles mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs .
Only by mobilizing the broad masses in accordance with the aforementioned strategy and methods will it be possible to obtain satisfactory results in the land investigation movement .
Any failure to do propaganda or to do it properly , seriously and universally , and any failure to comply with the class line and mass line and to obtain the approval or consent of the masses in the investigation and passing of class status and in the work of confiscation and distribution will not achieve results in the land investigation movement .
On the contrary , it will make the masses dissatisfied and hamper the progress of the land investigation movement .
Therefore , opposition to Leftist opportunism in the movement which trespasses against middle peasants and wipes out rich peasants , to Rightist opportunism which shelters landlords and rich peasants , and to bureaucratic methods of leadership and work is an essential condition for the correct development of the land investigation movement .

FIRST CABLE .MESSAGE FROM PROVISIONAL CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TO FUKIEN PEOPLE &apos;S REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT AND THE 19TH ROUTE ARMY
20 December 1933
&#91; Text &#93; Fukien People &apos;s Revolutionary Government and Officers and Men of the People &apos;s Revolutionary Army :
More than a month has passed since representatives of the Soviet Government and Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army and your representatives concluded an anti @-@ Japan , anti @-@ Chiang draft agreement , but up to now we have not seen you taking active anti @-@ Japan , anti @-@ Chiang action , nor have we seen any concrete , practical work on your part in mobilizing the masses for struggle and arming them to oppose Japan and Chiang .
On the other hand , Chiang Kai @-@ shek has already sent three columns to attack Foochow and Yen @-@ p &apos;ing , and Japanese imperialism is already prepared to occupy Foochow and Amoy in response to Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s military action .
You and the broad mass of people of Fukien are in the midst of extreme danger .
The Soviet Government and Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army want to tell you solemnly that any passivity , hesitancy and indecision in the face of such danger will be a very great crime against the Chinese revolution .
Therefore , the Soviet Central Government and Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army demand that you take immediate , resolute action in accordance with the basic principles decided upon in our anti @-@ Japan , anti @-@ Chiang draft agreement , concentrate all your armed forces and immediately begin an anti @-@ Chiang battle of decision .
At the same time you must resolutely mobilize and arm the broad masses , organize a truly popular revolutionary army of volunteers , and truly give the people the democratic rights of speech , publication , assembly , association and strike to develop mass struggle against the Japanese and Chiang .
We believe that we can win ultimate victory only by relying on the strength of the millions of broad masses .
Our Soviet Government and Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army are ready to join forces with you any time and conclude with you an operational military agreement to oppose and strike down our common enemies &apos;Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai @-@ shekTs Kuomintang government in Nanking , We hope you will let us know your decisions as soon as possible .

SECOND CABLE MESSAGE FROM THE PROVISIONAL CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TO FUKIEN PEOPLE &apos;S REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE &apos;S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY
13 January 1934
&#91; Text &#93; Committee Members Li , Ch &apos;en and Chiang of the People &apos;s Government :
Judged on the basis of the present situation , Foochow is about to fall and the People &apos;s Government is in danger .
In accordance with our bilateral agreement of the past , the Soviet Central Government ventures to make the following emergency proposals to your esteemed government in the spirit of the anti @-@ Japan , anti @-@ Chiang united front :
The People &apos;s Government should immediately put in practice the people &apos;s democratic rights it has promised in its declaration and in the agreement .
The People &apos;s Government should immediately arm the masses of Foochow and its environs , Ch &apos;uan- ^ chou , Chang @-@ chou and other places , and encourage and support the broad masses in their participation in the anti @-@ Japan , anti @-@ Chiang front to defend Foochow , Ch &apos;uan @-@ chou , Chang @-@ chou and other areas .
Encourage the masses to organize at once anti @-@ Japan , anti @-@ Chiang fight @-@ ing bodies , &quot; but do not obstruct or ban the development of such organizations under the excuse of the critical state of the war .
There should be practical encouragement to armed organizations of the masses and their anti- ^ Japan , anti @-@ Chiang activities in enemy Chiang &apos;s rear ( .such as the coastal areas of Fukien and Chekiang ) .
There should be determination to purge from your ranks those elements who are ready to capitulate to Chiang Kai @-@ shek or who want to ask imperialism for protection .
Conduct propaganda among all officers and men of the 19th Route Army and let them know that only by cooperating to the end with the Soviet and the Red Army can they oppose the Japanese and Chiang .
Take all effective measures and united military action .
Obviously , Chiang Kai @-@ shek and Japanese imperialism are coordinating their action with the common object of wiping out the 19th Route Army .
If your esteemed government wishes indeed to implement what you have advocated , then our above @-@ mentioned proposals will be the only way to save the People &apos;s Government and the 19th Route Army from the present danger .
They will also be the final test of your esteemed government1s resolve to fulfill the promises made in your own declaration and in the agreement .
It should be realized that if an anti @-@ Japan , anti @-@ Chiang front of the masses and the armed forces is truly established , Chiang Kai @-@ shek and the Japanese imperialists will not be able to rule in peace for long even if Foochow falls , and this united front will undoubtedly develop steadily day by day throughout the country .
Moreover , if your esteemed government is willing to arm the masses and encourage the people of Fukien , firest of all the people of Foochow , to defend themselves , there will be new development in the situation and Foochow may not necessarily fall .
The matter is urgent .
We hope you will consider it and let us have your reply .

A SOLEMN OPENING SPEECH OUTLINE OF CHAIRMAN MAO &apos;S SPEECH ( AT THE SECOND ALL @-@ SOVIET CONGRESS )
22 January 1934
&#91; Text &#93; Comrades !
On behalf of the Central Executive Committee I declare the Second National Soviet Congress open .
( Band plays )
Comrades !
Today is the day the Second National Worker @-@ Peasant @-@ Soldier Soviet Congress opens .
On behalf of the Central Executive Committee I give the whole body of delegates the revolutionary salute !
Comrades !
It has been 2 years and 2 months since the First National Soviet Congress .
Developments in the past 2 years have completely shown and proved that the counterrevolutionary ruling classes are further shaken and collapsing , while the soviet movement and the nationwide revolutionary struggle are developing greatly .
China is a country oppressed and invaded by imperialism , a country in which the Kuomintang Government of the landlord - bourgeoisie carries out slaughter , repression and enslavement .
The vast territory of the country is surrendered by the Kuomintang to the imperialists , so that all China is being threatened with partition and joint rule by Imperialism and is rapidly approaching a state of doom .
In such a situation China &apos;s toiling worker @-@ peasant masses , led by the Chinese Communist Party , have united and armed themselves and created their own government and state .
Our First All @-@ Soviet Congress declared the inauguration of this state , which is our Chinese Soviet Republic .
Since then there has been extremely acute opposition between two governments in all China .
Developments of the revolution in the past 2 years have even more developed the revolutionary situation throughout the country .
The broad worker @-@ peasant masses , rallying around the banner of the Soviet , have been attacking our enemies , imperialism and the Kuomintang .
We have won great victories in the past 2 years .
In the face of our victories imperialism and the Kuomintang are trembling .
Following three &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaigns they have organized the 4th and even the 5th &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaigns .
But we have shattered the four &quot; encirclement and
suppression &quot; campaigns of the enemies , and have already won an initial victory in smashing the 5th &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign .
At present we are in a battle of decision against the 5th &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign and in a most crucial moment .
In the past 2 years the Red Army of the whole country has won a great victory in the bloody struggle .
In this many of our comrades have shed their last drop of blood and gloriously sacrificed themselves for the Soviet .
Many of those who led the revolutionary struggle in Kuomintang and White areas have been murdered by the Kuoraintang .
Among these comrades were Huang Kung @-@ lueh , Chao Po @-@ sheng , Wei Pa @-@ ch &apos;un , Yun Tai @-@ ying , Ts &apos;ai Ho @-@ sen , Teng Chung @-@ hsia , Ch &apos;en Yuan @-@ tao , Lu I , Shen Tse @-@ min , Wang Liang , Hu A @-@ lin , Chang Hsi @-@ lung , Wu Kao @-@ ch &apos;un , P &apos;eng Ao and others .
They gloriously sacrificed themselves under the enemy &apos;s bullets and butcher &apos;s knife on the fronts and various frontlines .
I propose that we show our grief and respect for these comrades by observing a 3 @-@ minute silence .
( All delegates stand up in silence for 3 minutes )
The tasks of the Second National Soviet Congress are to utterly smash the enemy &apos;s 5th &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign , to push the soviet movement all over the country and to oppose the scheme and vicious plot of imperialism and the Kuomintang to put China into extinction .
Our Congress shoulders a great responsibility .
Our Congress should call upon the toiling worker @-@ peasant masses throughout the Soviet area and all China to struggle for expansion of the Red Army into 1 million ironlike men .
We should call upon the masses throughout the Soviet area and all China to arm themselves , concentrate all forces and shatter the 5th &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign to win the biggest , most thorough victory of the revolutionary war and victory of the revolution in all China .
Our Congress is the supreme organ of state power of the whole country .
has immense strength to solve these problems .
We believe it certainly
can solve them and is fully confident of doing so .
Our Congress will make
the 5th &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign end in utter rout , develop
the revolution in the whole country , extend the territory of the Soviet to
all regions ruled by the Kuomintang , and unfurl the red flag all over the country .
Let us shout :
Long live the Second National Soviet Congress !
Long live the soviet new China !

The Current Situation and the Victory of the Soviet Movement
Two full years have passed since the first All @-@ Soviet Congress .
The development of revolutionary events during these 2 years has fully revealed the further vacillation and collapse of the Kuomintang rule , and the accelerated unfolding of the soviet movement and its victory !
The period we are in today is a period of further intensification of the Chinese revolutionary situation , and it is precisely also the interim of the world &apos;s entrance into the new period of war and revolution .
The confrontation of the socialist world and the capitalist world has become extremely acute now .
On the one hand the socialist economy of the Soviet Union has achieved final consolidation , its First Five @-@ Year Plan was completed within 4 years , and great achievements were attained in the first year of its Second Five @-@ Year Plan .
The Soviet Union very early eliminated unemployment , and the cultural level and standards of living of its entire working people have been greatly heightened .
The Soviet Union &apos;s national defense has been greatly consolidated .
With the support of the people throughout the world , the peaceful policies of the Soviet Union have been successful everywhere , and even the most obdurate U.S.
imperialism has been compelled to establish diplomatic relations .
Por the capitalist world it was a picture of another kind , the economic crisis has reached its apex , the entire production of the capitalist world has dropped to an unprecedented low , its unemployed workers are counted by the tens of millions , the temporary stability of capitalism has ended , and the peril of capitalism in general has entered a new stage .
The various imperialist countries are frantically preparing for war .
The result of Japanese imperialism1s occupation of Manchuria was to bring about an unfolding of contradictions among the various countries on a new basisespecially the contradictions between Japan and the United Statesand the imperialist bandit war for redistributing the world is threatening all the people .
Nevertheless , imperialism is again attempting to mitigate the contradictions within its ranks for awhile and find a way out by sacrificing the Soviet Union and China .
The preparations for war against the Soviet Union have never ceased .
The war to divide China and attack the Chinese Revolution is now being carried out even more openly .
The revolutionary movement of the oppressed people of the world and the world &apos;s proletariat , however , was born and has grown under the influence of the success of the Soviet Union &apos;s socialist construction and the threat of war and peril of the imperialists .
Pierce class struggles and national revolutions are unfolding in all capitalist colonial and semi @-@ colonial countries .
The flames of global war and revolution are pressing in on us .
The Chinese Revolution is part of the world revolution .
But the deepening of the national peril , the collapse of the national economy , and the victory of the soviet movement have caused the further development of the Chinese Revolution and pushed it into special prominence in the world revolution .
The core of the current situation in China is the vast Civil War , a life @-@ and @-@ death struggle between revolution and counterrevolution , and the intense confrontation between the political power of the worker @-@ peasant Soviet and the political power of the Kuomintang landlord bourgeoisie .
On the one hand , the Kuomintang landlord bourgeoisie wholly capitulated to imperialism and led imperialism into occupying vast expanses of Chinese territory and monopolizing all of the primary political and economic powers .
And it led the national economy into general collapse , bringing unprecedented suffering to the lives of the hard @-@ working worker @-@ peasant masses .
It stripped all freedom from the revolutionary people , suppressed all revolutionary movements and carried out frenzied , fascist terrorism .
Under the direction of imperialism , it organized all counterrevolutionary forces to launch desperate attacks against the Soviet area and the Red Army .
All these have one objective .
That is to merge the interests of the Chinese landlord bourgeoisie and the interests of capitalism and lead China into becoming a colony .
On the other hand , the Soviet regime called upon all the people of all China for a resolute war of national revolution , organizing and leading the Red Army and the masses in a struggle to defend and expand the Soviet territories .
It sought to smash the repeated &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaigns of the imperialist Kuomintang with determined attacks , and mount a strict guard against the counterrevolutionary attempts of all exploiting elements within the Soviet territories .
All land is to be given to the people and the soldiers of the Red Army .
The workers are to be placed on an 8 @-@ hour work day system , wages are to be increased and aid is to be given to the unemployed .
The social insurance system is to be implemented .
All the people are to have complete freedom of assembly , speech , publication and strike .
The broad masses of workers and peasants are to participate in the administration of their own government organizations , but no element of the exploiting class is to take part .
The economic life of the people is to be organized so as to bring about a change from the former situation , under the rule of the landlord bourgeoisie , of suffering cold and hunger , to a position that is not only wholly free of hunger and cold , but is also improving with every passing day .
The broad masses of people who had no possibility whatsoever to enjoy education under the rule of the landlord bourgeoisie are to gain to a position where their cultural level is heightened daily .
There is only one objectiveto overthrow the rule of the landlord bourgeoisie throughout the country , drive imperialism out of China , liberate several hundred million people from oppression and exploitation under the role of the imperialist Kuomintang , obstruct the path of colonization that will doom China and establish a Soviet China that is free and independent , with territorial integrity .
The daily mounting intensity of the opposition between two political powers cannot but help stimulate the daily intensification of the life @-@ and @-@ death struggle between these two powers .
The current period is the historic
period deciding the victory or defeat of the struggle between the two sides .
Following on the heels of the fourth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; which was smashed , the counterrevolutionaries &apos; fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; is now advancing against us on a massive scale .
The historic task of the Soviet Government is to call upon , organize and lead all revolutionary people throughout the Soviet areas and in all China to take part in this great and decisive battle , mobilize the broad masses of workers and peasants to join the Red Army .
.We must improve the political education and military techniques of the Red Army , enlarge the local armed forces and the guerrilla units , launch guerrilla warfare on a broad scale and strengthen the centralized and unified leadership of the Soviet over the Red Army in the various Soviet areas .
The speed and quality of work carried out by the Soviet will improve .
Fiscal and economic organizations of the Soviet are to ensure that the material needs of the revolutionary war will be met .
We will launch a workers1 class struggle , organize a revolutionary activism of the worker masses and bring it to bear on the struggle to smash the enemy .
The peasants &apos; land struggle will unfold and we will organize the broad masses of peasants to struggle to seize land and protect it .
We call on the toiling masses of workers and peasants in all China to sacrifice everything and exert all efforts for the war .
By so doing we shall thoroughly smash the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; of the imperialist Kuomintang , prevent China from becoming a colony , and win victory , first , for the Soviet , in one or several provinces , and then within the entire nation .
The Imperialist &apos;s Offensive and the Soviet Government &apos;s Leadership of the Anti @-@ Imperialist Campaign
In the 2 years since the Provincial Central Government was established , the most momentous event in the country was the attack of imperialism and the counterrevolutionaries &apos; fourth and fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaigns launched against the revolution .
In the bandit war of Japanese imperialism which began on 18 September 1931 , the eastern provinces of Heilungkiang , Kirin and Liaoning and Jehol Province were occupied under the butchery carried out with planes and artillery .
The P &apos;ing @-@ Tsin area fell under its control , and preparations are now underway for an even more massive and murderous war against Inner Mongolia and all of North China .
The British imperialists attacked Szechwan from Tibet .
The French imperialists attacked Yunnan and Kweichow provinces .
U.S.
imperialism wanted the Yangtze River basin and Fukien Province to be placed under its direct rule .
All these imperialists extended their poisonous hands and schemes over the vast territory of China in order to enslave China , wipe out the Chinese Soviet regime , prepare for the offensive against the Soviet Union and , at the same time , prepare for World War II among the imperialist bandits .
But the landlord bourgeoisie Kuomintang , under a policy of giving everything to imperialism , gave away several million square li of territory , adopted the shameful policy of non @-@ resistance against the attacks of the imperialists .
They bargained the interests of the Chinese working people for political and military assistance from imperialism so as to facilitate the concentration of Its forces to attack the Soviet and the Red Army .
Under such an unprecedentedly grave national crisis , the anti @-@ imperialist movement of the revolutionary people throughout China unfolded in an extremely fierce manner .
The struggle of volunteer forces , several hundred thousand strong , in the Three Eastern Provinces and the bloody battle of Shanghai fought by the soldiers of the 19th Route Army caused the anti @-@ imperialist movement to spread throughout China and surged to unprecedented levels .
At this time the revolutionary people of China were faced with actions of a contradictory nature from two political powers .
The Kuomintang completely capitulated to the imperialists and suppressed , in every way possible , the people opposing imperialism .
The Soviet resolutely opposed imperialism , and in every conceivable way tried to give help to and lead the anti @-@ imperialist movement .
In the past 2 years the Provisional Soviet Central Government has repeatedly cabled its opposition to Japanese imperialism &apos;s war of banditry and of the Kuomintang &apos;s capitulation and betrayal of the nation .
On 14 April 1932 , the Provisional Central Government officially declared war on Japan .
Simultaneously , it issued the mobilization order for war agaisnt Japan , and called upon the people of all China to launch a national revolutionary war and keep the imperialists from enslaving China and oppose the Kuomintang which is betraying China .
The Provisional Central Government and the Revolutionary Military Committee previously called upon all Kuomintang units attacking the Soviet and the Red Army , making it known that they were willing to conclude a fighting agreement to oppose Japan and all imperialism under three conditions .
These were 1 ) immediately cease attacks on the Soviet area ; 2 ) guarantee the democratic rights of the people ( freedom of speech , publication , assembly and association and strike ) ; and 3 ) arm the people and organize an anti @-@ Japanese volunteer army .
When the Kuomintang concluded the Tangku agreement with Japan and when it held the recent direct Sino @-@ Japanese negotiations , the Provisional Government repeatedly proclaimed to the nation , and to the world , its opposition to such policies and actions , which betray the national interests .
The Soviet gives aid to the people &apos;s struggle against Japan in various areas .
The anti @-@ Japanese strike of the Hu Hsi Factory of Shanghai alone was given 16,000 yuan in aid by the Soviet .
Also , there was the soliciting of funds by the people in the Soviet area to help the anti @-@ Japanese North China volunteer army , and much other aid in material and moral support were also given to other anti @-@ imperialist struggles .
In the Soviet territories the special rights of imperialism were completely abolished long ago .
The influence of imperialism was wiped away .
The preachers and priests were driven out by the people .
The people &apos;s property occupied by the missions has been recovered and mission schools have been abolished .
In China it is only the Soviet territories which have shaken off the rule of imperialism .
All these facts clearly indicate that the Soviet Government is the only government that is opposing imperialism .
The Soviet Government should point out to the people of the country that it is the greatest responsibility of the Soviet and the entire people to wage direct warfare against
imperialism and defeat it .
In order to discharge this responsibility , the only way is to rely on the unfolding of the anti @-@ imperialist struggle of the broad masses .
First of all , unite all forces and defeat the Kuomintang , the running dog of imperialism , because it is the biggest obstacle to the opposition put up by the Soviet and the people against imperialism .
The people must understand that precisely because of the Kuomintang * s obstructionspreading across the area between the Soviet territories and the advance of imperialism , and concentrating all its forces on attacks against the Soviet territoriesit is impossible for the Red Army to engage the imperialists in direct warfare .
They have forced the Soviet and the Red Army to take , as their first step , the clearing of the pathway with resolute attacks , to smash the Kuomintang &apos;s &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; The direct and massive conflict between the Soviet and imperialism draws nearer every day .
This makes it necessary for the Soviet to fully strengthen its leadership of all anti @-@ imperialist struggles .
The Soviet should become the organizer and leader of the people &apos;s anti @-@ imperialist struggle throughout the country .
Only by exerting all efforts to make the people understand the current peril and the crimes of the Kuomintang , and depending upon the heightening of the anti @-@ imperialist , anti @-@ Kuomintang consciousness of the broad masses of people and their organizational strength , can the Soviet Government carry out its sacred task to topple the rule of the imperialist Kuomintang in China with national revolutionary and the revolutionary civil war .
The Struggle Between the &quot; Encirclement and Suppression &quot; of the Imperialist Kuomintang and the Anti- &quot; Encirclement and Suppression &quot; of the Soviet Government
Because the Chinese Soviet area is the revolutionary base area of the nationwide anti @-@ imperialist movement , because the Chinese Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army is the main force of the nationwide opposition against imperialism and because the Soviet movement and the revolution are fiercely advancing in their development , the Kuomintang , with the direct assistance of imperialism , concentrated all its forces to launch hopeless attacks against the Soviet and the Red Army one , two , three , four and even five times in an attempt to wipe out the strength of the Chinese revolution and to clear the way for imperialism to carve up China .
But each attack of the imperialist Kuomintang has met with crushing defeat .
With the support of the people throughout the country , and under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party , the Chinese Soviet and the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army have become an invincible force .
Simultaneously , the victories of the Soviet and the Red Army have greatly heightened the enthusiasm of the working people of China .
It has made them realize that only the Soviet and the Red Army are truly fighting for national independence and freedom , and only the Soviet and the Red Army can save China .
The 4th &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; began right after the Kuomintang sold out the Three Eastern ProvincesKirin , Liaoning and Heilungkiang &apos; and concluded the Shanghai cease @-@ fire agreement .
The Kuomintang national traitors did not station even a single soldier to oppose the aggression of Japanese imperialism , and ignored the repeated announcements of the Soviet Central Government and the Red Army stating their willingness to conclude
a combat agreement to fight Japanese imperialism with any troops truly opposing Japan .
On the contrary , the arch criminal of national betrayal in the Kuomintang , Chiang Kai @-@ shek , concentrated several hundred thousand troops to attack Hupeh @-@ Honan @-@ Anhwei and the western Hunan @-@ Hupeh Soviet areas to force the Red Army and to withdraw from the area surrounding Wuhan .
On our side , although there was a need to avoid battle with vastly superior enemy forces , the Red Fourth Front Army was forced to withdraw from the Hupeh @-@ Honan @-@ Anhwei border Soviet area du to our subjective errors in strategy .
It made the famous long inarch and created a new , vast Soviet base in the area along Szechwan , Nan @-@ chiang &#91; 0589 3068 &#93; , Yu @-@ han &#91; 1335 3352 &#93; and Sui @-@ ting &#91; 4840 1353 &#93; .
From the long march of the Red Fourth Front Army came the unfolding of a widespread people &apos;s revolutionary struggle in the distant northwestern area of China , spreading the seeds of the Soviet into an area where the revolutionary situation was relatively backward .
The courage and skill of the Red Fourth Front Army in battle turned more than 10 counties into Red areas in less than a year , induced the hard @-@ working workers and peasants and soldiers of the White army in all of Szechwan Province to lean favorably toward the Soviet revolution .
In spite of themselves , Chiang Kai @-@ shek and the Szechwan warlords were forced into a state of trembling and fear when faced with the great victories of the Red Fourth Front Army .
At the same time , the 2d Red Army Corps , which withdrew from the Hung Hu &#91; 3163 3275 &#93; area , not only did not suffer any appreciable losses , but , in positive actions taken in coordination with the Red Fourth Front Army in the Szechwan @-@ Hupeh @-@ Hunan border Soviet area , won new victories .
As for the area around Hung Hu , guerrilla units were still present there .
In the Hupeh @-@ Honan @-@ Anhwei Soviet area our base not only did not sustain any great losses , but won a consolidated position and has mounted guerrilla warfare on all fronts .
The Central Soviet Area is where the Central Government is located , and it is the homebase of the Soviet movement throughout the country .
It is also the prime target of the enemy &apos;s attack .
The enemy concentrated the greater part of his forces to wage a tenacious campaign against us , deploying the so @-@ called &quot; Central Government Forces the forces of warlords Chiang and Tsai , the warlords of Kwangtung and Kwangsi provinces , and the Hunan warlords to surround the Central Soviet Area and various neighboring Soviet areas from all directions .
After a year of arduous struggle we won an unprecedented victory .
The biggest victory was won in the first half of 1933 .
In this half year period alone , the Red Army of the Central Soviet Area wiped out 24 regiments , 6 battalions and 2 companies of the White Army , smashed 3 divisions , 12 regiments , 5 battalions and 2 companies of the White Army and captured about 20,000 rifles , and some 1,000 machine guns and side arms .
Especially in the Tung Huang Pi &#91; 2639 7806 7095 &#93; campaign , the most tenacious basic column of the enemy was wiped out and a final and most disastrous defeat was inflicted on the enemy &apos;s fourth &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot;
In the great victory of the campaign that smashed the fourth &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; the Red Army not only grew in numbers but also strengthened in quality .
Enormous improvements were attained in the political resoluteness and military techniques of the Red commanders and fighters as compared to the period before the fourth campaign .
The Soviet territory has been
enlarged .
Except for the Soviet area In Szechwan Province , the vast Soviet areas in northwest Fukien Province and east Kiangsi Province have been expanded with an increase in population of nearly 1 million and the new Min Kan &#91; 7044 6373 &#93; Province was established .
The old Soviet areas have become even more consolidated , and this is manifested in the improvement of the functions of the Soviet , the heightening of the revolutionary enthusiasm of the worker @-@ peasant masses , the development of class struggles in the rural and urban areas , as well as the strict suppression of remnant counterrevolutionary forces in the Soviet areas .
Simultaneously , this victory had a great impact upon the Kuotnintang areas .
Under the influence of this victory , the courage to struggle was heightened even further among the worker @-@ peasant masses in the vast White area .
Not only was there general vacillation among the soldiers of the Kuomintang participating in the &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; there was great fear among the cadres , which resulted in forcing Chiang Kai @-@ shek to openly proclaim the desperate order : &quot; Those who do not suppress the bandits but want to fight Japan will be shot without mercy . &quot;
However , the winning of these victories did not happen by chance .
It was dependent upon the correctness of the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s political line , the centralized leadership of the Soviet Government , and the correctness of its plans and policies , the courage and skill of the Red Army in battlet and the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of workers and peasants in the Soviet areas , as well as the daily struggles of the worker @-@ peasant masses of the White areas and the unfolding of the anti @-@ imperialist and anti @-@ Kuomintang movement .
All these fare the basic conditions of defeating the enemy .
Without these conditions there would be no victory .
After its disatrous defeat in the fourth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign , the only way out left for the Kuomintang warlords was to capitulate to imperialism in an even more shameless manner .
It obtained large loans and huge quantities of armaments from imperialism and hired foreign advisors in large numbers .
It assembled the forces it formerly had and organized new forces ( such as training new soldiers , training new units and training the blue shirt society of the officers corps ) .
They concentrated all counterrevolutionary forces and , under the direction of imperialism , launched the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; against the Soviet and the Red Army .
The Soviet , with regard to the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; was completely in accord with what the Party Central Committee had pointed out : &quot; It is a struggle to prevent imperialism from extricating itself from the peril it is in , and it is a struggle to win freedom and independence for Soviet China . &quot; The campaign to smash the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; will decide &quot; whether China will be divided up by imperialism and ruled by it jointly , or wholly become a colony , or whether it will become a new Soviet China , independent , free and with its territory intact . &quot;
The Soviet should call on all the masses in the Soviet and White areas who are participants in the struggle to clearly recognize the gravity of this struggle .
Only by uniting with all revolutionary forces to strengthen our own forces and uniting with great enthusiasm under the leadership of the Soviet , can we achieve complete victory in this campaign ,
The Soviet should give instructions to all the masses participating in the struggle : In smashing this &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; especially after smashing the fourth &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; we have all the basic conditions for defeating the enemy .
The correct leadership of the party and the Soviet , the powerful Red Army and its expansion , the activism in struggle of the broad masses of workers and peasants in the Soviet and White areas- &apos; -all these form the foundation for our victory over the enemy .
Through our efforts and through the development of contradictions inside the ruling class , the new and massive attacks of the imperialist Kuomintang have been dealt a severe blow .
The original plans of the enemy have failed , and they have been forced to launch the final offensive against us under a new plan and on a new front .
We are now face @-@ to @-@ face with the final , decisive battle of the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; Although the blockhouse policy and the policy of economic blockade of the Kuomintang warlords are extremely vicious , they are not impregnable walls of iron and bronze that cannot be overcome .
These policies of the enemy disclose only their own weakness .
We will raise the level of our military techniques and skills , concentrate all our forces and overcome all these difficulties .
Victory belongs to us .
We should point out that the difficulties of the enemy greatly exceed ours .
The vacillation of the White Armies &apos; soldiers , the hate and dissatisfaction of the workers and peasants and the broad masses of petite bourgeoisie under enemy rule , the struggle and division of the various warlord factions in the ruling class , the contradictions and conflicts among the imperialists helping the Kuomintang and the bankruptcy of the Kuomintangrs finances and economyall these are objective conditions of victory for the revolution .
Here we should point out that while the imperialist Kuomintang was carrying out its fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; a people &apos;s government emerged in Fukien Province .
The emergence of this people &apos;s revolutionary government indicates the further disruption of the Kuomintang &apos;s system .
The great victory of the Soviet movement and the KuomintangTs bankruptcy in the eyes of the people throughout the country has forced a part of the reactionary ruling class of China to adopt a new method , , attempting to find a third road outside of the road of the Kuoraintang and the Soviet so as to preserve the lot of the reactionary ruling class , which is near death .
However , this plan is futile , because if an organization such as the People &apos;s Revolutionary Government does not truly proceed from the interests of the hard @-@ working masses of workers and peasants and does not carry out many
basic policies similar to the ones that have been implemented by the Soviet , does not resolutely accept the three conditions already announced by the Soviet Government in April of last year and conclude an agreement with the Soviet Government to oppose imperialism and the Kuomintang and carry it out , it will merely be empty talk and a swindle .
Then , the broad masses of revolutionary people will not see the difference between the Kuomintang and the People &apos;s Revolutionary Government .
It can also be predicted that they will fail tragically .
With the trust and confidence of the people throughout the country in the Soviet growing day by day , and with the daily bankruptcy of the swindles perpetrated by the Kuomintang and all counterrevolutionary factions , the Soviet will resolutely smash the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; obstruct the path of imperialism to turn China into a colony and proceed from victory , first in one or more provinces , to nationwide victory .
These will give proof to that well @-@ known saying : &quot; Only the Soviet can save China ! &quot;
The Formulation of Various Basic Policies of the Soviet in the Past Two Years
When we talk about the various basic policies of the Soviet , we must first ask from what basis do these policies proceed ?
In answering this question , we should understand the past and present situations of the Soviet and the tasks that emerged from these situations .
In the past , the Soviet was born in the midst of guerrilla warfare .
It emerged from various very small places , places which were independent from each other and were not united .
All around each Soviet area was the world of the enemy , and the enemy wreaked destruction and carried out suppression of the Soviet areas every minute of the day .
However , it could defeat all these enemies .
It emerged and developed from the oppression of defeating the enemy countless times .
This was the situation of the Soviet .
There are many differences in the present situation of the Soviet compared to that of the past .
It now has vast territories , a broad mass of people and a powerful Red Army .
It has assembled many dispersed forces ( although they have not all been concentrated ) , and it has organized and become a nationour Chinese Soviet Republic , This nation has its place and central organizations , and it has already established a provisional central government .
This government is a centralized organization of power .
It relies on the broad masses and on the armed forces of the peoplethe Red Army .
It is a government of workers and peasants , it has implemented the revolutionary dictatorship of workers and peasants .
With regard to the workers and peasants it is a broad democracy , but it absolutely does not permit any landlord bourgeois elements to take part in it .
It is a dictatorship , a dictatorship that already has great powers .
This dictatorship is already having a widespread impact within the country , and there is great trust in it among the people .
There Is a great change in the situation from the guerrilla era of the past .
War , nevertheless , is a daily way of life for it and , furthermore , the war has intensified and spread even more .
The reason is because the confrontation between this dictatorship and the dictatorship of the Kuoinintattg landlord bourgeoisie is becoming more acute with each passing day .
It has now entered the decisive period of victory or defeat for both sides , and it is faced with the massive &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; of the imperialist Kuomintang .
This is the current situation of the Soviet .
This kind of situation has decided its tasks , which are that it must exert all of its efforts toward mobilizing , organizing and arming the people .
It must not cease even for a night its attacks on the enemy so as to smash the enemy &apos;s &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; Its task is revolutionary war , the concentration of all its forces to wage revolutionary war , and the use of revolutionary warfare to overthrow the other dictatorship of the enemy .
It must also overthrow the rule of the powerful imperialists , because imperialism is the supporter and leader of that other dictatorship .
The objective of overthrowing imperialism and the Kuomintang is to unify China and carry out a democratic revolution of a bourgeois nature , and , furthermore , it must make it possible for this revolution to be transformed into a socialist revolution in the future .
This is the task of the Soviet .
Can we understand what the purpose of the Soviet is in Implementing various basic policies in such a situation and under such tasks ?
Its purpose is to consolidate the already victorious dictatorship of the workers and peasants , to spread this dictatorship throughout the nation , and to mobilize , organize and arm the hard @-@ working worker @-@ peasant masses throughout the Soviet areas and in all China to overthrow the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang , so as to consolidate and develop this dictatorship .
The Soviet , moreover , must implement various necessary and basic policies in preparation for the future transformation of the current worker @-@ peasant dictatorship of a bourgeois nature into a socialist proletarian dictatorship .
This is the point of departure for all Soviet policies .
The Central Executive Committee and the People &apos;s Committee , holding to the instructions of the First All @-@ Soviet Congress , have adhered resolutely to this kind of general line in policy during the past 2 years and attained immense achievements .
From experience it has proved to all of the revolutionary people in China that only the Soviet Government &apos;s policy is a policy in the interests of the people and for the people &apos;s political power , a policy of resolute opposition against the counterrevolutionary policies of imperialist Kuomintang for toppling the rule of the imperialist Kuomintang throughtout the country , and for rescuing the nation from doom and liberating all hard @-@ working people from oppression .
Heedless to say , in the China where two regimes are in acute opposition , each and every one of the concrete policies of the Soviet must immediately win the support of the broad masses of people .
To the people who have drunk the dregs of oppression and exploitation under the counterrevolutionary
policies of the imperialist Kuoraintang , each and every one of the concrete policies of the Soviet is like a magnet attracting iron filings .
This kind of situation has caused great alarm in the reactionary ruling class .
It did not hesitate to use the most shameless sort of rumor @-@ mongering to slander the policies of the Soviet .
However , ironclad facts powerfully refuted the shameless rumors .
Provided he is not a fanatical Kuomintang landlord capitalist , every Chinese who has eyes will have to admit that there is a vast difference between the policies of the Soviet Government and that of the Kuomintang Government .
Let Us First Talk About the Soviet Arming of the People and the Building of the Red Army
For the purpose of opposing the enemy &apos;s &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; and waging the revolutionary war , the first task of the Soviet is to arm the people , organize a powerful Red Army , local troops and guerrilla units and organize supply and transport for waging war .
In the resolute struggle against the enemy &apos;s fourth and fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression11 campaigns during the past 2 years , the Soviet forces have achieved great success .
First of all , the establishment of the Central Revolutionary Military Affairs Committee unified the leadership of the Red Army throughout the country .
It brought about the beginning of mutual help and coordination of the Red Army units on the various fronts of the various Soviet areas under a unified strategic purpose .
This is the key to the transformation from activities of dispersed guerrilla units to activities of a regular and massive Red Army .
In the past 2 years , the Revolutionary Military Affairs Committee , leading the Red Army throughout the country , primarily the Red Army in the Central Soviet Area , conducted a glorious and victorious war , smashing the fourth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; of the enemy and also winning the initial victory in the campaign against the enemy &apos;s fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot;
In 2 years the Red Army expanded very rapidly , growing several times larger than it was 2 years ago .
The success achieved in this respect was dependent upon the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and peasants for participating in the revolutionary war .
It was also dependent upon the improvement of mobilization methods and the implementation , of the Soviet law and decrees on preferential treatment of Red Army members .
In the month of Red May , 1933 , there was an increase of nearly 20,000 new fighters in the several counties of the Central Soviet Area .
In many areas , masses of workers and peasants rushed into the Red Army as a surging tide .
The opportunist contention of the impossibility of enlarging the Red Army in the new and border areas or that the masses were unwilling to enlist In the Red Array were proven wrong in practice .
The key to the rapid accomplishment of the mobilization plan lies in the correctness of mobilization methods and the thorough implementation of the Soviet law and decrees on preferential treatment of Red Army members .
Abolishing coercive orders , carrying out ample propaganda and persuasion and placing restraints on class alien elements sabotaging the expansion of the Red Army and giving leadership to deserters were important program items of the mobilization methods .
It is necessary to raise the social status of Red Army fighters
to a higher standard , giving all possible and necessary spiritual and material support to each individual Red Army fighter .
We will distribute land to Red Army fighters of non @-@ native residence and mobilize the masses to farm the land for them and to cultivate the land well for the family of each individual Red Army fighter .
There is a 5 @-@ percent discount for families of Red Army members at the consumer cooperatives and we run special shops supplying daily necessities to them , giving 10 percent of the profits made by state enterprises and cooperatives to the families of Red Army members .
We call on the masses to raise funds and aid families of Red Army members afflicted with sickness and to give moral and material comfort to the families of Red Army members .
These practical and thorough implementations of the laws and decrees on the preferential treatment of Red Army fighters and their families are necessary and very important measures ensuring that the Red Army members will proceed to the front without worry and that their will to fight will be consolidated .
A great many models of such work , exist in the various Soviet areas .
The broad masses of workers and peasants in these areas regard as their sacred trust to protect and expand the Soviet areas with guns in their hands , and they march to the fronts in large numbers .
Among these , for example , is Chang @-@ kang &#91; 7022 1481 &#93; Village in Kiangsi Province .
Of the 407 youths and adults between the ages of 16 to 45 , 320 left the village to join the Red Army or work for it .
The ratio &apos; .of those who left the village and those who remained , 87 persons , was 80 percent to 20 percent .
Of the total number of 554 youths and adults of Upper @-@ tsai @-@ chi &#91; 0006 2088 3305 &#93; Village in Fukien Province , only 67 remained .
The comparative ratio between those who left and those who stayed behind was 88 percent to 12 percent .
What about the production of the village and the livelihood of families when such large numbers of able @-@ bodied persons so heroically and courageously took to the fronts ?
Not only was there no adverse effect , but there was even greater expansion and improvement .
What was the reason for this ?
Because of the mutual @-@ help cooperatives , cultivation units and all other methods used have gone about in an organized and planned way to arrange the distribution of the labor force in the village and resolved every one of the difficulties of the families of Red Army members .
I think such glorious lessons are worthy of study by all the Soviet areas .
The transformation of the Red Army into an iron @-@ like consolidated body should be closely linked with its expansion .
Similarly , good results have been achieved on such work in the past 2 years .
The present Red Army has stepped onto the road of becoming a regular , revolutionary armed column of steel .
This is demonstrated by : 1 ) increase in ( class ) elements , putting into practice ( the principle of ) only the hard @-@ working masses of workers and peasants have the glorious right to bear arms and resolutely driving out those class alien elements who have infiltrated ( into the ranks ) ; 2 ) worker cadres have increased and the system of political committee members has been established on a general scale , and the command of the Red Army is held in reliable hands ; 3 ) political work has improved , firming up the determination of Red fighters to struggle to the end for the Soviet , heightened the discipline of class consciousness and the liaison between
the Red Army and the broad masses of people has become closely linked ; A ) military techniques have been improved .
Although the Red Army at present lacks the adoption of the most modern weapons and the training in their use , there have been great improvements in general military techniques in comparison with the past , and 5 ) changes have been made in organizational structure , strengthening the Red Army organizationally .
All these have greatly increased the combat effectiveness of the Red Army , transforming it into an invincible Soviet armed force .
The expansion of Red Youth Units and guerrilla units on a large scale is an extremely important enterprise of the Soviet in the arming of the people to wage revolutionary war .
The Red Guard Army and the Young Pioneers are existing reserve forces in the rear area of the Red Army on the front lines .
These are the local forces for defending the Soviet areas , and they are also the bridge spanning the present voluntary enlistment system to the obligatory service that will be implemented in the future .
As for the guerrilla units , they are the creators of new ( Soviet ) areas and an indis @-@ pensible detachment of the Red Army main force .
In the past 2 years , these units have been developed in the various Soviet areas and their military and political training have also been considerably strengthened .
Their participation in the Red Army , the defense of local areas , attacks on and creating havoc among the enemy , have been clearly demonstrated in the many smashings of the &quot; encirclement and suppressions &quot; to have achieved extremely great results .
These have caused the enemy to fear and wonder and they have become the greatest difficulty facing the enemy1s aggression of the Soviet areas .
Their functions were specially demonstrated in the Central Soviet Areas and the Fukien @-@ Chekiang @-@ Kiangsi Soviet area .
It is an important responsibility of the Soviet to spread this system to all newly opened Soviet areas , vigorously strengthening their training so as to transform these troops into the most reliable brothers of the Red Army in the revolutionary war .
The fleshing out of the Red Army &apos;s rations and supplies , organizing military transportation to maintain liaison between the front lines and the rear lines , and organizing military hygiene and medical treatment are enterprises all of which have similar decisive significance to the revolutionary war ( efforts ) .
Under the situation of economic blockade by the enemy and where we have not yet captured some central cities , the implementation of this task is extremely difficult .
But in the past 2 years , we have been able to establish a considerable foundation in this work by relying upon and drawing from the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and peasants in the Soviet and White areas .
In this respect we had ensured the supply and transportation of rations to the Red Army over extended periods of time .
This , we are forced to admit , is an extremely great achievement .
However , in the current decisive campaign to smash the enemy &apos;s fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; and in the even more massive war to follow , we are required to use our greatest power to strengthen the forces in this respect and ensure that there is an even more adequate supply .
We are faced with a revolutionary war on an even more massive scale , and the Soviet policy of arming the people demonstrates its top priority nature .
Without slackening the arming of the people for even a moment , we must realize the formation of a million strong iron @-@ like Red Army , by carrying out our work with the greatest of speed .
This is the basic fighting task of the Soviet .
The basic task of the Soviet is revolutionary war , the mobilization of all forces of the people to wage war .
Revolving around this basic task are other pressing tasks for the Soviet .
It should carry out extensive democracy for the broad masses of people .
It must resolutely suppress counterrevolution within its ranks .
It must launch the workers &apos; class struggle , unfold the agrarian revolution of the peasants and , under the principle of uniting workers and peasants under the leadership of the working class , heighten the enthusiasm of the worker @-@ peasant masses .
It should carry out correct financial and economic policies so as to ensure the material needs of the revolutionary war .
It should carry out cultural revolution and arm the minds of the workers @-@ peasant masses .
All these , as well as very many other basic policies , are geared to one objective .
That is to topple the imperialist Kuomintang &apos;s rule with revolutionary war , consolidate and develop the democratic dictatorship of the workers and peasants as well as preparing for the transition to the stage of proletarian dictatorship .
Let us now discuss the democratic system of the Soviet .
The Soviet of worker @-@ peasant democratic dictatorship is the people &apos;s own political power , and it is directly dependent upon the people .
It must maintain to the highest degree of intimacy the relationship between itself and the people , and only following that can it play its role .
The Soviet is imbued with mighty powers .
It has already become the organizer and leader of the revolutionary war , as well as organizer and leader of the lives of the masses .
The greatness of its powers cannot be compared with any form of government in history .
It is entirely dependent , however , upon the people and cannot be separated from the people for even a moment .
The Soviet regime must use force in handling all class enemies , but toward its own classthe hard @-@ working masses of workers and peasantsit cannot use force of any kind , and what it demonstrates is only the most extensive form of democracy .
The most extensive democracy of the Soviet is , first of all , displayed in its own election .
The Soviet wholly grants to all exploited and oppressed people all the rights to elect and be elected .
Women have equal rights with men .
For the hard @-@ working workers and peasants , obtaining such rights was a historical precedent .
In summing up the election experiences of the various Soviet areas during the past 2 years , generally speaking , the achievements made were very great .
First , on the registration of voters .
A strict segregation of those residents with voting rights and those without is carried out with the use of Red and White placards .
Amass meeting of voters , which strictly prohibits any exploiting elements from participating , was substituted for the mass meeting held in the past for election purposes ,
Second , the ratio of constituent elements .
In order to ensure the proletariat forming the core of leadership in the Soviet regime the method of electing one representative out of 13 workers and their families and one representative out of 50 peasants and their families was adopted .
These elements were used to organize urban and rural congresses of representatives .
A suitable ratio of worker and peasant representatives was included in all levels of congresses of representatives and executive committees from area governments to the central government .
By so doing , it ensures the alliance of workers and peasants in the organization of the Soviet Government , and places the workers in the position of leadership .
Third , regarding election units .
In order to ensure that the majority of the voters participate in elections , and to enable workers to elect suitable representatives of their own to the Soviet , the new election law proclaimed by the Central Executive Committee in September 1933 provided that each township or city Soviet was to be divided into several election units to carry out elections .
That is , the peasants carry out elections with the village as a unit , while the workers carry out elections with each individual as a unit .
This made the participation of the masses in elections a very convenient matter .
Fourth , on the number of people participating in the election .
The development of the Soviet election campaign has made the voter masses become greatly aware of the relationship between election and their own lives .
Many of those who were not enthusiastic about participating in elections in the past became more active .
In the two elections held in 1932 and in the one held in the latter half of 1933 , more than 80 percent of the electorate participated .
In some places only those who were ill , giving birth or on sentinel duty did not take part in the election meetings .
Fifth , on the candidates &apos; list .
In the election held in the latter half of 1933 , the system of listing candidates was implemented so as to enable the voter to be prepared , before the election , as to whom he should , or should not , vote for .
Sixth , on the candidacy of women .
Currently , in most of the rural and urban Soviets , women candidates elected as representatives account for more than 25 percent .
In some areas such as Upper @-@ tsai @-@ chi Village in Shang Hang , there were 43 women among the 75 representatives , accounting for 60 percent , and there were 59 women among the 91 representatives from Lower @-@ tsai @-@ chi Village , accounting for 66 percent of the total .
The broad masses of working women are now participating in the management of the country .
Seventh , work report .
The village and city Soviets called voters to a meeting before the election .
A report on the work of the Soviet is made to them and they are led to comment on this kind of report .
This method was applied on a more general scale in the election held during the latter hal of 1933 than the one that was held the year before .
All these gave the people a satisfactory method of conducting and managing state organizationsthe election of the Sovietand it ensures the consolidation of the foundation of the Soviet regime .
Next , Soviet democracy can be seen working in the city and village representatives congresses .
The system of urban and rural congresses of representatives is the organizational foundation of the Soviet .
It is the agency through which the Soviet can maintain close liaison with the broad masses of people , and the improvements attained in the past 2 years have made this system even more perfect .
Its most prominent characteristics as follows .
In order to have the representatives of the township and city Soviets maintain a very close relationship with the local residents and facilitate the absorbing of suggestions from the residents , the entire resident population , in accordance with the distance between the residence of the representatives and the local residents , are suitably allocated under the leadership of each representative ( usually 30 to 70 people are placed under the leadership of one representative ) , thereby creating stable relationships between each representative and the people under his leadership .
This , then , enables the people to link up with the Soviet , organizationally , as one .
For township and city soviet representatives , in accordance with how far away he lives , one from among 3 to 7 representatives is elected as chairman of the representatives .
His task is to allocate and guide , under the instruction of the presidiums of township and city Soviets , the work of each representative under his leadership , relay to each representative the notices from the presidium , call meetings of residents under his leadership and resolve comparatively minor matters .
In a village there should be a chairman of representatives with the responsibility to lead the work in the entire village .
There will be a close link between the representatives and the city and township presidium .
And the work In the village will have strong leadership .
Under the township and city Soviets permanent and provisional committees of various types are organized , such as committees for the preferential treatment of Red Army members , committees for water conservancy , education committees , committees for provisions and committees for health .
There can be as many as 10 , and attract large numbers of activists from the people to participate in the work of these committees .
Not only does the township have committees , but the village should also have some committees that are necessary to it .
In doing so , the work of the Soviet is organized into a network , and the broad masses of people are &quot; brought in to participate directly in the work of the Soviet .
Elections of township and city Soviets are scheduled to be held once every 6 months ( half a year for area Soviets and once a year for county and provincial Soviets ) , Thus , it will be easy for new suggestions from the people to reach the Soviets .
Between elections , representatives who have committed grave errors are to be recalled after more than 10 voters petition and more than half of the voters concurred , or they may be expelled after a resolution has been passed by the congress of representatives .
This will prevent bad elements from
maintaining a position in the Soviet organizations for a long period of time .
These are the characteristics of the township and city Soviets which are being implemented in many Soviet areas .
Everybody can see that the development of the democracy of the Soviet political power reaching to such a degree has never before happened in history under any type of political system .
In depending upon this system and closely linking up with the broad masses , the Soviet has become an organization most capable of developing the creativity of the masses and mobilizing the masses to meet the needs of the civil war and revolutionary construction .
This is also something which has not been achieved by any government in history .
The political power organizations of the various levels of the Soviet above the area level are all built on the foundation of the township and city Soviets , and it is organized from the various levels of worker @-@ peasant @-@ soldier representatives congresses and executive committees .
Government functionaries take their appointments to positions through elections , and those who are not trusted are replaced by public opinion .
The discussion and resolution of all problems are up to the people .
Therefore , the Soviet Government is truly the regime of the broad masses .
Besides , the democracy of the Soviet can be seen in the giving of complete freedom of assembly , association , speech , publication and to strike to the revolutionary masses .
At a time when all freedom and rights of the people have been stripped from the revolutionary people In areas under Kuomintang rule , and fascist terrorism is being frantically carried out , each revolutionary citizen under the Soviet Government has the right to freely express his opinion , and the Soviet also provided by all possible means conveniences in material conditions ( such as assembly halls , paper and printing press ) .
The Soviet constantly goes all out to give leadership to all anti @-@ imperialist , anti @-@ Kuomintang assemblies , associations , speech and publications .
What the Soviet does not permit is the counterrevolutionary freedom of those exploiting elements .
The Soviet , furthermore , in order to consolidate the democratic dictatorship of the workers and peasants , must induce the broad masses of people to supervise and criticize its work .
Every revolutionary person has the right to expose the errors and shortcomings of Soviet functionaries .
Corrupt officials of the Kuomintang cover the whole country , and the people of the country only dare to be angry but fear to speak out .
Such a phenomenon is absolutely not allowed under the Soviet system .
If corruption , degeneracy , negativism and feet dragging , as well as bureaucratic elements , are discovered among the Soviet functionaries , the people can immediately expose their errors and the Soviet will immediately punish them .
There will be absolutely no leniency .
This kind of amplitude in the democratic spirit can only exist under the Soviet system .
Finally , the democratic spirit of the Soviet can also be seen in the delimiting of its administrative areas .
The Soviet abolished the former bureaucratic administrative areas which are larger and unweildy .
It has reduced the jurisdictional areas of all levels of the Soviet from provincial to township .
What does this mean ?
It means that the Soviet can keep close contact with the people and , because its jurisdictional area is not big , have general knowledge of what the people want3 very
quickly reflecting the opinions of the people to the Soviet which then quickly discusses and resolve them .
It makes the work of mobilizing the masses for the war and for Soviet construction very convenient .
The Kuomintang warlords &apos; use of the system of large provinces , counties , districts and townships of the feudal era tends only to isolate the people .
The Soviet has no use for it .
We should point out here that the delimiting of villages is a very important program , because , below the township soviet , the most convenient way to carry out the work of the Soviet is to mobilize the people with the village as a unit .
Only by relying on suitable delimiting of villages , establishing of village people &apos;s organizations , and the strong leadership of the village by representatives and chairman of the representatives will the work of the township soviet achieve its greatest affects .
Next , we discuss the Soviet &apos;s attitude toward the landlord bourgeoisie .
The Soviet has realized the most perfect democratic system in the world .
It is open to direct participation by the masses .
It provides the broad masses with all democratic rights , and it absolutely will not , and has no need to , use any kind of force .
However , with regard to the landlord bourgeoisie , that is , the exploiting elements overthrown by the revolutionary people , the Soviet reserves for them a different attitude .
The landlord bourgeoisie , because they are the exploiters and , in the past , were the rulers , hold extremely deep hatred for the Soviet .
Because they have not been wiped out , although they have been overthrown , they still possess a deep @-@ rooted social base , superior knowledge and technology .
Although they have been toppled , they do not cease for a moment to plan a comeback , overthrow the Soviet political power and resume their former system of exploitation .
Especially in this era of Civil War when the enemy is unceasingly carrying out military attacks against the Soviet areas , the overthrown exploiters are even more active in planning , every minute of the day , to respond to the enemy &apos;s attacks with counterrevolutionary activities .
The Soviet regime is forced to take strict punitive and suppressive measures in an all @-@ around manner against these elements .
The first item in the Soviet policy of restraint against these exploiting elements is to keep them outside the regime .
With regard to landlord bourgeoisie and all others who stand in enmity to the revolution , their voting rights have been wholly abolished , and their right to serve in the Red Army and local forces has been voided .
These elements are always resorting to a thousand and one ways to attempt infiltration of Soviet organizations and into the ranks of the Red Army and local forces .
Especially in &apos;the newly opened areas , the mass struggle has not been fully developed , and it is even easier for these elements to utilize opportunities and infiltrate .
Past experiences have demonstrated that the launching of a ruthless and merciless struggle against those elements who have infiltrated into the revolutionary government is , for the Soviet , a task of the most gravest importance .
The second item is the stripping of all freedom of speech , publication , assembly and association from all the landlord bourgeoisie .
This kind of freedom the Soviet gives only to the revolutionary people and not to any elements of the landlord bourgeoisie .
Because these elements of the landlord bourgeoisie will inevitably use this kind of freedom as a tool for their counterrevolutionary campaign , it is absolutely necessary to strip them of it .
Stripping these class enemies of their freedom and lessening the opportunities for them to become active under the pretext of these freedoms is also an important reason why the Soviet is becoming more consolidated daily .
The third item is the use of revolutionary armed forces and revolutionary courts to suppress all counterrevolutionary activities .
Basing itself on the task of arming the people , the Soviet has established a powerful Red Army and widespread local forces .
These form the iron strength on which the Soviet is directly dependent .
Only by relying on them can the Soviet defeat the armed forces of the imperialist Kuomintang , and suppress counterrevolutionary activities within the Soviet areas .
The Soviets also have an important weapon to suppress counterrevolution .
This is the Soviet courts .
The Soviet courts are directly dependent upon the armed forces , the activities of the state &apos;s political defense bureau and the class struggle of the broad masses to enforce strict suppression of all counterrevolutionary attempts in Soviet areas .
In the past several years , serious counterrevolutionary activities have flared up in every one of the Soviet areas , such as the AB group in the central and Hunan @-@ Kiangsi Soviet areas , the social democratic party of Fukien , the reorganization faction of the Hunan @-@ Hupeh @-@ Kwangsi , Hunan @-@ Honan @-@ Anhwei , Fukien @-@ Chekiang @-@ Kiangsi , and Fukien @-@ Kiangsi areas , and the Tuo Chen Chu Hsiao &#91; 2094 7115 0648 3194 &#93; faction of the Hunan @-@ Hupeh @-@ Kiangsi area , all of which have attempted or are even carrying out counterrevolutionary uprising .
But it resulted in all being severely suppressed by the Soviet courts , their plots to stage uprisings were overcome and the Soviet regime was consolidated .
With regard to this matter , the Political Defense Bureau and the Soviet courts have compiled rich experiences and rectified the errors committed in the past of not implementing a clear class line in many areas .
The transformation of Soviet courts into people &apos;s courts , that is , the punishment of counterrevolution , should be linked with the struggle of the broad masses to suppress counterrevolution .
Great improvements have also been made in this respect , of which general use of mobile courts is proof .
From an overall view , the Soviet is equipped with an extremely extensive revolutionary democracy with regard to the broad masses .
Simultaneously , it is within this democracy that its greatest powers are formed , powers erected on the foundation of solid trust and consciousness of tens of millions of worker @-@ peasant masses .
Using these powers , the Soviet formed its own dictatorship , organized the revolutionary war , organized the Soviet courts and launched fierce attacks against the enemy on various fronts .
The Soviet courts thereby played a magnificant role in the suppression of counterrevolutionary activities within the territories of the Soviets .
If a comparison is made &quot; between the courts of the Soviet under the dictatorship of the workers and peasants and the courts of the Kuomintang under the dictatorship of the landlord bourgeoisie , a wonderful picture appears .
The objective of the Soviet courts is the suppression of crimes committed by the landlord bourgeoisie , and sentences meted out are generally light on crimes committed by worker @-@ peasant elements .
The Kuomintang courts have the suppression of the worker @-@ peasant class as their objective and are generally lenient in sentences passed on crimes committed by the landlord bourgeoisie .
The roles of the courts have been completely shaped by their class nature .
On the one hand , the Soivet courts severely suppressed the activities of counterrevolutionary elements , and the Soviet should not display any leniency whatsoever toward such elements .
On the other hand , inhumane treatment of prisoners is prohibited .
The Soviet Central Government has proclaimed an open order abolishing physical punishment .
This is a major reform in history .
But the Kuomintang courts are still full of the inhuman and cruel tortures of the Middle Ages .
Except for capital crimes , the Soviet prisons have adopted a policy of conversion .
They apply the spirit of communism and labor discipline to educate the prisoners and transform their criminal nature .
But the Kuomintang prisons are hells on earth for the working masses and revolutionaries filled with purely feudalistic barbarous killings and fascist tortures .
Wiping out the counterrevolutionary plot of the enemy against the class , establishing the revolutionary order in the Soviet territories , abolishing all barbarous , feudal1vestiges from the sphere of judicial administration is the target of the Soviet courts .
The reforms carried out by the Soviet in this respect similarly have their own historic significance .
The Soviet labor policy is to be discussed next ,
Proceeding from the basis of the class nature in its political power and from its glorious task of arming the working masses to overthrow the imperialist Kuomintang by waging revolutionary war , the Soviet must resolutely promote the workers &apos; class struggle , ensure the daily interests of the workers , develop the revolutionary activism of the workers and organize such activism to bring it to bear on the revolutionary war , as well as transform the workers into active leaders of the revolutionary war and the pillars supporting the consolidation and development of the Soviet .
This is the starting point of the Soviet labor policy .
The interests of the workers is given complete protection under the Soviet labor policy .
The difference is as great as that between paradise and hell when they are compared with the era of Kuomintang rule in the past and the present areas under the Kuomintang .
In the era when the Soviet areas were still under Kuomintang rule , the workers were slaves of their employers .
Work hours were long , wages small , treatment was cruel and there was no legal guarantee of the workers &apos; status .
These are things no worker will ever forget .
In the areas presently under Kuomintang rule all these not only still exist , but have become ever worse .
According to the latest situation the real wages of the workers in the White areas has decreased by more than 50 percent , while decreasing work , laying off workers and closing factories are the usual methods used by the capitalists in their attacks against the workers .
They created mass unemployment , with over 60 percent of the workers of production enterprises unemployed .
In all of , : the areas under Kuomintang rule , strike is a criminal offense , and the Kuomintang openly announced in Hankow in March 1933 that strikers would be sentenced to death .
In all disputes between the workers and the capitalists , the Kuomintang always takes the side of the capitalists to oppress the workers .
Under Soviet political power the workers are masters .
The workers leading the broad masses of peasants have shouldered the glorious responsibility of consolidating and developing the Soviet .
Therefore , the principle underlining the labor policy of the Soviet is the protection of the workers &apos; interests and the consolidation and development of the Soviet regime .
In accordance with this principle the Labor Law was proclaimed in December 1931 .
In 1933 it was revised and reproclaimed .
The revised Labor Law is suitable for application to all urban and rural , big and small enterprises .
The Soviet areas have generally implemented the 8 @-@ hour work system , and have concluded labor contracts and collective labor contracts .
In the cities and in many townships and villages labor inspection , stations with labor inspectors have been generally established to inspect whether employers have broken the Soviet Labor Law .
The punishment of offenses committed by employers is handled by labor courts especially set up for this purpose .
To guard against capitalist manipulation of labor and protect the unemployed workers , the Soviet has monopolized the right to find employment for workers .
All applications for labor submitted by the capitalists must be made at the employment offices set up by the Soviet .
The establishment of agencies to help the unemployed is spreading daily , and unemployed workers are receiving concrete assistance .
Also , workers in the rural areas have been distributed land .
The system of social insurance has been firmly established , and social insurance bureaus have been set up in each of the cities in the Soviet areas .
None of these has ever been available to the workers under the Kuomintang regime , while the Soviet considered the implementation of these policies as its greatest responsibility .
Due to the resolute implementation of the Soviet &apos;s own policies the well @-@ being of the workers in the Soviet areas has been greatly improved ,
First , with regard to labor wages .
The actual wages in the various Soviet areas have generally increased in comparison with pre @-@ revolution period .
The following is an example from Ting @-@ chou &#91; 3060 1558 &#93; .
&#91; See attached table &quot; A. &quot; &#93;
From this table it can be seen that the wages of workers in Ting @-@ chou city have increased at least 32 percent over that of the period before the revolution , and the largest increase ( carpenters ) was 1,450 percent , an increase of 14.5 times textile industry workers .
Such startling increases wholly reflect the shockingly low levels of the Kuomintang era .
Of course , the wages of Ting @-@ chou workers are especially high when compared with other cities and towns ( .the workers meals are also included in the computation ) , but the wages in other towns and cities have also increased .
For example , during the most recent period , the masons and carpenters of Jui @-@ ching &#91; 3843 6855 &#93; township received increases of 80 percent &quot; in wages from the 2 chiao 5 fen daily in the period before the revolution to 4 chiao 5 fen .
Wages have increased not only in towns and cities but also in the rural areas , The following is a comparison table of wages received by workers in miscel ^ -laneous enterprises during different periods in the Tien @-@ chun &#91; 3944 2625 &#93; area of Kan Hsien &#91; 6373 4905 &#93; : &#91; see attached table &quot; B &quot; &#93;
This table represents one rural area .
The wages in other rural areas have generally increased .
With regard to the wages in state @-@ run enterprises , a general increase of 20 percent has been made within the recent 2 years of the various types of enterprises directly under the jurisdiction of the Central Government , with the largest increase registering 40 percent .
Generally speaking , wages are paid on time , and there are very few cases of employers owing wages , due to overseeing by the Soviet .
After being punished by the labor courts , a handful of obdurate capitalists also did not dare to create difficulties for the workers .
The application of the 8 @-@ hour day system to the work period of the courts has become generla during the past 2 years in all of the towns and cities in Soviet areas .
The hours of the hired workers in rural areas are generally less than those for adults .
The protection of women and minors , such as equal work , equal wages , rest before and after birth , prohibition of child labor under 14 , has been fully implemented .
With regard to the protection of apprentices , the age limit has been generally shortened , treatment of apprentices has been improved and the feudal oppression of apprentices swept away .
Considerable improvements have been made in the well being of the apprentices , and their wages have been increased ( for example , apprentices in the Kiangsi area receive at least 15 yuan subsidy annually , and some as large as 3 yuan monthly ) .
As for treatment in general , great improvements have been made in cities , especially in state enterprises , with regard to workers1 meals and hygiene .
The monthly meal allowance for city workers is generally over 6 yuan .
The meals of workers in the rural area are , at least , the same as that of the employers .
The workers in the Soviet area have organized a powerful class trade union .
Such trade unions are the pillars of the Soviet , the bulwark defending the interests of the workers .
At the same time , , they have become schools for the broad masses of workers to study communism .
With regard to the trade unions the Soviet guaranteed their right by law .
There has been a great growth in union membership .
In accordance with the statistics compiled by the All @-@ China General Trade Union , taking into account only the central Soviet area and the nine areas in its vicinity , there are 229,000 members in the trade unions of the Soviet areas , with their distribution as follows ; 110,000 in the central Soviet area , 23,000 in the Hunan @-@ Kiangsi area , 40,000 in the Hunan @-@ Hupeh @-@ Kiangsi area , 25,000 in the Fukien @-@ Chekiang @-@ Kiangsi area , 6,000 in the Fukien @-@ Kiangsi area and 5,000 in the northern Fukien area .
Based on the materials of the central Soviet area , there are only 3,676 persons who have not joined the trade unions , which is less than 5 percent of all the workers .
That is to say , 95 percent of the workers are members .
In some places , such as Hsing @-@ kuo &#91; 5281 0948 &#93; , 98 percent of the workers joined trade unions .
Could this , I ask , be dreamed of in the Kuomintang areas ?
Not only in China , but also the whole world , with the exception of the Soviet Union , which imperialist country enjoys such a situation ?
In brief , the Soviet Labor Law has been implemented in all the towns and cities in the Soviet areas during the past 2 years , and the important articles of the Labor Law have also been implemented in the rural areas .
Although opposition by quite a few capitalists and rich peasants to the Labor Law has been encountered during the 2 years , such opposition came to nought due to the spirited struggle of the worker masses and the strict supervision of the Soviet .
At the same time , cases of transgression of the Labor Law arise from time to time in the hiring of workers by independent producers , middle and poor peas @-@ ants , and these should be handled through sincere remonstrations until they understand and voluntarily support the Labor Law , Therefore , great improvements were made in the well @-@ being of the workers .
This has led to the development of the enthusiasm of workers on a -massive scale , and the workers were able to play a .
glorious role in the revolutionary war and in Soviet construction .
In accordance with the compilations made by the 12 counties of Kung @-@ lueh &#91; 0361 3970 &#93; , Wan @-@ tai &#91; 8001 3141 &#93; , Lung @-@ kang &#91; 7893 1481 &#93; , Hsing @-@ kuo &#91; 5283 0948 &#93; , Hsing ^ li &#91; 0524 0448 &#93; , Hsi @-@ chiang &#91; 6007 3068 &#93; , Yu @-@ tu &#91; 0061 6757 &#93; , Hsun @-@ wu &#91; 1416 0839 &#93; , Shang @-@ hang &#91; 0006 2635 &#93; , Mng @-@ hua &#91; 1337 0553 &#93; , Chang @-@ ting &#91; 7022 3060 &#93; and Hsin-.chuan &#91; 2450 3123 &#93; , in the central Soviet area , the 19,960 union members , out of a total membership of 70,580 , who are serving in the Red Army and in guerrilla units are equivalent to 20 percent of the entire membership .
The 6,752 working in revolutionary Soviet organizations account for 10 percent of the membership , and they are * mostly in responsible positions in the Soviet organizations .
The above two .
items , totaling 26,712 persons , account for 38 percent of the membership .
There are 43,868 members who are still at home .
Second issue bonds valued at 43,855 yuan have been redeemed from the members
remaining at home in these 12 counties .
Recently they bought economic construction bonds valued at 197,803 yuan , averaging out at 4 yuan 5 chiao per person .
Of the trade unions members who remained at home , 12,435 have become members of the Communist Party and the tuan , accounting for 28 percent of the total number of members at home .
These statistics prove that the worker masses are actively participating in the Red Army and they are participating and supporting the revolution , and supporting the Chinese Communist Party .
This resulted from the Soviet &apos;s protection of workers &apos; interests , thereby sparking the enthusiasm of the workers .
Those remarks about workers not having received anything after the revolution began , and that the enthusiasm of the workers has not been developed , can all be written off as pure nonsense .
Let us now discuss the agrarian revolution of the Soviet areas .
The Chinese Soviet and the Red Army emerged and developed in the midst of the agrarian revolution .
Only agrarian revolution could liberate the broad masses of peasants from the ruthless oppression and exploitation of the landlord class and the Kuomintang warlords .
The land policy of the Soviet is based on the principle of completely overthrowing all of the feudal and semi @-@ feudal oppressions and exploitations of the landlord class and the Kuomintang warlords .
Now , as in the past , shocking land rents ( 60 to 80 percent ) , shocking usurious rates ( .30 to 100 percent ) and shockingly exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies ( over 1,700 kinds of taxes and levies throughout the country ) prevail in the rural villages in the Kuomintang areas .
As a result , land was concentrated in the hands of the landlord class and the rich peasants .
The greatest majority of the peasants lost their land and fell into a terrible situation of suffering from which there was no escape .
Because of the ruthless plunder of the land the peasants lost their ability to protect themselves against the disaster of famine .
As a result , the entire country had floods , droughts and famines .
In 1931 , the area struck by disasters covered 809 counties , and over 44 million people were affected by them .
Due to the layer ^ upon @-@ layer of rapacious plunder the peasants lacked the ability to produce again .
Much cultivated land became unfruitful and much just turned into wasteland .
At the same time , the only produce the peasants had was overwhelmed by the imperialist &apos;s dumping of agricultural products .
For this reason the rural economy of China fell into a state of complete bankruptcy .
It was from this basis that the flames of agrarian revolution exploded with powerful force in the rural areas .
The might of the Soviet agrarian revolution swept away all vestiges of feudalism .
Millions and tens of millions of peasants have been jolted into awareness from a long period of darkness , seized all the landed estates of the landlord class , confiscated the lands of the rich peasants , abolished usury and liquidated exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies , overthrew all who stood against the revolution , and established their own political power .
The first time they emerged from hell , the peasant masses became masters .
This is the difference between the rural situation under the Soviet political power and that under the Kuomintang political power .
The First All @-@ Soviet Congress promulgated the Land Law and created a correct basis for the solution of land problems throughout the country .
Because of the intensification of the class struggle in the rural areas many disputes arose from the problem of class analysis .
The people &apos;s committee , in accordance with experiences gained from land struggles of the past , set forth the &quot; resolutions on various problems in land struggle / 1 and correctly resolved many problems such as landlords , rich peasants , middle peasants , poor peasants and vagrants , Struggles in the rural areas will become even stronger .
As with many problems on land distribution such as distance , fertility , green sprouts , forests and ponds , we urgently need to collect the experiences of various areas and make the necessary decisions .
This is imperative in the leadership of land distribution in new areas .
In order that the remnant forces of feudalism are thoroughly eliminated and to enable the fruits of agrarian revolution to fall completely into the hands of tennant farmers , poor peasants and middle peasants , the Central Government has launched a widespread and penetrating movement * of land investigation .
According to the statistics compiled in the 3 months of July , August and September 1933 , a total of 3,980 landlord families and 6,638 rich peasant families was unearthed in the three provinces of Kiangsi , Fukien and Kiangsi @-@ Hupeh in the central Soviet area .
From the hands of these exposed landlords and rich peasants 307,539 tan of land were recovered , and cash from landlords and contributions from rich peasants totaling 606,916 yuan were confiscated .
The revolutionary enthusiasm of the peasant masses developed even further and the tenant farmer trade union and the poor peasants group became the pillars of the Soviet in the rural areas .
Gaining such great results in 3 months proves that the Soviet must still give its full attention to the class struggle in the rural areas , and the land investigation movement being a powerful method to continue the development of struggles in the rural areas for thoroughly wiping out the remnant forces of feudalism has also been wholly proved .
The class line of the land struggle is to rely on tennant farmers and poor peasants , unite with the middle peasants and exploit the rich peasants and wipe out the landlords .
The correct application of this line is the key to guaranteeing the victorious development of the land struggle , and it is the basis of each concrete policy of the Soviet formulated for the rural areas .
The Soviet should place severe restraint on erroneous tendencies toward infringing upon middle peasants Cprimarily toward rich middle peasants ) and elimination of rich peasants .
But , at the same time , there absolutely should not be any slackening toward those errors of seeking compromise with the landlord rich peasants .
Only by opposing such errors can the land struggle be led onto the correct path .
With regard to the work done on the masses with respect to land struggles ?
considerable experiences have Been accumulated during the past 2 years .
In summary , Its principal points are :
In both the movement of land distribution and the land investigation movement , an all @-@ out effort must be made to mobilize the broad masses of poor and middle peasants and the broad masses of workers in the rural areas to struggle personally against landlord rich peasants .
The work of land distribution and land investigation must be carried out with the concurrance of the masses .
The handling of each one of the class elements must be done through meetings of the masses .
There is the danger of decreasing enthusiasm of the masses fur struggle if Soviet personnel , alone or with a handful of others , were to carry out the distribution of land or investigation of class .
When assets of the landlord class , besides land , and surplus plow oxen , farming implements.and buildings are confiscated , the greater part of it must be distributed to the poor people .
If this is not done and they are given over to a handful of people for use , it will also lower the spirits of the masses and will land itself to the opposition of the exploiting elements .
Distribution of land over a long and erratic period of time is not appropriate , It should be completed within a considerably short period of time so that the land will remain firmly in the hands of the peasants .
Later , redistribution of land should not be lightly undertaken in the absence of a request from the majority of the local people .
If we do not adhere to this , we will be going counter to wishes of the peasants .
We would not only adversely affect the attitude of the peasants toward producing from the land , -but would allow exploiting elements to obstruct the progress of the land struggle .
The object of land investigation is to ferret out exploiting elements and not to expose the exploited elements .
Therefore , house @-@ to @-@ house and mou @-@ tO &apos; -mou inspections should be avoided .
What should be done is the mobilization of the greatest number of people to ferret out those landlord and rich peasant elements who are in hiding .
Those counterrevolutionary elements who impeded land distribution and land investigation must be severely dealt with .
With the concurrance of the masses use the most severe method to control them , from the time they were arrested , imprisoned and publicly tried by the masses , right up to the time of their execution .
This is absolutely necessary , because if it is not done in this manner , the land struggle will be greatly impeded .
Class struggle should be developed in an all @-@ out manner , but avoid struggles between localities , between clans and between nationalities .
The landlord class and the rich peasant &apos;s desire wholeheartedly to replace class struggle with this kind of struggle and obstruct the progress of agrarian revolution , and personnel of the Soviet should not be taken In by them .
7 . The progress of agrarian revolution is dependent upon the enhancement
of the level of organization and class consciousness of the basic masses
in the rural areas .
Soviet personnel , therefore , must carry out propaganda
on a wide and intensive scale and make sound the organization of poor
peasant groups and tenant farmers trade unions .
The agrarian revolution not only gets land to the peasants , it must also make the peasants develop the production force of the land and due to the leadership of the Soviet and the enhancement of the peasants &apos; enthusiasm for labor , agricultural production has recovered over a wide area In the Soviet areas .
In some places it has developed even further ,
On this basis the peasants &apos; well--being has been vastly improved .
The peasants overthrew the exploitation of landlords and the Kuomintang and , as a result , production came into their own hands .
The current standard of living of the peasants has been at least doubled , in comparison with that under the Kuomintang .
The majority of the peasants were hungry many times in the past year , and in times of difficulty they had to eat tree bark and grain chaff .
But , generally speaking , there is no more hunger now , and living conditions have improved with each passing year .
In the past , the majority of the peasants had very little meat during the year .
Meat is eaten more frequently now , In the past , the majority of the peasants were clothed in rags .
This is generally @-@ improved now , sometimes by 100 and even 200 percent .
What kind of life and what kind of political power do the peasant masses want ?
Let the peasant masses in all of the Kuomintang areas answer this question themselves !
We then discuss the financial policy of the Soviet .
The object of Soviet finance is to guarantee provisions and supply for the revolution and the disbursement of all other revolutionary expenditures .
The Soviet Republic , required to meet outlays in vast revolution war and revolutionary work expenditures and constituting a small portion of the entire country , which is also an area with a comparatively backward economy , is carrying out a taxation , policy favorable to the broad masses .
Many outsiders do not know where the solution for Soviet finances will come from .
Meanwhile , why did the Kuomintang become bankrupt , with it occupying a vast area and extracting the wealth of the people in vast quantities ?
There is nothing strange about it .
There is a basic difference between the financial policy of the Soviet and its application of funds with that of the Kuomintang .
The Soviet financial policy is founded on the principle of class interests and the interests of the revolution .
The Soviet &apos;s sources for funds are ;
1 ) confiscation or forceful collection from all feudal exploiters ;
2 ) tax revenue ; and 3 ) development of the national economy .
What confiscation or forceful collection from all feudal exploiters means is to make collections from landlords and rich peasants in the Soviet and the White areas .
Based on past experience , this revenue frequently accounts for the lion &apos;s share .
This is exactly opposite to the Kuomintang &apos;s fiscal policy .
The Soviet places the main financial burden on the exploiters , whereas the Kuomintang places it on the hard @-@ working masses of workers and peasants .
The tax collection of the Soviet is a unified excalating tax .
It is currently being carried out in a simple manner on two sides , that is , commerce tax and agricultural tax .
The principle of taxation is similarly placing the burden on the exploiters .
The collection of commercial taxes is divided into custom tax and business tax .
The custom tax is for the purpose of regulating the export and import of commodities in accordance with the degree of need of the Soviet areas .
The rates include complete exemption , and some going as high as 100 percent .
Only the Soviet has implemented a wholly free customs tax system which is not subjected to any interference from foreign countries .
All merchandise goes into circulation all over the Soviet areas after paying taxes at the border customs , and there is no second taxation , thereby sweeping away the Kuomintang &apos;s tyranny of the money barrier and the layers of extortion .
Business tax is sales tax ( industrial tax is not being collected at present ) , In accordance with the size of the businessman &apos;s capital and his profit , a unified , escalated tax is collected .
Tax is light on small capital and small profits , and heavy on big capital and big profits .
Where the capital is below 100 yuan , the people &apos;s cooperatives , and surplus products sold directly by the peasants are all exempted .
The agricultural tax is dependent upon the revolutionary fervor of the peasants as this tax is collected on a voluntary basis , and it is similarly progressive .
Where there are few In the family and land distributed Is small , the tax is light , and.where there are many in the family and land distributed is large , the tax is heavy .
Tax is light on poor and middle peasants , but heavy on rich peasants .
Tenant farmers and families of Red Army members are exempted from taxation , and in disaster areas tax is reduced or exempted in accordance with the lightness or severity of the disaster situation .
The unified , progressive tax system adopted by the Soviet is the best tax system In the world , and it Is a system all capitalist countries dare not adopt or adopt it in its entirety , As for the Kuomintang &apos;s tax collection , it is .
one complete mess .
Its tax policy is primarily to collect from peasants and other petit &quot; bourgeoisie .
Besides the principal tax , there are countless tacked ^ on taxes .
In accordance with the statistics compiled by the TA KHING PAO and published in 22 March 1933 there are as many as 1,756 items of taxations in the Kuomintang areas .
And the land taxes in Szechwan Province have been prer @-@ collected up to 1987 , and the land taxes in Shensi Province have increased 25 times over the period before the arrival of the Kuomintang .
These are the &quot; Benefactions &quot; of the Kuomintang for the hard @-@ working masses !
To increase our revenue by developing the national economy is a basic principle of our financial policy ; it has already brought tangible results In the Fukien @-@ Chekiang ^ Kiangsi border area and is beginning to do so in the central area , too .
It is the duty of our financial and economic
organizations to apply this principle conscientously ..
In this connection , we should make quite sure that the issuing of notes by the state bank is based primarily on the needs of economic development , and only secondarily on purely fiscal needs .
Thrift should be the guiding principle in our government expenditures .
It should be made clear to all government workers that corruption and waste are very great crimes .
Our campaigns against corruption and waste have already achieved some results , but further efforts are required .
Our system of accounting must Be guided by the principle of saving every copper for the war effort , for the revolutionary cause , and for economic construction .
Our method of spending state revenue must be strictly different from those of the Kuomintang .
There are difficulties in the finances of the Soviet .
With the expansion of the Red Army and the development of the revolution , the Soviet does face difficulties in its finances .
Overcoming difficulty is inherent in the difficulty itself .
The method for overcoming the difficulty is to develop our revolution , improve our Soviet work , augment our revenue from all of the Kuomintang areas , place the burden of Soviet finance on the shoulders of all exploiting elements and increase the revenue of the Soviet through the development of the national economy .
We will discuss Soviet economic policy . _ _ _ _
Only the shameless Kuomintang warlords will create rumors every day about the utter devastation of the Soviet region when the people are impoverished and the finances exhausted in the area under their control .
The goal of the imperialist Kuomintang is to sabotage the Soviet region , the advancing Soviet construction , and the welfare of the tens of millions of liberated worker @-@ peasant masses ; therefore , the counterrevolutionaries have not only organized all their military strength for &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; but also enforced a ruthless policy of blockade in the economic aspect .
Nevertheless , the broad masses and the Red Army led by the Soviet government have not only routed the enemy &quot; encirclement &quot; time and again , but also undertaken all possible and necessary economic constructions to break down the vicious enemy blockade .
Currently , this measure taken by the Soviet is successful step by step .
As the central task of the Soviet is to strive for victory in the war against the imperialist Kuomintang , while the current Soviet region is situated in areas relatively backward in economy and hemmed in by enemy blockade , the principle of the Soviet economic policy is to undertake all possible and necessary constructions in the economic aspect and concentrate strengths to supply the war .
Meanwhile , the Soviet is doing its utmost to improve the people &apos;s living , consolidate the worker @-@ peasant alliance in the economic aspect , assure the proletariat &apos;s leadership of the peasants , and create the premise and superiority for the development of the socialist construction in the future .
The nucleus of the SovietTs economic construction is to develop agricultural production , industrial production , export trade and the cooperative movement .
Currently , the agriculture of the Soviet region is obviously making progress .
The 1933 farm output of the Central Soviet region increased 15 percent compared to that of 1932 , while that of the Fukien @-@ Chekiang @-@ Kiangsi Soviet region grew 20 percent .
In the first or second year after the uprising , the agricultural output of Soviet areas often appeared to be dropping .
However , with the decision to divide the land , the promotion effort of the Soviet , and the growing labor enthusiasm of the peasant masses , production recovered .
Currently some areas have not only recovered , but also surpassed the level before the uprising .
Other areas have not only eliminated the land laid waste in the course of the uprising , but also reclaimed new land .
Many areas have organized labor cooperatives and farming teams to relieve the rural labor force .
They have organized plow oxen cooperatives to solve the shortage of plow animals .
Meanwhile , the broad masses of women have joined the emergency work on the production front .
All these would have been absolutely impossible in the Kuomintang era .
In the Kuomintang era , land was the private property of the landowners , and the peasants were neither willing nor able to improve the land with their own effort .
Only after the land distribution to the peasants by the Soviet and the Soviet &apos;s promotion and encouragement was the labor enthusiasm of the peasant masses stimulated , leading to great production victories .
Here it must be pointed out that , under the current condition , agricultural production takes the first place in the Soviet economic construction .
Agricultural production will not only solve the most important grain issue , but also shoulder the responsibility of supplying the raw material ( cotton , hemp , sugarcane , bamboo , etc . ) for such everyday necessities as clothes , sugar and paper .
In addition , afforestation and livestock production are also important parts of agriculture .
It is both permissible and necessary to formulate appropriate production plans on the foundation of the small @-@ peasant economy and mobilize the peasants to fulfill the plans ( for example , so many 10 , OOQ ^ catties of cotton per province ) .
The Soviet must pay further attention and devote a greater effort in this aspect .
In regard to the many basic conditions of agricultural production , such as manpower , plow oxen , raw material , seeds and water conservation , the Soviet must vigorously guide the peasants toward their solution .
Here , organizing the manpower to relieve the shortage and activating the women to participate in production constitute the most fundamental issue of agricultural production in the Soviet region .
Meanwhile , organizing labor cooperatives and farming teams and mobilizing and encouraging the entire rural masses during the crucial spring and summer seasons are the effective means to solve the issue .
The lack of plow oxen by a large portion of the peasants ( about 25 percent ) is also a very big problem .
Organizing plow oxen cooperatives and mobilizing all households without plow animals to buy the animals together and share in their use are matters which the Soviet must give attention to .
Water conservation Is the lifeline of agriculture , and the Soviet must give serious attention to it .
Naturally , this is not yet the time to bring up the problems of soviet and collective agriculture .
However , for the purpose of promoting agriculture , organizing a soviet experimental farm on a small scale in every village and ward and establishing agricultural study schools and farm products exhibition sites are urgently needed .
Enemy blockade has made our export difficult .
Many handicraft enterprises in the Soviet region have deteriorated , especially tobacco and paper .
However , it is not absolutely impossible to overcome such export difficulties .
Furthermore , in view of the need of the broad masses in the Soviet region , we possess our own extensive market .
We must systematically develop our industry for export , but mainly for self @-@ sufficiency .
In the past 2 years , especially since the first half of 1933 , as the Soviet has begun to pay attention and as the mass production cooperatives have gradually developed , many industries have started to recover .
Here the main items are tobacco , paper , tungsten , camphor , farm tools and fertilizer ( such as lime ) , while textile , drug manufacturing and sugar refining are also not to be overlooked in the present environment .
In the Fukien @-@ Chekiang @-@ Kiangsi region , some of the areas did not have much industry to start with , such as paper making , textile weaving and sugar refining , but now such industries have actually been started and are producing good results .
To relieve the shortage of salt , they have undertaken the manufacture of nitrate .
In regard to industry , it is even more necessary to have suitable planning .
Naturally , it is impossible to formulate general and precise plans on the foundation of the scattered handicraft industries , but , in regard to certain minor industries , primarily the enterprises operated by the state and the cooperatives , it is entirely necessary to formulate appropriate precise production plans .
The accurate estimate of raw material production and the assessment of the market in the White and Soviet regions are matters requiring the attention of Soviet and cooperative industries right from the beginning .
Planned organizing of foreign trade and direct handling of the circulation of certain necessary commodities , such as the import of salt and fabric , the export of grain and tungsten , and grain circulation inside the Soviet region , are currently extremely crucial .
Such work was begun relatively early in the Fukien @-@ Chekiang @-@ Kiangsi region , while the Central region started in the spring of 1933 .
With the establishment of such agencies as the Foreign Trade Bureau , preliminary achievements have been made .
Currently , the national economy of the Soviet region is developed in three simultaneous aspectsstate operated , cooperative and private enterprises .
Now limited to the feasible and essential , the state operated economy has been started in both industry and commerce .
Its future is naturally inestimable .
As for private economy , as long as it stays within the limits of the law , the Soviet not only will not block it , but will promote and encourage it , because the development of private economy at the present time is required by the interest of the Soviet .
Needless to say , private economy occupies a position of absolute predominance at the present time , and such predominance will remain for a considerably long period of time to come .
The development of private economy in the Soviet region generally follows the pattern of small capital .
The cooperative economy is developing rapidly .
According to the September 1933 statistics of 17 counties in Kiangsi and Fukien provinces , all types of cooperatives totaled 1,423 , with the shares amounting to 305,551 yuan .
Due to the promotion by the Economic Construction Mass Meeting , the development of such counties as Jui @-@ chin and Hsing @-@ kuo in a little over a month after the meeting surpassed the figures for the entire period before it .
Currently , the large @-@ scale development of cooperatives covers mainly consumer and grain cooperatives , with production cooperatives second .
As for the credit cooperative , it is still just beginning .
The development of the cooperative movement will doubtlessly become the pivot of the economic development of the Soviet region .
The cooperative economy and the state operated economy , when coordinated , will become a tremendous force in the economic aspect .
In the long process of the struggle against the private economy , they will gradually gain the leading and superior position and form the condition for the economy of the Soviet region , to develop to a socialist economy .
Therefore , developing state enterprises as much as possible and promoting cooperatives on a large scale must be pursued simultaneously with the encouragement of private economy ,
For the purpose of developing state operated enterprises and aiding the cooperative movement , the People &apos;s Committee , with the support of the masses , issued 3 million yuan of economic construction bonds .
Solving the economic construction capital problem by relying on the strength of the masses is the only feasible means at present .
While all of China is engulfed in an economic calamity and the hundreds of millions of people are hungry and cold , the Soviet government , in disregard of all difficulties , conscientiously pursues economic construction for the revolutionary war and in the interest of the people .
Very obviously , only the victory of the Soviet over the imperialist Kuomintang and only its planned and organized economic construction will rescue the hundreds of millions of the nation from the unprecedented economic calamity .
&#91; Footnotes &#93; Increasing our revenue by developing the national economy is our basic financial policy , The apparent effect has been demonstrated in the Fukien @-@ Chekiang @-@ Kiangsi Border Area and has begun to be demonstrated in the Central Region .
The enforcement of this policy is the responsibility of our fiscal and economic organs .
Here , attention tnus @-@ t be given to the fact that the issuance of paper currency by state banks must be based on the need of the development of the national economy , and simply fiscal need can only take second place .
Fiscal disbursement must follow the policy of thrift .
All government work personnel must understand that corruption and waste are serious crimes .
Some achievement was made in the struggle against corruption and waste in the past , and we must continue with our effort hereafter .
Saving every penny for the war and the revolutionary cause , and for our economic construction , is the principle of our accounting system .
A strict distinction must be made between the way we spend our state revenue and the way of the Kuomintang .
We will now- deal with Soviet cultural education .
Reform of cultural education must be carried out by the Soviet in order to win victory in the revolution , consolidate and develop the Soviet regime , mobilise all the forces of the people for the purpose of waging the great revolutionary struggle , create a new and revolutionary generation and free the worker ~ peasant masses from the spiritual shackles placed upon them by the reactionary ruling class , We must create a new , Soviet culture of workers and peasants .
It is public knowledge that all educational and cultural agencies under the Kuomintang rule are in the hands of the landlord bourgeoisie .
Their policy is to carry out lopsided propaganda to eradicate revolutionary concepts of the oppressed class , on the one hand , and implement a policy of hoodwinking the people so as to exclude workers and peasants from education on the other , Educational funds were used by the reactionary Kuomintang to finance attacks on the revolution , most schools stopped operating and a majority of the students were idled .
The people became ignorant and foolish under the rule of the &apos;Kuomintang and over 80 percent of the entire population was illiterate .
While extremely vicious White terrorism was adopted against revolutionary concepts , all left @-@ wing literary figures and sociologists and revolutionaries in cultural and educational agencies were subjected to the ravages of the Kuomintang fascist emperor , turning all educational organizations into dark , hell @-@ boles .
This is the Kuomintang ! s educational policy .
Whoever comes to our Soviet area , and takes a look will see immedlately that it is a free and bright new country ,
All educational agencies are in the hands of the laboring masses of workers and peasants .
The workers and peasants and their children enjoy priority rights to education .
The Soviet Government is using all possible methods to raise the cultural level of workers and peasants , and for the purpose of attaining this objective all possible political and material aid are given to the masses .
For this reason , Soviet areas are today speeding up the revolutionary cultural construction , although they are situated in an environment of ruthless Civil War and were , in the past , culturally very backward areas .
According to the compilations of the three provinces of Kiangsi , Fukien and Hupeh &apos; -Kiangsi , there are 3,05.2 Lenin elementary schools , with 89,710 students , 6,462 supplementary night schools with 94,517 students , 32,388 adult education groups ( this does not include figures from Fukien ) with 155,371 members and 1,656 clubs with 49,668 functionaries .
This is only a partial compilation of the central Soviet areas .
The majority of school age children are in Lenin elementary schools in many of the Soviet areas .
For example , 12,806 C8,825 boys and 3,981 girls ) out of 20,969 ( 12,076 boys and 8,893 girls ) school age children in Hsing @-@ kuo &#91; 5281 0948 &#93; are attending Lenin elementary schools , and 8,163 ( 3,251 boys and 4,912 girls ) are idle .
The comparative ratios for those attending schools and those who do not is 6 to 4 .
Children in many places in the Soviet areas are most of the time engaged in receiving education and in play , and only a small part of their time is applied to home chores .
This is exactly opposite to the situation prevailing during the Kuomintang period .
The children are , at the same time , enrolled in the Red Children Group * These groups are similar to schools for the children to learn about communism .
Such enthusiastic demands of women for education have never before been seen .
Of the 15 ? 740 students attending supplementary night schools in Hsing @-@ kuo , 4 ? 986 are males , accounting for 31 percent of the total and 10,752 are females , accounting for 69 percent .
Of the 22,519 members of the adult education groups , 9,000 are males , accounting for 40 percent , and 13,519 are females , accounting for 60 percent of the total .
Illiterate women in Hsing @-@ kuo and other areas have achieved initial liberation and are enthusiastic about activities .
Women are not only receiving education but also presiding over it .
Many women have become principals of elementary and night schools and members of educational committees and literary committees .
Associations of women workers and peasants have become common in the Soviet areas .
The focus is on the entire interests of women workers , and , of course , the education of women is also a part of it .
The literacy of the masses has grown rapidly .
Night schools , literacy movements and placards are used to induce literacy .
Night schools are set in location , literacy groups are located in the homes of the masses and .
literacy placards are mounted along the roads .
The literacy -movement is led by a village committee .
H &apos;sing @-@ kuo is an example , There is a general committee for the literacy -movement in more than 130 villages , 3,387 branch
committees for 561 villages and there are members enrolled in the 12 ? 529 literacy groups below the branch committees .
This is a , mass movement on an extremely vast scale to sweep away illiteracy and it should be expanded to cover all rural and urban areas in the Soviet territories .
We can also see from the publications of newspapers the rapid advances being made in the cultural movement in the Soviet areas .
There are 34 different kinds of big and small newspapers in the central Soviet areas , of which RED CHINA has increased its printing from 3,000 to 4,000 copies . , THE TRUTH FROM YOUTH prints 28,000 copies , STRUGGLE 27,100 copies and RED STAR 17,300 copies .
All these prove that the cultural level of the masses is being rapidly elevated ,
The revolutionary arts of the masses in the Soviet areas are beginning to be formed .
The theatre of the workers and peasants , the blue shirt group and the club movement in the rural areas are expanding widely .
The Red physical culture movement of the -masses is also developing rapidly .
Track events are available even in isolated rural hamlets and villages and sports grounds have been established in many areas .
Soviet areas are still lacking in the construction of complete specialized education apparatus , although we have established the Red Army University , the Soviet University , the Marxist Communist University and many schools for educating cadres under the leadership of the department of education for the training of leading cadres in the revolutionary struggle .
Beyond doubt , limiting the expansion of general education for the development of secondary and special ( vocational ) education should be matfe part of the educational plans .
The forming of worker &lt; -peasant intellectuals , developing cultural education and utilizing intellectuals with landlord bourgeois background to serve the Soviet should not be neglected in the Soviet &apos;s cultural policy .
Where does the general guideline of the Soviet cultural education lie ?
It lies in the education of the broad masses of laboring people with the communist spirit ?
using cultural education to serve the revolution and the class struggle , and linking up education arid labor .
What are the central tasks of the Soviet &apos;s cultural construction ?
They are the implementation of obligatory education in full , developing and spreading social education and developing large numbers of high ranking cadres to lead the revolution .
Everyone should understand that all these policies and tasks can be implemented only under the Soviet political power , because it is a manifestation of the intensification of class struggle .
This is an absolutely great victory in the spiritual liberation of humankind .
We shall now discuss the -marriage system of the Soviet .
The Central Executive Committee promulgated the Soviet marriage laws in November 1931 , in order to liberate women from the barbaric , feudal system and implement a marriage system which is truly equal for both men and women .
It established the complete freedom of marriage and divorce , abolished the marriage system of contracting , coercion and buying and selling of marriages , and prohibited the rearing of child daughters @-@ in @-@ law .
The law has been implemented in all of the areas under Soviet jurisdiction during the past 2 years .
All those who are not related by blood and are outside of the 5 @-@ generation group , who are not insane and do not have serious infectious diseases , can be married if the male is 20 years old and the female 18 , and if both agree to it and it has been registered with the rural or urban Soviet .
The only requirement needed for divorce is for either the husband or wife to make the request and duly register it with the township or city soviet .
This type of democratic marriage system has smashed the feudal fetters which have shackled mankind , especially its females , for many thousands of years .
This is also.a great victory in the history of mankind .
This is a victory to be attained only after the worker @-@ peasant democratic dictatorship has been successful , First , the dictatorship of the landlord bourgeois must be overthrown , the agrarian revolution carried out and the masses of men and women , especially the women , have political and relative economic freedom .
Only then will the freedom of -marriage be finally guaranteed .
The new system can be wholly initiated because the working women in the Soviet area have the same right to vote as the men , and they have also been distributed land and assigned work .
The current Soviet marriage law emphasizes the protection of women because the marriage relationship for the past several thousand years has been barbarously inhumane .
Women are subjected to more oppression than men , and the obligations arising from divorces have been placed more heavily on the men to shoulder .
In the society that has passed it was customary not to pay too much attention to the protection of children .
But children are the new generation of the revolution .
There is a .law solely concerned with the protection of children in the marriage laws , and it has underscored the protection of illegitimate children and the acceptance of their status .
The implementation of the marriage system won for the Soviet the support of the broad masses .
The broad masses of people have not only achieved liberation economically , but also in relationships between men and women .
With just the marriage system as an example , the Soviet areas and the Kupmintang areas are two diametrically opposed worlds .
Finally , we shall talk about our policy regarding nationalities .
The basis from which the Soviet nationalities policy proceeds is winning over all oppressed minority nationalities and rally them around the Soviet , and increasing the revolutionary forces opposing imperialism and the Kuomintang .
Many of the minority nationalities such as the Mongols , , Tibetans , Koreans , Annamese , Miao and Li in China have always been ruled and exploited by Chinese feudal emperors and feudal warlords .
After inheriting this rule ^ the Kuomintang has made no changes , and the so @-@ called &quot; five nationalities in harmonious peace &quot; is just so much nonsense used to dupe people .
The Kuomintang &apos;s recent &quot; reward &quot; was the massacre of Hui people in Kansu Province carried out by Feng Yu @-@ hsiang &#91; 7458 3768 4382 &#93; and the slaughtering of the Miao people by Fai Chung @-@ hsi &#91; 4101 1504 4406 &#93; in Kwangsi .
On the other side , the ruling class within the minority nationalities themselves , such as the kings and princes , living buddhas , lamas and headmen , collaborated with the Kuomintang landlords of China and brought even more severe oppression and exploitation upon the broad masses of laboring people of the minority nationalities .
Or they ( like Tibet , Sinkiang and Inner Mongolia ) capitulated to the imperialists and led imperialism to rapidly turn these areas into colonies and carried the robbing of the working people a step forward .
This was the essence of the lives of minority nationalities in the past .
The Soviet Government firmly opposes imperialist and Kuomintang warlords7 rule and plunder perpetrated upon the minority nationalities .
Article 14 of the Constitution proclaimed by the First National Soviet Congress in November 1931 says ; &quot; The Chinese Soviet political power recognises the autonomous right of minority nationalities within the boundaries of China right up to the time they secede from China and establish their own independent and free nations .
All Mongolians , Huis , Tibetans , Miaos , Lis and Koreans residing within the boundaries of China will decide in accordance with the wishes of each nationality whether to participate in the Chinese Soviet Union or cecede from it .
The Chinese Soviet political power currently must strive to help these weak , minority nationalities to get out from under the oppressive rule of imperialism , Kuomintang warlords , kings , princes , lamas and headmen and attain complete liberation , .
The Soviet should develop their own language and culture among these nationalities . &quot;
This is a resounding answer to the vicious colonial policy applied to nationalities by imperialists all over the world ( including the Chinese Kuomintang ) .
The broad masses of workers and peasants of China and their Soviet Government are not only seeking to get rid of the shackles of imperialism by waging a resolute national revolutionary war on its own but also call upon all weak , minority nationalities in the country to do so at the same time until these nationalities have been able to cut themselves away and achieve complete independence .
Besides , Article 15 of the Soviet Constitution Outline says :
&quot; The various nationalities in China , as well as revolutionary fighters of the various countries in the world , who are being persecuted by the reactionary rulers because of their revolutionary activities will be given the right to asylum in the Soviet areas by the Chinese Soviet Government , and help will be extended to them to recover their strength to struggle again until the revolutionary movement of these nationalities and nations have achieved complete victory . &quot;
The existence of many Korean , Taiwanese and Annmese revolutionary comrades in temporary residence in the Soviet areas , the attendance of Korean representatives at the First All @-@ Soviet Congress and the attendance of several Korean , Taiwanese and Annamese representatives at this Congress prove that this proclamation of the Soviet is true .
The common revolutionary interests of the Chinese and minority nationality working people have truly united them .
The oppression of nationality is based upon the exploitation of the nationality and when this system of national exploitation is overthrown , the free union of nationalities will be substituted for national oppression .
This is possible only when the Soviet political power has won complete victory , It is the responsibility of the various minority nationalities to support and help the Soviet political power to win victory throughout
China .
The Concrete Fighting Tasks of the Soviet in Striving to Smash Thoroughly the Fifth &quot; Encirclement and Suppression &quot; and Win Nationwide Victory for the Revolution
After we have discussed the current situation , the struggle of the Soviet political power against imperialism and against &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; during the past 2 years , and the basic policies implemented by the Soviet , we arrived at a determined conclusion and , that is to say , the Soviet movement is progressing with giant strides .
The victory of the Soviet movement in the past 2 years has brought about a visible change in the strengths of both the enemy and ourselves .
The vacillation and collapse of the enemy is accelerating while the Soviet movement is vigorously developing .
The forces of revolution have grown , even greater , and the battle lines of the revolution have become even more consolidated .
The national war and the revolutionary Civil War are being waged within the vast confines of China , and the Red Army has become an invincible force .
The foundation of the democratic worker @-@ peasant dictatorship has been established .
The Soviet * s work of construction has achieved great results in various respects , The centralized leadership of the Soviet Central Government has not only established a solid foundation in the Soviet areas , but it has also become the revolutionary banner of the broad masses in the areas under the Kuomintang rule .
All these have become the current realities of : life , they have become realities existing objectively and which are not to be denied .
But the progress of the revolution has required us to take into consideration other situations .
It required us to apply an intensive spirit of self @-@ criticism to examine the weaknesses existing in the revolutionary fronts .
This is a responsibility we cannot disregard .
In evaluating our weaknesses , we must first of all realize &apos; that although the areas where the Soviet has already been victorious is very large , it is situated in very small and narrow confines when the entire country is taken as a whole , and in areas
where the economy is relatively backward .
The counterrevolutionaries still have their vast areas and occupy the important cities .
The task of the Soviet seeking nationwide victory by first achieving victories in one or several provinces rests very heavily upon our shoulders .
The daily intensifying life @-@ and @-@ death struggle between two political powers requires us to go all out to resolve this problem .
It does not permit the slightest bit of complacency to exist in our revolutionary ranks , and it also does not permit the slightest appearance of fatigue in our attitudes .
Second , although the people &apos;s- anti @-@ imperialist movement has unfolded on a massive scale in the past 2 years and considerable achievements attained in the leadership given by the Central Government in the anti @-@ imperialist movement , the forces engaged in the currently developing struggle against imperialism is woefully inadequate seen in the light of the grave nature of the national peril and the seriousness of our task to stop imperialist aggression and the capitulation and national betrayal of the Kuomintang .
The Soviet has not yet adopted numerous ways to spark the national and class consciousness of the broad masses and organize their struggle against imperialism .
Notwithstanding this fact , the Soviet Government &apos;s direct aid and leadership of the anti @-@ imperialist struggle launched at the initiative of the &apos; -masses are very much inadequate .
The Soviet Government has not fully discharged its responsibility with regard to the organization and leadership of the workers &apos; struggle against the bourgeoisie and the peasants &apos; struggle against landlords in the vast areas under White domination .
In the Kuomintang areas surrounding the Soviet areas , it also has not exerted the greatest effort to organise the people &apos;s struggle and create conditions that will rapidly transform them into Soviet areas , bring about ever @-@ increasing efforts of the masses to coordinate with the Red Army &apos;s campaigns in these areas , and , especially , the situation wherein soldiers of the White Armies rebel in support of the Red Army ,
Third , the Red Army &apos;s entire -military strength is still far from being able to accomplish the great task of defeating imperialism and the Kuomintang and achieving victory for the revolution throughout the country although numerically and qualitatively it has been increased and improved .
The rear echelon work of expanding the Red Army still cannot meet the requirements of the front , and in many respects the organizing and training of Red Guard Forces and Young Pioneers leave much to be desired .
Also , the organizing of guerrilla units and their activities are generally very inadequate .
Tn some areas the work of giving preferential treatment to families of Red Army members is very poorly carried out .
These have caused achievements in the revolution to remain at a standstill and prevented us from being able to pursue in the flush of victory and win even greater victories each time we smashed the enemy &apos;s &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot;
Fourth , with a mission of giving everything for the war effort , we still are unable to conform our work to the needs of the revolution .
Regardless of whether it is with respect to land struggle , workers &apos; struggle , economic construction , finance , suppression of counterrevolution and cultural and education , each has its own weaknesses .
In pointing out these weaknesses
in general , we would like to say that the revolution requires this work to garner greater achievements with the greatest speed .
But this work is being carried out very unevenly in the various areas .
Many areas have truly attained the standard of greatest speed and greatest achievements .
Reliance on the work of these areas has been of great help to the revolution .
.
However , in some other areas work progress has been very slow and , in some cases , achievements that should have been attained are still unreachable after a long period of time .
Especially in some newly established areas and border areas , the work is done even more poorly .
The main reason for this is that in the Soviet organizations of these areas there exist elements who do not understand and are even unwilling to carry out , the laws and policies of the Soviet .
Some of these elements are people gravely afflicted with opportunism and bureaucracism , but others are outright spies sent in by the .landlord bourgeoisie .
They do not advance the work of the Soviet but impede it .
They did not subordinate Soviet work to the war efforts ^ but caused it to become separated from it .
They were not willing to develop the struggle of the masses and brought it to a standstill .
Instead of proceeding from -mobilizing the broad masses and doing education work on them , they tried to implement the Soviet &apos;s work through empty talk and clamor , even to the extent of using coercive orders of bureaucraticism .
Instead of trying to understand the situation at lower levels , educating new cadres and soliciting suggestions from the masses , they slandered lower level cadres and said that the masses do not have enthusiasm .
The Soviet democracy was not fully developed in these respects .
It did not attract a majority of the masses to participate in the election of Soviets or attract large numbers of intellectuals from the masses to participate in the work of the Soviet .
The system of urban and rural congresses of representatives has not been firmly established in these areas , nor the Soviet transformed into a political organization that is truly of the masses .
For these reasons , many aspects of the Soviet &apos;s work did not achieve what should have &quot; been achieved in these areas and they were unable to meet the pressing needs of the revolution .
It should be clearly pointed out that this is the gravest shortcoming in the Soviet &apos;s work .
All of these weaknesses have placed us on the highest alert to overcome them so that the Soviet movement will be able to conform with all objective and favorable conditions and expand on an even more massive scale over an even more vast territory .
We already have one great force , , and it has become the foundation for our expansion .
But it is insufficient because the requirement of the revolutionary situation exceeds its capability , and we must strengthen it .
The Second All ^ China Congress of Soviet Representatives must call on the revolutionary masses in all of the Soviet areas and all of China to resolutely carry out the following concrete fighting tasks in order to thoroughly sniash the imperialists1 and Kuomintang &apos;s &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; and win nationwide victory for the revolution :
On building the Red Army .
Further strengthen , and perfect the leadership of the Central Revolutionary Military Affairs Committee over the Red Army so that the activities of the Red Array throughout China will , under a unified strategic will , become even more mutually supportive and mutually coordinated than in the past , and the local military organizations will &quot; be able to discharge their own duties under the central leadership .
Propagate on a general and penetrating scale the slogan &quot; expand the Red Army into an iron force at least a million strong &quot; into the ranks of the worker @-@ peasant masses throughout the Soviet areas and throughout China , calling upon the broad masses to struggle for the realization of this slogan in the shortest time possible .
The masses must be made to understand that the Imminent struggle to decide victory or defeat between the Soviet political power and the Kuomintang political power , and the direct and massive struggle between the Soviet political power and imperialism is entirely dependent upon the establishment of the Red Army .
This task is a sacred responsibility of the Soviet and each one of the workers and peasants .
The Central Revolutionary Military Affairs Committee and the various Soviets should be responsible for collecting the rich experiences gained in expanding the Red Army in various areas during the last 2 years , especially since Red May of last year .
It is emphatically pointed out that in expanding the Red Army , is for political encouragement to be used instead qf forceful coercion .
We must deal with alien and bad elements who sabotage effqrts to expand the Red Army and lead to desertion by applying merciless class struggle and the Soviet &apos;s laws concerning such matters .
All laws and methods of the Soviet for the preferential treatment of Red Army fighters and their families -must be implemented .
We must raise the social status of Red Army fighters , heightening the spiritual comfort of the Red Army fighters and their families and resolving material difficulties in their lives .
It is also necessary to point out that cultivating land for families of Red Army members and providing them with daily necessities are an important part of the work to give preferential treatment .
All those who drag their feet , are apathetic and feigned compliance with regard to the preferential treatment of Red Army fighters and their families should be prosecuted under Soviet law .
Place the work of consolidating the Red Army in .
a place of importance in the work of building the Red Army so that it will not only be able to expand very quickly , but also become strong and healthy very rapidly .
Political education of Red Army fighters should be elevated even further so that each one of them will consciously struggle to the end for the Soviet New China , so that the Red Army is transformed into a propagandist and organizer for the Soviet and a creator of new Soviet territories .
The relationship between the Red Army fighters and the laboring masses of workers and peasants in both the Soviet and White areas becomes even -more closely linked .
Enhance the conscious discipline of the Red Army through political
education and make them understand that this is an important weapon guaranteer @-@ ing victory in the war .
The system of political commissars should be established throughout all Red Army ?
local and guerrilla units , and foster even more worker elements to Become military and political commanders .
Transform the Red Army school to train better than in the past large numbers of senior and junior grade military and political cadres .
Search for bad elements within the Red Army and deal severely with the attempts of landlord bourgeois elements who have stolen in to sabotage the Red Army .
The work of consolidating the Red Army so as to transform it into a form of iron is of the same importance as political work .
It is what the Red Army urgently needs now .
Improving the Red Army &apos;s military techniques is of vital importance to us in the face of the daily growing scale of the war and the daily adoption of new military techniques by imperialist and Kuomintang troops .
The slogan &quot; Master and improve on new military techniques &quot; should penetrate &apos; deeply &quot; into the minds of the Red Army fighters and the Red Army school should exert its greatest efforts toward this end .
The new method of organizing Red Guard Forces and Young Pioneers units should be propagated to reach every nook and cranny of the Soviet areas and arm all of the youths and adult males and females of the working class .
Every one of the members of the Red Guard Forces and the Young Pioneers should be made to understand clearly the roles and responsibilities of the Red Army &apos;s rear support troops and local defense forces .
The necessity for and the role to be played by obligatory service in the forthcoming Civil War which will be waged on an even bigger scale should be suitably propagated now to the broad masses of working people and members of the Red Guard Forces and the Young Pioneers , An all @-@ out effort should be made to carry out necessary military and political training whenever possible .
Spread the method of bivouaking and maneuvers to all Red Guard Forces and Young Pioneer units in all areas .
Under a situation of enemy attacks and attempts at trouble @-@ making by exploiting elements in the Soviet areas , the responsibility of the Red Guard Forces and Young Pioneer units for the defense of the area should be increased in a special manner , and existing slackness in Red martial law in many areas should be speedily corrected .
One of the best means to expand the Red Army is to mobilize model units of the Red Guard Forces and Young Pioneers , immediately recognize these troops after mobilization and enlist them into the Red Army by the whole unit and by the entire company .
It is the Red guerrilla units of new and border areas and in the areas between the Soviet and the White areas who play the great role of detachments of the Red Army inseparable from the Red Army in battle .
The most pressing task of the Soviet is to strengthen and enlarge present guerrilla units , establish new guerrilla units on a most widespread scale , collect the rich experiences of guerrilla warfare of the past , massively strengthen education an &apos;d instruction in guerrilla tactics , send forth hundreds and thousands of guerrilla units into the White areas and into the rear and flanks of the enemy to attack them there , develop mass struggle , create guerrilla areas and expand them into new Soviet areas and , especially ,
be active in the areas between the Soviet territories which have not yet been linked up in coordination with the activities of the lied Army &apos;s main force .
All means should be applied to ensure the supply and transportation of the Red Army &apos;s rations .
The finance and economic organizations of the Soviet , and the supply , transportation and health organizations within the military system should strive together to attain this common objective .
Past shortcomings should be overcome in the mobilization of transport units so that there will be no shortage of transportation personnel to hinder the mobility and combat of the Red Army , All for the war effort is the responsibility of every revolutionary and every worker of the Soviet .
On economic construction .
The Soviet should carry out various necessary and feasible economic construction in a planned -manner for the purpose of Breaking through the enemy &apos;s blockade , opposing the manipulations of unscupulous merchants , ensuring the needs of the revolution , vand improve the well @-@ being of the worker @-@ peasant masses .
First and foremost is the development of the vast agricultural production in the Soviet areas .
The Soviet should use all means to heighten the enthusiasm of the peasantry for production , It should take advantage of the important seasons for agricultural work , such as spring and summer plowing and fall harvesting , to launch a general and widespread movement to increase production and mobilize the entire peasantry of the rural areas to plunge together into the front lines of production .
An important method to increase production is to organize labor cooperatives and plowing units , distribute the rural labor force in a planned way and mobilize the broad masses of women tq participate in production .
Help and leadership should be provided to the peasants in solving concrete and important problems of agriculture , such as plow oxen , farm implements , fertilizers , seeds , irrigation and pest prevention .
Plow oxen cooperatives should be set up on a general scale .
Based upon the experience gained from the spring and summer plowing campaign of last year , , &quot; Completely eliminate waste land &apos; 1 and &quot; Increase this year &apos;s harvest by 20 percent &quot; should become battle slogans .
Experiences in planting cotton should be collected and the production of cotton in the Soviet areas should be developed .
A movement to plant trees should be launched ?
calling upon every person in the rural areas to plant 10 trees .
The Soviet should pay attention to increasing stock animal raising .
The Ministry of the People &apos;s Council on National Economy of the Central Government and the Departments of National Economy of various provinces should set forth concrete plans of action in such important departments of agriculture as food grains , cotton and others .
The Sovietrs Department of Food Grains , the Bureau of Food Grains Distribution and food grain cooperatives of the masses should closely link together in work and strive hard to ensure the supply of food grains to the Red Army and the people ,
The recovery of the large , handicraft enterprises and the construction of needed military Industries are important tasks of the SovietTs economic
construction .
The Soviet &apos;s plan to recover and expand industry should be based upon the needs of the war ?
the needs of the people in the Soviet areas and the possibility of exporting to the White areas ?
wolfram , coal . , iron , lime , agricultural implements , tobacco , paper , cloth , sugar . , medicine , nitre , camphor and lumber should be the main departments .
A major effort should be made to develop people &apos;s production cooperatives of these indus ^ tries , and organize as many as possible unemployed workers , independent laborers and peasants and bring them into production cooperatives .
At the same time , permit and reward private capitalists to invest and expand these productions in the Soviet areas .
Currently , the Soviet should not attempt to monopolize all production , enterprises , but the founding and expansion of especially needed and especially profitable state enterprises is permissible and should be done .
An important way to increase production is to heighten enthusiasm for labor , launch competitions in production and reward those making outstanding achievements on the production front .
The smashing of the enemy &apos;s economic blockade , developing the Soviet areas &apos; trade with the outside , exchanging surplus items ( such as unhusked grain , wolfram , lumber , tobacco and paper ) produced in the Soviet areas with industrial commodities from the White areas ( such as table salt , cloth @-@ and kerosene ) are the pivots in the development of the national economy .
The Soviet Bureau of External -Trade and other commercial organizations must be further improved and strengthened .
At the same time , reward private businessmen and &quot; bring them to work hard toward the import and export of needed commercial commodities .
Consumer cooperatives are to be developed on a general scale and organize the broad masses of workers and peasants within these cooperatives so that the masses will be able to buy necessary items from the White areas at a cheap price and sell the products from Soviet areas at a high price .
All these occupy especially important positions in the Soviet &apos;s trade and in the entire project of economic construction .
The Soviet should greatly strengthen its leadership over the general consumer cooperative of the Central Government and the general consumer cooperatives of the provinces and counties , and establish general cooperatives as quickly as possible in areas where they have not yet been established .
In economic construction , the solution of the problem of capital is achieved mainly through the absorption of capital from the masses .
Organize them into the production consumer and credit cooperatives and attention should be paid to the development of credit cooperatives so that after usurious capital has been done away with the credit cooperatives can be substituted .
Absorbing the capital of the masses into the construction of state enterprises , expansion of trade with outside areas and assisting cooperative enterprises through such means as issuing economic construction bonds , issu- ^ ing bank shares and deposits in banks are equally important .
Use all possible means to encourage private capitalists to invest within the boundaries of Soviet laws so that capital in the Soviet areas is more viable .
The role of the Soviet Bank should be given free rein by all possible means , issuing suitable amount of scripts in accordance with the principle of market demand , absorbing the deposits of the masses , making loans to profitable production enterprises , allocate the finances of the entire Soviet areas in a planned way , and lead the people &apos;s cooperatives to struggle against speculative businessmen .
All these are the tasks of the banks ,
On Soviet construction .
The establishment of the Central Government provided general leadership to the Soviet movement throughout the country and it is of absolute significance to the Chinese revolution .
It has achieved a great and glorious victory in leading the struggle against imperialism and the Kuomintang during the past 2 years .
We should point out that the Central Government , in its organization and work , is still not sound and adequate enough in many areas .
In order to strengthen the Central Government &apos;s general leadership of the various Soviet areas and the revolution throughout the country it will be necessary to separate the work of the Central Executive Committee from that of the People &apos;s Committee .
Faced with a situation of accelerated development of the revolution , it will be necessary to make the work and the organization of the Central Executive Committee &apos;s presidium quite sound , the staff of the various people &apos;s committees must be fleshed out and their work methods improved and more peopleTs committee departments must be established , such as the people &apos;s committee department of food grain , so as to enable the Central Government to play its full role as principal motive force .
The provincial Soviet is the supreme organization of leadership for the local political power , and it is the Central Government &apos;s link with the various county and area Soviets .
We must make a great effort to strengthen the Central Government &apos;s leadership of the various provinces , closely link the relationship between it and the various provincial Soviets ( the provincial Soviets in the central Soviet area and those outside ) and closely scrutinize the work of the various provincial Soviets , .put into effect the systems of collective discussion , precise division of labor and individual responsibility .
We must scrutinize the work of the various Soviet areas in the counties and strive hard to correct the phenomena of slackened efforts and non ^ centralization which had occurred in the past in some areas .
As township and city Soviets are the basic organizations of the Soviet , we must go all @-@ out to improve the work of these Soviets .
In those areas where a congress of representatives does not exist , it must be established .
Further strengthen its work and form a presidium for the Congress .
The many committees under the Congress should be formed and spread this system of committees into the rural areas , attracting large groups of worker @-@ peasant activists to join the committees and work in them .
A system whereby close relationships may be maintained between a representative and a definite number of residents must be set up , a system of chairmen of representatives formed so that there will be one in each village to oversee the work of the entire village , and he should be permitted to convene a meeting between a representative of a hamlet and its inhabitants to discuss the work being done in the hamlet .
The township and city Soviets are organizations directly responsible for mobilizing the masses and carrying out the work of the Soviet .
The focus of its work should be how to mobilize the masses of the village or township in the soundest and most adequate way
and struggle to implement successfully each task and each piece of work of the Soviet .
The village and ward Soviets must give their greatest attention to the practical work.being done by the village or street , and implement a system of scheduled examination of their work .
An effective way to achieve speed in work is the revolutionary competition between the various villages or streets .
The speedy and thorough improvement of village and ward Soviets is dependent upon the correct and practical leadership of the area and municipal Soviets .
The attention of the area and municipal Soviets should be placed fully upon the improvement of the work of the village and street Soviets , and the key to the leadership of the area and municipal Soviets is full explanations , constant inspections , thorough examinations and tests by the people .
The county Soviet should apply these as criteria in examinr @-@ ing the work of the area Soviet .
The Soviet of various provinces must place its own attention strongly upon the newly formed Soviet areas , and regard the work of establishing revolutionary committees and strenthening their work as its important duty .
The essence of the work and the form of the organization of revolutionary com &lt; -mittees are in many places different from those of the village or township .
The transformation of all White areas into Soviet areas has to pass through the stage of revolutionary committee .
The provincial Sovietsf the Soviets of various new and boundary areas and the county soviet should place the organizational structure and work of revolutionary committees on a sound basis so that they will be able to shoulder the responsibility of arming the people , launching people &apos;s struggles , wiping out reactionary forces and speedily switching over to the establishment of the Soviet political power .
Although Soviet democracy has developed , we should point out that there is still much to be desired in many areas , and it is necessary that a serious struggle be launched against bureaucracy to eliminate those obsolete thingsbureaucraticism and commandismhidden in the Soviets and among the people .
The functionaries ( cadres of the Soviets ) should carry out their work by mobilization and persuasion , and not by compulsory orders .
They should be attentive to , and not ignore , each and every request or suggestion from the masses .
Personnel of the Soviets , especially the procurate committee of the workers and peasants , should induce the broad masses to launch criticism and struggle against bad elements within the Soviet organizations and sternly prosecute them under the laws of the Soviet so as to ensure that there will be good relationship between the Soviet and the people .
In order to have sound elements in the Soviet , it will be necessary to popularize the election of Soviets , explain the meaning of elections to the people and induce the greatest majority of the voters to participate in the elections .
In elections , those class alien elements and elements who are corrupt , wasteful and bureaucratic must be absolutely expelled and large numbers of workers @-@ peasant activists elected to manage the stateTs work .
Here , letting in large groups of worker cadres , in accordance with the election laws to strengthen the workers * position of leadership
201in the Soviet political power , is a key link in placing the work of the Soviet on a sound basis .
The Soviet must maintain close link with trade unions , poor peasants &apos; groups , representatives * congresses of women workers , and farmers , cooperatives and all other civic groups so as to popularize the work of the Soviet , and carry out the work of the Soviet by mobilizing the broad masses of people through these groups .
In order to acquire speed and quality in the work of the Soviet so that all work will meet the requirements of the revolution , it is necessary to exert maximum effort to eliminate the &apos; relaxed and placid attitudes of Soviet functionaries and greatly heighten their work enthusiasm so that each one of them will consciously put out effort in the work of the state under the democratic dictatorship of the workers and peasants .
Work discipline must be strict .
All those elements who fritter away their time and neglect their duties and do not give importance to the work of the Soviet must be struggled against severely until they are expelled from their work .
Corruption and waste must be opposed because not only do these phenomena inflict loss upon the finances and economy of the Soviet , but they also corrupt Soviet functionaries , cause them to lose enthusiasm for their work and lose spiritual essence .
The slogans of &quot; Subordinate all work to the war effort &quot; and &quot; Achieve speed and quality in work &quot; must be set before the masses , and , in this respect , the principal responsible persons , especially the worker @-@ peasant procuratory committee , should adequately carry out the work of persuasive education upon Soviet functionaries .
Place the burden of thoroughly and conscientiously carrying out the policies and laws of the Soviet on the shoulders of all Soviet functionaries .
Impose heavy penalties on transgressions against Soviet laws and policies , first and foremost on such misdeeds by the Soviet functionaries themselves .
The Labor Law must be implemented in full , and every article of it explained to the broad masses of workers .
The application of the 8 @-@ hour work system and the stipulation of minimum wage are the core to ensuring the interests of the workers .
The labor inspection stations and the labor courts must see to it that they become fully effective .
We must conduct resolute struggle against those personnel who neglect the interests of the workers and attempt to seek compromise with the capitalists , provide practical and timely aid to unemployed workers , and organize committees on aid to the unemployed in all the areas where there are unemployed workers .
The system of social insurance must be put into effect where It Is possible and required attention paid to the work of the social insurance bureau , avoiding past errors made in some areas with regard to the disbursement of insurance funds .
The labor department of the Soviet should be placed on a sound basis in order to carry out this work fully , and there should be a close relationship between the labor department and the trade unions .
One of the central tasks of the Soviet is to fully implement the land law and all the laws governing the struggle for land by launching a massive campaign of agrarian revolution throughout the country .
The struggle to confiscate land owned by the landlord class and big private land holders should be launched with emphasis and intensity in all the newly acquired territories of the Soviet .
The many experiences accumulated from methods used in the past to distribute land should be collected and applied generally to all new Soviet areas .
Develop the land inspection movement in all those areas where the land problem has not yet been throughly resolved , and rapidly sweep away from those areas the remnant forces of feudalism .
A correct class line and adequate work on the masses in the agrarian struggle are prerequisites guaranteeing absolute victory in the agrarian revolution .
Implementing the Soviet policy on culture and education , launching a cultural revolution within the soviet territories , arming the minds of the masses with communism , enhancing the cultural standard of the masses , putting into effect the system of compulsory education and strengthening the ability to mobilize the masses in the course of the revolution are tasks of similar importance for the Soviet .
The Soviet policy o punishing exploiters and suppressing counterrevolu ~ tionaries must be carried out with determination .
The state &apos;s Bureau of Political Defense and the Soviet courts must enhance their own levels of alertness and sternly punish and suppress elements of the exploiting class who transgress against Soviet laws and all those who are engaged in counterrevolutionary activities .
In this respect , the work of the Bureau of Political Defense , the popularization of the Soviet courts , the mobilization of the broad masses to participate in the struggle to suppress counterrevolutionaries are of vital importance .
The general orientation of the Soviet &apos;s work in acquiring speed and quality in the work of the Soviet and making all the work of the Soviet meet entirely with the needs of the revolution .
On leading struggle against imperialism and work in White areas .
The Soviet Government must strengthen its leadership of the nationwide struggle against imperialism and the revolutionary struggles of workers and peasants in the Kuomintang areas in order to oppose imperialist aggression , unfold an intense struggle of workers and peasants over the whole country and expand the Soviet area to cover the entire nation .
Apathy in this respect is tantamount to letting loose the bandit @-@ like aggression of imperialism , prolonging the life of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and restricting the speed and limits of the expansion of Soviet areas .
The Soviet Central Government and the various provincial Soviets must extend their views into the vast areas under the Kuomintang .
They must not only lead every anti @-@ imperialist movement launched by the masses on their own initiative , but also utilize each concrete fact of imperialist aggression and the Kuomintang &apos;s capitulation and national betrayal to rouse the national and class consciousness of the masses in the ranks of the broad masses of workers and peasants and among the petite bourgeoisie , and , call them to organize and arm for the struggle to drive out imperialism and defend the territory of China .
Especially in the three eastern provinces ( Kirin , Heulungkiang and Liaoning ) , Jehol , Chahar , north China and areas where the Japanese imperialists are attacking , organize people &apos;s revolutionary armies and volunteer armies , lead the original volunteer army and
bring them out from under the reaction influence of the Kuomintang to wage resolute war with the Japanese imperialists .
The Soviet Government must give all possible material and moral support to every one of the anti @-@ imperialist strikes launched by workers and the antl @-@ imperialist struggle of the peasants and petite bourgeoisie .
The Soviet must use all possible means to organize , help and lead workers &apos;struggle against the bourgeoisie and peasants &apos; struggle against the landlords erupting in the Kuomintang areas .
Every one of the Soviet personnel should understand that they must place their greatest attention upon the White dominated areas if they desire to develop the Soviet movement to envelop the entire country , create conditions to transform into Soviet territory the Kuomintang dominated areas which are several times larger than the Soviet &apos;s , establish new Soviet areas and be able to receive the help of the masses of the White areas in the struggle against imperialism and the massive &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; of the Kuomintang .
Prepared with all the material support needed , personnel must be dispatched from the Soviet areas to organize and lead the mass struggles in the White areas .
Apathy in this respect is tantamount to apathy toward the expansion of the Soviet area and developing the revolution .
Especially the masses in the Kuomintang areas in the vicinity of the Soviet territories have been most heavily influenced by the Soviet and they suffer most from the oppression of Kuomintang ( s military bondage and monopoly of salt .
The Soviet Government , especially the government of the various provincial Soviets , border counties and border areas must use every opportunity to achieve a link @-@ up with these people , organize their daily struggles and develop them into guerrilla warfare and mass uprising , until a Soviet area has been established and it is linked with the old Soviet areas .
In this respect , great importance should be placed on the work done in the boundary areas between the Soviet and White territories .
In these areas , the Soviet ( or the revolutionary committee ) and the guerrilla units must completely abide by the basic policies of the Soviet .
All indiscriminate beatings of local bullies without class distinction is prohibited .
Confiscated money and property of landlord bourgeoisie and reactionaries must be distributed among the local people .
Besides , effectively resolve such problems as the confrontation of Red and White , civilian deserters , the salt blockade and civilian victims in accordance with the class and mass lines and eliminate the cause of confrontations between Red and White and civilian desertion .
And improvement in the work carried out in the boundary areas is an important link in securing the transformation of White areas into Soviet areas .

CONCLUSIONS 01 ?
REPORT OF CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 27 January 1934
&#91; Text &#93; Comrades !
You have discussed for 2 days ~ -in the subgroup meeting held yesterday and in todayTs general conference- ^ -the report I presented on behalf of the Central Executive Committee and the People &apos;s Committee .
In these 2 days , you have made many suggestions expressing in an all @-@ round manner the lessons and experiences from our work done during the past 2 years .
In summation , it can be said that there was unanimous agreement with my report .
With regard to the current situation , the tasks that emerged from this situation , the implementation of Soviet policies in various areas during the past 2 years and shortcomings that exist in our work , there was general agreement in the discussions you held yesterday and today .
The speeches made by the comrades were generally very correct .
This should be pointed out in the first place .
It behooves me to point out that in the discussions of yesterday and today , mainly in the meeting of the subgroup held yesterday , incorrect views were encompassed in the speeches made by individual comrades .
These were mainly opinions expressed on the question of the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; On this question the majority of the comrades accepted what I had said in my report : We have won the initial victory of the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; but the final and decisive battle still faces us gravely .
It is our current most important task to call upon the broad masses , unite all fprces and strive for victory in the final and decisive battle of the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; Some comrades said in the discussion that &quot; the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppressionT has Been completely smashed , &quot; and this viewpoint is obviously incorrect .
Other comrades said : &quot; We are preparing to smash the fifth &apos; encirclement and suppression7 , &quot; and this viewpoint is also wrong .
We overestimated our own victory and lightly did away with the Soviet &apos;s task to smash the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; in the end , while in reality Chiang Kai @-@ shek is concentrating all his forces for a final , massive offensive against us .
This kind of estimation is erroneous , and it is also very dangerous .
It is erroneous not to see that the Red Army has dealt the enemy quite a serious blow in the past several months of arduous fighting and has won an initial &apos; victory .
This kind of victory , in combination with the great victory of smashing the fourth &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; forms a solid foundation for thoroughly smashing the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; Underestimating our own achievements is similarly very dangerous .
A comrade said that there was some revolutionary essence in the Fukien People &apos;s Revolutionary Government and that it is not wholly counterrevolutionary .
This view is also wrong .
In my report , 1 have already pointed out that the People &apos;s Revolutionary Government is but a faction of the reactionary ruling class , and it is a new trick used to swindle the people in order to preserve itself from death .
They regard the Soviet as an enemy , and the facade of the Kuomintang is too dilapidated .
They came up with this People &apos;s Revolutionary Government , using the gambit of the third road to swindle the people in this manner .
There is not a bit of revolutionary essence to it .
Current facts have already proven this to be so .
Another comrade made erroneous remarks in the subgroup meeting , He said that the Soviet has not expanded the Red Army , and it does not have any guerrilla units , that the peasants still have to pay rent to the landlords .
These remarks are , of course , quite inane , and require no further explanation .
Yet , another comrade said that the functionaries in Fukien were all oppor ^ -tunists .
Without the need of an explanation , everybody will recognize this as erroneous .
We admit that there are opportunists among some of the Soviet functionaries fomenting trouble and we should launch resolute struggle against such elements .
But remarks such as the one the comrade made vilify the Soviet .
With regard to marriage . , I ; have already said in my report that should one party of the marriage resolutely request divorcef the Soviet should grant it .
It should be pointed out that the families of Red Army members are exceptions .
In order to strengthen the will to fight in a Red Army fighter , the Central Government has resolved that a wife of a Red Army fighter can request a divorce only with the concurrance of her husband .
Divorce can be requested by the wife alone only after 2 years have elapsed with no news from her husband .
Quite a few of the comrades have proposed lowering the eligibility age for marriage .
I do not feel that such suggestions are sound .
In the interests of the race and of the class , the marriage age should not be lower than 20 for men and 18 for women .
We should understand that early marriage is extremely harmful .
Comrades , be a little patient ( loud laughter burst forth in the conference hall ) .
In the days under the rule of landlord bourgeoisie , poor workers and peasants still could not marry at the age of 40 or 50 , so why is there such impatience now for 1 or 2 years ?
( more laughter from the hall ) .
The preceding has been , the first part of my conclusion , but the principal part is still to follow .
A yery important question on which the comrades have not focused their attention in the discussions is the well @-@ being of the people with the revolution .
This question was not pointed out with emphasis in yesterday &apos;s and todayTs discussions .
I feel that it should be clearly set forth .
The central task of the Soviet at present is to mobilize the broad masses to take part in the revolution , overthrow imperialism and the Kuomintang by means of such wa , r , spread the revolution throughout the country and drive imperialism
out of China .
Leading the revolution and organizing the revolution are central tasks of the Soviet , and anyone who does not attach enough importance to this central task is not a good revolutionary cadre .
A good Soviet cadre should have a clear and profound view of this central task .
If he truly perceives this task with clarity and understands that spreading the revolution is our basic and pressing task , that the revolution must at all cost be spread throughout the country , then he should in no way neglect or underestimate the question of immediate interests , the well @-@ being , of the masses .
Why ?
Because the revolution is a war of the masses .
It can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and relying on them .
We must place this task of waging war before the masses , and mobilize &apos; the masses on a massive scale to participate in the war and support the war effort .
Only thus can we win victory .
If we only mobilize the people to carry on the war and do nothing else , can we succeed in defeating the enemy ?
My answer is : Of course not .
If we want to win , we must do a great deal more .
We must lead the peasants &apos; struggle for land and distribute the land to them , heighten their enthusiasm for labor and increase agricultural production , safeguard the interests of the workers , establish cooperatives , develop trade with outside areas and solve the problems facing the massesfood , shelter and clothing , fuel ?
rice , cooking 6il and salt , sickness and hygiene , and marriage .
In short , all the practical problems in the everyday life of the masses should claim our attention .
If the Soviet attends to these problems , solves them and satisfies the needs of the masses , we shall really become organizers of the well @-@ being of the masses , and they will truly rally round us and give us their warm support .
Comrades , will we then be able to arouse them to take part in the revolution and sacrifice everything for the war effort ?
Yes , indeed we will ,
Here is the kind of thing we have found among Soviet organizations .
Some of the cadres talk only about expanding the Red Army , enlarging the trans ^ port corps , collecting the land tax and selling bonds ; as for other matterss they neither discuss nor attend to them , and even ignore them altogether .
For instance , there was a time when the Tring ^ chou Municipal Soviet Govern @-@ ment concerned itself with the expansion of the Red Army and with mobilization for the transport corps , and paid not the slightest attention to the well @-@ being of the masses .
The problems facing the people of TTing @-@ chou city were that they had no firewood , no salt was on sale because the capitalists were hoarding it , some people had no houses to live in and the houses confiscated from local despots have not yet been distributed to them , and rice was both scarce and dear .
These were practical problems for the masses of T &apos;ing @-@ chou and they eagerly looked toward the Soviet Government for help in solving them .
But the T &apos;ing ^ chou Municipal Soviet did not discuss any of these problems .
That is why when the new workers &apos; and peasants &apos; representative council was elected in the city , a hundred or more representatives were unwilling to attend after the first few council meetings had discussed only the expansion of the Red Army and mobilization for the transport corps , entirely ignoring the well @-@ being of the masses , so that the council was
unable to go on meeting .
The result was that very little was achieved in regard to the expansion of the Red Army and mobilization for the transport corps .
This was one kind of situation .
Comrades , you have probably read the pamphlets given you about two model township Soviets .
There the situation is entirely different .
What a great number of people have joined the Red Army from Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township in Kiangsi and Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi township in Fukien !
In Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township 80 percent of the young men and women have joined the Red Army , and in Ts &apos;ai @-@ hsi the figure is 88 percent .
There has been a big sale of bonds , too , and 4,500 yuan worth have been sold in Chang @-@ kang which has a population of 1,500 .
Much has also been done in other fields .
What accounts for this ?
A few examples will make the point clear .
In Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang when fire broke out in a poor peasant &apos;s house destroying one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half rooms , the township government immediately appealed to the masses to contribute money to help him .
In another instance , three persons were starving , so the township government and the mutual @-@ aid society immediately gave them rice .
During the food shortage last summer , the township soviet obtained rice from Kung @-@ lueh County &apos;s Shui @-@ nan &#91; 3055 0589J and Fu @-@ tTien &#91; 1381 3944 &#93; areas more than 200 li away for the relief of the masses .
Excellent work was done along these lines in TsTai @-@ hsi as well .
Such township governments are really models .
They are absolutely different from the T &apos;ing @-@ chou Municipal Government with its bureaucratic -methods of leadership .
We should learn from Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang and T &apos;sai @-@ hsi townships and oppose bureaucratic leaders like those in T ! ing @-@ chou city .
I earnestly suggest to this congress that we pay close.attention to the well @-@ being of the masses , from the problems of land and labor to those of fuel , rice , cooking oil and salt .
The women comrades want to learn plowing and harrowing .
Whom can we get to teach them ?
The children want to go to school .
Have we set : .up Lenin primary schools ?
The wooden bridge over there is too narrow and people may fall off .
Should we not repair it ?
Many people suffer from boils and other ailments .
What are we going to do about it ?
All such problems concerning the well @-@ being of the masses should be placed on our agenda .
We should discuss them , adopt and carry out decisions and check up on the results .
We should convince the masses that we represent their interests , that our lives are intimately bound up with theirs .
We should help them to proceed from these things to an understanding of the higher tasks which we have put forward , the tasks of the revolution , so that they will support the revolution and spread it throughout the country , respond to our political appeals and fight to the end for victory in the revolution .
The masses in Ch &apos; .ang @-@ kang say , &quot; The Communist Party is really good !
It has thought of everything on our behalf . &quot; The comrades in Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township are an example to all of us .
What admirable people !
They have won the genuine affection of the broad masses , who support their call for war mobilization .
Look , 80 percent of the able bodied &apos; in Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township ha , ve gone to the front !
Do we want to win the support of the masses ?
Do we want them to devote their strength to the front ?
If so , we must be with them , arouse their enthusiasm and initiative , be concerned with their well @-@ being , work earnestly and sincerely in their interests- and solve all their
problems of production and everyday lifethe problems of salt , rice , housing , clothing , childbirth , etc .
If we dp so , the masses will surely support us and regard the revolution as their most glor.iqus banner , as their very life .
In the event of a Kuomintang attack on the Red areas they will fight the Kuomintang to the death .
There can be no doubt about this , for is it not a plain fact that we have smashed the enemy ! s first , second , third and fourth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaigns ?
The Kuomintang is now pursuing a policy of blockhouse warfare , feverishly constructing their &quot; tortoise @-@ shells &quot; as though they were bastions of iron .
Are they really iron bastions ?
Not in the least !
Think of the palaces of the feudal emperors over thousands of years , were they not powerful with their walls and moats ?
Yet they crumbled one after another the moment the masses arose .
The tsar of Russia was one of the world &apos;s most ferocious rulers , yet when the proletariat and the peasantry rose in revolution , was there anything left of him ?
No , nothing .
His bastions of iron ?
They all crumbled .
Comrades !
What is a true bastion of iron ?
It is the masses , the millions upon millions of people who genuinely and sincerely support the revolution .
That is the real iron bastion which no force can smash , no force whatsoever .
The counterrevolution cannot smash us ; on the contrary , we shall smash it .
Rallying millions upon millions of people round the revolutionary government and expanding our revolution , we shall wipe out all counter ^ revolution and take over the whole of China ,
I am going to talk about the second question .
I feel that this question must also be thoughtfully brought before the Congress , The second question concerns our methods of work ,
The Soviet is the leader and organizer of the revolution as well as the leader and organizer of the life of the masses .
To develop the revolution and to improve the life of the masses are our tasks and our objectives , With regard to such tasks and objectives , we must not only discuss them , , but also carry them out .
In this respect we are faced with the serious problem of methods of work .
It is not enough to set tasks and decide on the objectives to be achieved .
We must also solve the problem of the methods for carrying them out .
If our task is to cross a river , we cannot cross it without a bridge or a boat .
Unless the bridge or boat problem is solved , it is idle to speak of crossing the river .
Unless the problem of method is solved , talk about the task is useless .
Unless we pay attention to giving leadership to the work of expanding the Red Army and devote particular care to our methodsf we will never succeed even though we recite the phrase &quot; Expand the Red Army &quot; a thousand times .
Like a monk , you may recite Amida Buddha from dawn to dusk , day in and day out and it will still be Amida Buddha .
No Red Army will materialize , ( general laughter ) .
Are there similar situations in the work of our Government ?
Of course , and , indeed , not just a few !
Let us take Jui @-@ chin and Fukien as examples .
Juir @-@ chin &apos;s recent phenomenal campaign to expand the Red Army is worthy of
our admiration .
Under the direct leadership of the Central Bureau and the Central Revolutionary Military Affairs Committee , the Red Army was expanded by nearly 4,000 during the 1 1 / 2 month period beginning 1 December .
They won the most recent campaign to expand the Red Army with phenomenal speed by applying correct methods of work , launching struggles against opportunism and bureaucraticism and by unfolding class struggles of the masses .
As for Fukien , the total achievements of more than 10 counties in the province barely equal that of Jui @-@ chin .
This was possible only because of the change in the methods of work which took place under the direct leadership of the Central Political Bureau during the recent half month .
Under the leadership of bureaucraticism , as in December , it would not have been possible to even equal the achievements of one county such as Jui @-@ chin .
Even Jui @-@ chin was able to achieve an expansion by only 30 people in the entire month of last August .
Compared with the 4,000 @-@ men expansion In the recent period of 45 days , it can be seen what a vast difference results between bureaucratic leadership and effective and concrete leadership .
Again , using the storm troop movement launched by Jui @-@ chin in December to expand the Red Army as an example . , hardly any achievements were made under the leadership of bureaucraticism in such areas as Ch &apos;eng &#91; 1004 &#93; , Hsia @-@ Jiaiao &#91; 0007 5135 &#93; and Huang @-@ po &#91; 7806 2672 &#93; in the first half of the month .
In the latter half of the month , after the storm troop leader was replaced and work @-@ methods changed , not only was the quota for the month fulfilled but it was also exceeded by 100 percent .
This was so with the movement to expand the Red Army .
Now let us next take a look at the movement to sell bonds .
By the time Jui @-@ chin has sold and completed collecting the money on 240,000 yuan of bonds , only 19,000 yuan was sold in Yu @-@ tu &#91; 7184 6757 &#93; County under the leadership of bureaucraticism , and , till today , they still have in their boxes over 100,000 yuan of the 190,000 yuan of bonds issued to them .
Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang township sold 4,500 yuan in bonds , averaging 3.80 yuan per person , If all the townships were like Ch &apos;ang @-@ kang , 12 million yuan worth of bonds can be Issued in the Central Soviet areas alone , but If it were like Yutu ?
it would be hard to sell even 1 million yuan .
We have been taught a very serious lesson in the matters of leadership and work methods .
We cannot accomplish our tasks in any other field , for instance , .
In checking up on land distribution , or in economic construction , or culture and education , or our work in the new areas and the outlying districts , if all we do is to set the tasks without attending to the methods of carrying them out , without combating bureaucratic methods of work and adopting practical and concrete ones , and without discarding commandist methods and adopting the method of patient persuasion .
The comrades in Hsing @-@ kuo have done first @-@ rate work and deserve our praise as model workers .
The comrades in northeastern Kiangsi have done good work and are also model soviet workers .
By linking the problem of the well @-@ being of the masses with that of the revolution the comrades in both these places are simultaneously solving the problems of revolutionary methods of work and of accomplishing their revolutionary tasks .
They are working conscientously , solving problems with minute care and shouldering their revolutionary responsibilities in earnest .
They are good organizers and leaders of both
revolution and the well @-@ being pf the masses .
Elsewhere , too , the comrades have made progress in their work and deserve.pur praise ^ -as in some parts of the counties of Shang @-@ hang ?
Ch ? ang--t &apos;ing and Yung ^ -ting in Fukien Province , In Hsi @-@ chiang and other places in southern Kiangsi Province ; in some parts of the counties of Ch &apos;a @-@ ling , Yung @-@ hsin and Chi @-@ an in the Hunan @-@ Kiangsi burder area ; in some parts of Yang @-@ Hsin County in the Hunan @-@ Hupeh @-@ Kiangsi border area ; in districts and townships of many other counties in Kiangsi Province and in Jui @-@ chin County , which is directly under our Central Government , progress was made .
We should , however , point out that the work done by the Soviets of some areas is far from satisfactory .
And we should apply the spirit of self @-@ criticism to enhance our revolutionary vigilance with regard to the work of these areas .
For instance , there are many shortcomings in many places of the Fukien @-@ Kiangsi , Hupeh @-@ Kiangsi and Hunan @-@ Hupeh @-@ Kiangsi areas .
Similarly , Fukien and Hunan @-@ Kiangsi are a far cry from Kiangsi and Fukien- ^ Chekiang @-@ Kiangsi area , For example , the leaders of the Fukien Provincial Government are seriously afflicted with bureaucraticism .
Many of the cadres in these areas do not enjoy good relations with the masses- .
They still do not comprehend the need to link closely the revolution with the well @-@ being of the masses , to exert themselves in learning the arts of the masses and giving their leadership , They do .
not understand that without good methods of work , they absolutely will not be able to accomplish their tasks , that they should coordinate all work with the revolution war effort .
There should be a thorough change in the work of these areas after the conclusion of the Second All @-@ Soviet Congress .
Especially those seriously afflicted with opportunism and bureaucraticism do not understand the situation prevailing in the lower levels and the feelings of the massesf engaging only in idle talk and even resorting to commandism in handling the work of the Soviet .
The Congress should sternly censure these cadres , Their views and work methods are absolutely wrong .
They hinder the work of the Soviet and are not beneficial to the revolution .
These cadres should immediately change their ways .
In all the places under our leadership , there are undoubtedly many active cadres , excellent comrades , who have sprung from the masses .
These comrades have a responsibility .
That is to conduct a serious self--criticism campaign against those opportunists and bureaucrats , instruct and help them to rapidly rectify their errors , and cleanse the Soviet of those obdurate elements who refuse to change .
We are in the midst of a great revolutionary war .
We must break through the enemyTs large @-@ scale &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; and spread the revolution to all parts of the country .
All revolutionary cadres have a tremendous responsibility .
After this Congress we must adopt effective measures to improve our work , the advanced areas should become even more advanced , and the backward areas should catch up with the advanced .
We must create thousands of townships like Chrang @-@ kang and scores of counties like Hsing @-@ kuo .
They will be our advance strongholds .
From these strongholds , we shall sally forth to smash the enemy &apos;s &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaigns , overthrow the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang throughout the country and win victory for the revolution in all of China !
( loud applause )
The conclusion of the Central Executive Committee and the People &apos;s Committee report ends here .
As for the rest , I have brought them up in the report and will not repeat them .
My conclusion , is ended , ( thunderous applause )

1 February 1934
&#91; Text &#93; Comrades !
After 11 days of conference our Congress has been completely successful .
It has come to a victorious end !

Nationwide victory for the Revolution is in our hands !
( applause ) We must smash imperialisms and the Kuomintang &apos;s &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; We must overthrow imperialism and the Kuomintang .
We decided upon the policies and plans to achieve them !
( applause )
The current problem is to carry out these policies and plans 100 percent !
We must have the courage to act and act resolutely .
We must heighten the enthusiasm of all the cadres for their work , heighten the enthusiasm and ac @-@ r tivism of the broad masses .
Our responsibility is great .
We are shouldering the glorious burden of revolution placed upon us by the Congress .
We must shoulder this burden with enthusiasm , resoluteness and courage and march forward .
We certainly must shoulder this burden until we reach our destination !
( applause ) Smash the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; thoroughly , overthrow imperialism and the Kuomintang and strive to achieve nationwide victory for the Revolution !
Victory for the bourgeois democratic revolution throughout the country !
Victory for the workers @-@ peasant democratic dictatorship in all parts of Chiina !
These are our objectives and we must carry the burden handed to us by the Congress to these areas .
We will reach these areas , and reach them quickly !
( applause ) Is our mission accomplished after having reached these areas with the revolutionary burden ?
Is the worker @-@ peasant democratic dictatorship our final objective ?
Comrades !
No .
The mission is not yet accomplished , and that is not our final objective .
The revolutionary burden has to be carried to an even more distant place .
Today , we shall point out this place .
It is the Socialist Revolution under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat .
We have not only to accomplish the democratic revolution , but also bring about a change in the revolution and head it in the direction of socialism in the future !
We must not only overthrow the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang and wipe out the landlord class .
We must also prepare as of now for an opportune moment in the future to wipe out the capitalist system , the system of man exploiting man .
We must , as the Soviet Union is now doing , enter into communism in the final stage , putting into effect the system of &quot; from each according to his ability , to each according to his needs , &quot; and emerge into a free , bright and great world .
Only when such a time arrives can there be the final liberation of mankind ; Only then can there be a final victory of mankind !
The Second All @-@ Soviet Congress closes today .
We must carry out our responsibilities .
We must courageously shoulder the great responsibilities of the Revolution and march forward to realize our final victory !
Long Live the Soviet !
Long Live the Victory of the Revolution !
Long live nationwide victory for the Revolution !
Long live worldwide victory for the Revolution !
Long live Socialism !
Long live Communism !

DECLARATION ON THE FUKIEN INCIDENT
11 February 1934
&#91; Text &#93; Masses of all China !
The so @-@ called People &apos;s Revolutionary Government of Fukien , due to the armed intervention of Chiang Kai @-@ shek and the surrender and sellout by the leaders of the People &apos;s Revolutionary Government , is finally defeated .
The leaders of the Pukien People &apos;s Revolutionary Government were severely attacked last year at Lien @-@ ch &apos;eng and Min @-@ pei by our Workers and Peasants Red Army and Eastern Army , They now know that temporary concessions of the soviet and Red Army are the necessary condition for maintaining their available forces and rule .
At the same time , the bankruptcy of the traitorous and oppressive Kuomintang rule , the growing anger and resistance of the tens of millions of worker @-@ peasant masses to the imperialist Kuomintang and their sympathy and support for the anti @-@ imperialist , anti @-@ Kuomintang soviet Red Army gave the bureaucrats , politicians and militarists of the Fukien Kuomintang Provincial Government and 19th Route Army at that time no choice but to seek modes of rule besides those of the Kuomintang .
They came to preserve the entire rule of the landlord and bourgeois class .
At that time , the bureaucrats , politicians and militarists of the Fukien Provincial Government and 19th Route Army first sent a special envoy , Hsu Ming @-@ hung &#91; 1776 0682 7703 &#93; , to the soviet Central Government where he indicated he was willing to accept the three provisions of the soviet Central Government and Revolutionary Military Committee , that is , 1 ) immediate halt to attacks on soviet areas ; 2 ) immediate guarantee of freedoms and rights of the masses to speak , assemble , form associations and strike ; and 3 ) immediate establishment of a volunteer army of the armed masses to safeguard China and to strive for the independence , unification and territorial integrity of China .
The soviet government completely understood this scheme of the bureaucrats , politicians and militarists of the Pukien Kuomintang Provincial Government and 19th Route Army of that time .
All the empty words absolutely could not fool the leaders of the soviet government .
On the other hand , according to
its own declaration , the soviet government was willing to provide real impetus and support to all anti @-@ imperialist and anti @-@ Chiang plans .
The soviet government and Worker @-@ Peasants Red Army of that time , with the representatives of the Fukien Provincial Government and 19th Route Army permitted to accept all of our demands and conditions , and according to our own basic revolutionary position , drew up a preliminary agreement with them .
From the very beginning , the leaders of the soviet government told the representatives of the Fukien Provincial Government and 19th Route Army that only if they resolutely wage and back the anti @-@ Japanese , anti @-@ imperialist , anti @-@ Chiang revolutionary struggle of the broad masses , arm them and give them all the democratic freedoms and rights , can they save the Chinese nation from perishing .
Any reformist deceptive propaganda can only serve as an additional tool for the imperialist Kuomtntang .
After the representatives of the Fukien Provincial Government and 19th Route Army drew up the preliminary agreement with the soviet government and Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army , they stated that they would separate from the Kuomintang , announced some &quot; left &quot; reformist political programs and openly published declarations opposing Chiang Kai @-@ shek of the Nanking Kuomintang Government .
This was just lip service .
In reality , they still colluded with the Japanese and American imperialists as before and toadied to them .
They kept silent and did not make a sound about the provocations of the Japanese ronin in Foochow .
In respect to allowing democratic rights for the masses and arming the masses , on the pretext that it was wartime , they did not make good on any of their promises .
As for the workers , peasants and all toilers , not only did they not have any concrete methods to improve their life but on the contrary , they made every effort to prohibit the workers &apos; struggle to strike and the peasantsT struggle to resist the landlords and seize land .
Militarily , they completely took the defeatist line .
Faced with Chiang Kai @-@ shek * s relentless attacks , first of all they offered no concrete military deployment whatsoever and then they surrendered and sold out again and again , from the direct mutiny of Ssu @-@ t ? u Fei &#91; 0674 1778 7236 &#93; and T &apos;an Ch &apos;i @-@ hsiu &#91; 6223 0796 4423 &#93; to Shen Kuang @-@ han &#91; 3098 0342 3352 &#93; , Mao Wei @-@ shou &#91; 3029 4850 1108 &#93; , Ou Shou @-@ nien &#91; 0575 1108 1628 &#93; and Chang Yen &#91; 1728 3508 &#93; , The militarists of the 19th Route Army , the likes of Chiang Kuang @-@ ting &#91; 5592 0342 7844 &#93; and Ts &apos;ai T &apos;ing ^ chieh &#91; 5591 1694 6946 &#93; , retreated without a fight and surrendered the Kwangtung militarists to save themselves .
Many other bureaucrats and politicians , the likes of Ch &apos;en Ming @-@ shu &#91; 7115 6900 2873 &#93; , Ch &apos;en Yu @-@ jen &#91; 7115 0645 0088 &#93; and Huang Ch &apos;i @-@ hsiang &#91; 7806 3825 5046 &#93; , spent all day in empty talk and deceiving the masses .
As soon as they heard a shot they flew away as chickens , scattered as dogs and fled for their lives to imperialist legations and warships .
Although our Red Army had already taken positive action in MiriT @-@ pei and occupied Sha @-@ hsien to Yu @-@ ch &apos;i in order to coordinate their anti @-@ Chiang struggle , it was still of no help to those packs of jackals .
The soviet government and the Worker and Peasant Red Army had already warned the People &apos;s Revolutionary Government again according to the preliminary agreement that only by realizing every provision of the agreement and
launching the revolutionary struggle of the broad masses could they defeat the armed attacks of Chiang Kai @-@ shek and go right on to oppose the Japanese imperialists .
The warning of the soviet government and Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army could not get the attention of the bureaucrats , politicians and militarists in the People &apos;s Revolutionary Government .
They looked on the masses as enemies and they did not have the slightest difference from other Kuomintang bureaucrats , politicians and militarists .
As a result , just as we said , the People &apos;s Revolutionary Government , faced with Chiang Kai @-@ shek , concluded its sad fate of over 50 days .
Masses of all China !
You can see fully from the preliminary agreement drawn up by the soviet government.and the People &apos;s Revolutionary Government and from the soviet government &apos;s delegram how the soviet government and the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army are unwavering in the struggle to oppose Japanese imperialism and its lackey Chiang Kai @-@ shek and for the thorough liberation of the Chinese nation .
All the facts prove that only the soviet government and the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army are the anti @-@ imperialist vanguard that can liberate China from the iron heel of the imperialist Kuomintang .
All the reformist factions , from the Productive Masses Party , Social Democratic Party and Third Party , right down to the Trotskyite Ch &apos;en Tu @-@ hsiu &#91; 7115 3747 4423 &#93; liquidationists were all nothing but yes @-@ men to the imperialist Kuomintang and accomplices with the imperialist Kuomintang in opposing the Chinese revolutionary masses !
The soviet Central Government and the Revolutionary Military Committee declare once more to the masses of all China , revolutionary soldiers and all armed ranks , that just because of the defeat of the Fukien People &apos;s Revolutionary Government or the breaking of the agreement by the bureaucrats , politicians and militarists in the People &apos;s Revolutionary Government , the soviet government absolutely will not forsake &#91; two characters deleted &#93; the proposals of the battle agreement drawn up and fought for under the three conditions of the past .
On the contrary , through the Fukien incident , every worker , every peasant , every soldier , every intellectual and anti @-@ Japanese Chinese can see even more clearly that the soviet government , not in lip service but in actual deed , is willing to unite with all the armed forces which can truly resist Japn and oppose Chiang and strive for the independence , freedom and liberation of the Chinese nation .
All those who can truly resist Japan and oppose Chiang as well as all anti @-@ imperialist and anti ^ Kuomintang forces can obtain strong guidance and support from the soviet government and Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army but the soviet government and the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army will continue to attack and expose mercilessly all counterrevolutionary reformist factions which attempt to preserve imperialism and the Chinese landlord and bourgeois rule with empty promises and deceptive propaganda .
Masses of all China !
The disastrous history of the Fukien People &apos;s Revolutionary Government pointed out again that only with your own brave , resolute struggle can you finally overthrow the rule of the imperialist Kuomintang and assure China &apos;s independence , freedom and territorial integrity .
The victorious and successful experience of tens of millions of workers in the vast soviet areas of China tells you that only the soviet road can attain the national and social liberation of the masses nationwide !
If you oppose the attacks of the imperialist Kuomintang against the soviet areas and safeguard the Chinese soviet , you are safeguarding the Chinese revolution and assuring your own victory !
Anti @-@ Japanese and anti @-@ imperialist forces of all China unite !
Smash the five &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; of the imperialist Kuomintang !
Down with Japanese and all imperialism !
Down with the traitorous Nanking Kuomintang Government and all Kuomintang governments !
Long live anti @-@ imperialist soviet China !

JUDICIAL PROCEDURE 8 April 1934
&#91; Text &#93; By Order of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Soviet Republic No 5
This is a proclamation of the promulgated judicial procedure of the Chinese Soviet Republic , 8 April 1934
Mao Tse @-@ tung , chairman
Hsiang Ying , Chang Kuo @-@ t &apos;ao , vice chairmen
In the situation of a civil war , the soviet courts , political security bureaus , committee for the suppression of counterrevolutionaries and other organs should adopt speedily resolute and correct methods to suppress counterrevolutionaries and guarantee the victory of the revolutionary people , and consolidate the soviet regime .
The following judicial procedures have , therefore , been specially set forth :
The special agent of the area Security Bureau , the area Procurator &apos;s Court , the area Committee for the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries ( .that is under the Revolutionary Committee of the new soviet areas ) , the People &apos;s Police , Labor courts all have the authority to arrest counterrevolutionaries and others who should be apprehended .
The law prohibiting the area from arresting a person without permission from higher levels should be abolished , and it is also set forth that when there is an emergency , the township and city Soviets and the rural and urban revolutionary committees have the authority to arrest counterrevolutionaries and other important criminals provided they have received the support of the local revolutionary masses .
After apprehension they are to be handed over to counterrevolutionary suppression organizations of the area level .
The Procurator &apos;s Court and the Committee for the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries of the soviet area have the authority to bring to trial and sentence all local criminals ( counterrevolutionaries and others as well ) .
At times of emergency mobilisations ( such as the land inspection movement , the expansion of the Red Army and launching surprise attacks ) , the Procurator Department of the area , the area Committee for the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries , with the support of the revolutionary people , have the right to apprehend criminals such as gentry and landlords in the new border areas , areas where the enemy is carrying out its offensives and , in areas where counterrevolution is especially active , have them executed immediately after they have been tried .
After the sentence has been carried out , however , it must be reported to higher echelons for handling .
The procurator departments of the county and provincial levels , the Committee for the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries , the preliminary level and higher courts of the military all have the authority to apprehend , bring to trial and sentence , as well as carrying out the sentencing ( including the death sentence ) of all criminals .
The state &apos;s bureaus of political security at various levels have the authority to pre ^ -try all cases concerning counterrevolution .
They are to be handed over to the courts for handling afterward .
The security bureaus of the border areas and of the Red Army on the fronts have the authority to take direct action against enemy spying , against fascist imperialists , armed groups of bandits and counterrevolutionary landlords and gentry without going through the courts .
Emergency action may be taken by the State Political Security Bureau and its local bureaus , the branch bureau of the Red Army and the military zone in serious and urgent cases of counterrevolution .
If disputes arise between the local government and military and political leaders or other organizations after action was taken , the decision to decide the correctness or error of the action rests with the People &apos;s Committee and with the provincial presidium in areas which are not connected with the Central Soviet area .
The system of approval from higher levels is abolished and the system of reporting to higher echelons will be carried out instead .
Criminals are permitted to appeal if they are not satisfied with the sentence meted out .
The .
period of appeal available will be 7 days at a -maximum , beginning from the day the document of judgment is handed over to the defendant ( verbal explanations must be given to illiterates ) .
In areas under enemy attack and under other emergency situations , the right to appeal may be refused in cases of counterrevolution , or landlords and gentry who have committed crimes .
It is hereby resolved that the soviet courts will function on a two @-@ level system of preliminary hearings and final trials .
If preliminary hearings are held by the area , the county will carry out the final trial .
When the county is the one that carries out the preliminary hearings , the final trial will be held at the provincial level .
If the military courts happen to be the organs holding the preliminary hearings , then the final trial will be held by the Supreme Court .
In the structure of trial functions the Supreme
Court is the final organization .
All cases cannot be appealed after proceeding through these two trials and sentence passed .
But , should the procurator feel that there are points of disagreements after going through the two trials , he can protest against a judicial organization and have the case retried .
Except for those organizations so named in this functional system , no other organizations will have the authority to apprehend , bring to trial and pass judgment on any criminals .
Only emergency situations are the
exceptions .
The judicial procedures set forth in the provisional procedures of military courts published on 1 February 1932 , the provisional trial procedures and organizations of courts , published on 9 June 1932 and Ordinance No 6 proclaimed by the Central Executive Committee on 16 December 1931 are herewith rescinded .

HOW DO TOWNSHIP SOVIET GOVERNMENTS WORK ?
10 April 1934
&#91; Text &#93; The basic organizations of the Soviet Government are the township and municipal Soviets and they are the levels closest to the people .
They are the agencies which directly lead the people in carrying out the various tasks of
the Soviet .
In a Civil War , the work of mobilizing for war is very urgent and the livelihood of the masses needs to be improved .
It is of primary importance to go all out to improve the work at township and municipal Soviets , strengthen the organization and leadership of these Soviets so that they will be completely suitable for developing the revolution and improving the livelihood of the people .
The orientation of the work to improve the functions of township and municipal Soviets should be directed at being most capable of contacting the masses , rousing the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses , mobilizing them to carry out the tasks of the Soviets and expediting the accomplishment of these tasks so that there will be complete coordination between the work of the Soviet , the revolution and the well @-@ being of the masses .
This is the principle on which the work of the Soviet is based .
There are already many township soyiets in our areas which are capable of meeting these basic requirements and they have created many good organizational structures and work methods , There , are , however , many other townships which contravene these requirements in their work or have not completely complied with these requirements .
It is urgently necessary to clearly and concretely set forth regulations in the work of the township Soviets based upon these requirements so that each township soviet functionary will have a uniform standard to work by .
How shall the township Soviets carry out their work ?
They should be in accordance with the following regulations .
The Work of the Township Soviet Presidium
The presidium of a township should constitute seven members if large and five if small .
These are people elected by the Congress , only those who are most activist and capable should be elected .
The presidium is the supreme political organ , of the entire township after the ending of the Congress .
It should resolutely implement the resolutions and instructions of Congress and higher level Soviets , and directly lead the work of the entire township .
The presidium should know how to grasp the central task at each period and bring these tasks up for discussion at the Congress .
It should not busy itself with various minor matters and neglect the central task .
Meetings of the presidium must be well conducted , and the work of the standing members must be carried out with urgency and thoroughness .
There should be no phenomenon of laxness and laziness and commandism rnust be completely done away with .
The presidium must understand the situation of each village , the characteristics of each village and they must give their attention to the difficulties of the masses in each village and , in accordance with the actual situation prevailing in each village and its special characteristics , impel the work in order to resolve the difficult problems of the masses ,
For rapid improvement in the work of each village , attention must be given to motivating the work of the chairman and vice chairman , the representative meetings of each village , the mass meetings , and the small group meetings under the leadership of each member so that they all will be held promptly as scheduled and conducted properly .
The presidium must give attention to keeping the entire body of representatives , the various committees and the various mass organizations united and rally them around itself , motivating them to mobilizing the people of the entire township to carry out various tasks , They should not become separated with the mass organizations , the representatives and the committees and leave only a few to do the job .
The leadership of the representatives meeting must be given careful
attention , and the &apos; residium must have proper preparations made before they are held .
The presidium should -meet every &apos; 5 days .
That is , the presidium must meet twice before and after the representatives meeting in the in @-@ between periods , and the chairman of the township may be asked to attend .
On the question of problems to be discussed at the meeting , at first it will mainly be discussions on how to inspire the chairmen and vice chairmen of the various villages as well as comrades of the Congress how to implement the work given to them earlier and carrying out the resolutions of the earlier Congress , and this meeting is best held 2 or 3 days after the next Congress .
The meeting of the presidium has also had to contend with minor matters .
Do not bring these trivial -matters up for discussion at the next Congress ,
The meeting of the presidium should best be held after supper and should not last longer than 2 hours .
The presidium should have a system of division of labor and work should be assigned to those members who are not on the standing committee to spur the people of certain villages in carrying out certain types of work .
The chairman of the presidium should naturally direct the work of the entire township , be the chairman of the presidium when it is in meeting , attend meetings convened by higher levels and manage daily routines .
He should grasp the central tasks assigned by higher echelon at certain periods of time ( such as the expansion of the Red Army , the land inspection movement , elections , road construction , collecting land taxes , selling bonds , development of cooperatives and spring cultivation movement , etc . ) .
He should pay attention to routine work ( such as the training of Red Youth Units , Red Martial Law , food grains , education , public health and preferential treatment of members of Red Army families ) .
He should also be careful of special situations arising in his own village ( such as famine , plague epidemics , floods arid counterrevolutionary activities , etc . ) .
He should constantly think about these problems and tasks , how such work should be done in the villages , which village is falling behind in its work and should be prodded and aid given .
He should divide the paper work with his vice chairman and also have a division of labor in attending the meetings of the various villages and gathering good experiences gained in each piece of work done in a village and the poor performance observed .
These are to be presented at the meeting of the presidium or reported at the meeting of Congress contributing material for the Congress to discuss ( when that problem is on discussion ) .
Attending the meetings of the various mass meetings held by the villages , by various mass organizations and committees should also be delegated by the chairman of the presidium .
The vice chairman should share the paper work with the chairman , attending the meetings of the various villages , and assign to himself the work of one or two villages .
He must be thoroughly capable of motivating and collecting materials and return to make a report .
He is also required to understand the work of the entire township so that when the chairman is absent he can work on behalf of the chairman .
A permanent vice chairman must help the chairman with the daily routine and also frequently attend the meetings of the various committees and mass organisations .
The paper work consists of processing census and land ledgers , registration of marriages , births and deaths , various investigation reports , writing up reports to the area soviet , allocating transportation labor , sending notices to various villages , writing up travel permits , helping members of Red Army families write letters , reading documents from higher levels to those chairmen and vice chairmen who are illiterate , underscore the important parts when reading documents at presidium and congress meetings , keep minutes of the meetings , and remind the chairman and vice chairmen on those areas where they have neglected to give their attention .
The secretary should also attend the meetings of the presidiums and mass organizations and if he is a representative he should participate in the presidium .
The examination and education of representatives should be matter the presidium should give its attention to .
Among the representatives , there will be some who are activists in their work and some who are apathetic and go slow .
The model work of the activists should be set forth as models for those workers with pessimistic outlooks .
These pessimists must be criticized .
Some should be named in the representative meetings so as to rouse the others to struggle against them .
Educate the entire body of representatives in this manner , so as to transform the pessimists into activists .
There are some to whom being elected representatives is their first experience and do not know how to go about their work .
They must be taught carefully how the work is to be done .
Those who have often undergone education through criticism and struggle and still do not show any change or progress ( such as after 1 or 2 months being unable to accomplish the tasks given them , or even deliberately staying away from meetings 5 or 6 consecutive times ) should he brought to the attention of the Congress and resolution passed to expel them and substituting alternate members .
It would be incorrect not to expel such worthless members and have them replaced .
After reassignment of a representative engaged in certain work , he should also be &apos;immediately replaced .
Investigations should also be made to see whether landlord , rich peasant and counterrevolutionary elements fraudulently pose as representatives to sabotage our Soviet .
They should be immediately expelled .
It is even more necessary to apprehend and punish counterrevolutionaries .
Inspectors at sentry points and transportation of the township soviet may be selected from the three methods defined as follows : Appoint someone permanently to the post .
He will have to rely on his own rations , but will be exempt from various duties .
Also , dispatch people to help with the family &apos;s farming .
Or dispatch personnel from the Young Pioneer units on a .
rotational basis .
They will be notified the evening of the previous day to take up their work the next morning .
They shall return home to eat their meals , but no help will be dispatched to assist with the farming .
Or , send one person to stay permanently on site with the residents providing the meals through monetary contributions .
Each area will decide on their own which method to select .
The first method will be the best .
Young comrades should be selected in all cases for the post of transportation and sentry point personnel .
These people must be highly intelligent and should be literate .
They should be given training in their work .
B , The Functions of the Congress
The township congress is the highest organ of political power in the township .
Leadership of Congress is of extreme importance because from the discussions held in Congress emerge the implementation of all laws and policies of the Soviet and the accomplishment of various tasks of the Soviet .
Generally , congresses are held every 10 days .
It should be held in the evening when farm work is busy .
The duration of the meeting should be 2 hours at the most , and not to exceed 3 hours .
Each meeting should be divided into the period for reporting and the period for discussions .
The chairman and participants from the area Soviet will each make a 10 @-@ minute report .
If there are too many , it should be brought up during the period of discussion .
In discussions about work done in their own villages , after the village chairman makes his report for several minutes , if there are many points to be reported they may be taken up during the period for discussions .
In special work investigative meetings more time should be given to the various village chairmen to make their reports .
The reports must contain factual materials and proposals .
Reports made up of empty talk will be abolished .
Each Congress will have but one principal matter for discussion .
There may be one or two problems of secondary importance .
A greater part of the meeting should be devoted to the discussion of the major problem , and less time given to the secondary problems .
If several problems of great Importance are brought up for discussion every time then the meeting will wind up without any results .
Discussions of problems must be on a practical basis .
For instance , a discussion o spring cultivation should include such subjects as &apos; &apos; the development of labor mutual help cooperatives , &quot; &quot; development of plow oxen cooperatives , &quot; &quot; how the Hand cultivation troop should give preferential treatment to the families of Red Army members , &quot; &quot; increasing fertilizers , &apos; 1&apos; &apos; &quot; more plowing and more raking , &quot; &quot; reclaim wasteland and mountains , &quot; &quot; repair embankments , ponds and water @-@ wheels , &quot; &quot; planting of cotton , &quot; &quot; planting more or less glutinous rice , &quot; &quot; planting more vegetables &quot; and others .
These discussions must be based on the actual situation prevailing in the villages .
Precise methods must be set forth for each item discussed .
For example , on &quot; developing the labor cooperatives , &quot; estimates must be made on how many more people can be expanded in the entire township now , set a total figure and , in accordance with the actual situation of the villages , set forth how many more people should each village include .
Then , this task should be handed over to the chairmen and vice chairmen of the villages to take back with them .
In accordance with the number of residents under the jurisdiction , each representative makes actual allocations .
And a period for the task to be accomplished must also be set .
In discussions , each item must be taken separately .
Proceed to the second item after the first item has been discussed and concluded , with the conclusions of these discussions deemed to be resolutions and recorded in the registry , to facilitate inspection during the .
next meeting and so that the presidium will be able to spur the people .
Incompleted discussions will be continued at the next meeting .
At the second spring farming meeting , the resolutions made at the earlier meeting should be examined .
When examining a certain item , the various chairmen of the villages should report the actual situation , the reasons for
completing or not completing certain tasks ; with the main idea of searching out experiences and lessons for the .
various representatives to study .
After such an examination , continue with the discussions of new problems of the spring plowing .
Criticism should be made in the light of the circumstances of those representatives and village chairmen who were discovered not to have completed their tasks so as to alert them .
In the discussion of other matters this example should be followed .
Many of the township representatives &apos; meetings are not thorough in their discussions of problems and neglect to shift out the minor items from the bigger problems , or make a general discussion of all the problems without going through them one by one .
This causes people to return from these meetings without any clear @-@ cut understanding of the resolutions made , At these meetings , discussions are made without any regard to the actual situation and characteristics of the various villages .
Nor are quotas set for each village ( this is with regard to those cases where quantity has to be set ) .
Regulations were not set forth when the task was to be completed .
Village chairmen were not charged with assigning definite tasks to the various representatives when they returned to their villages , to see to it that they were completed and encouraging them to do so .
In setting tasks for certain villages with particular characteristics ( for example , requiring certain village to dig ponds ) , they will not make it a special point to ask the representatives of a certain village &apos; &apos; Do you think it is right to regulate it so ? &quot; But they pass this as a general resolution .
Resolutions were discussed by only certain township Soviets- , In many meetings , these resolutions were not brought forth for examination .
Even when examined , the reasons for success or failure of each household or village were not settled .
Nor were those representatives and -village chairmen who were dragging their feet criticized .
What is the use of such examinations and discussions , then ?
They are empty of substance , bureaucratic and a waste of time that cannot accomplish the mission of the Soviet .
Taking an attitude of peace toward those pessimists and feet @-@ draggers will cause the Congress to lose its vitality .
It will be unable to encourage those representatives Of backward families and villages to lead the masses and work hard to reach the level of advanced families and villages .
This is wrong .
For a Congress to be successful , preparations made by the presidium must be good .
What was said before about the presidium requiring to hold a meeting before the representative meeting and make.careful preparations on the reports and problems to be presented at the next meeting is indispensable .
The preparation work is the special responsibility of the chairman and the vice chairman and secretary must assist him .
In many instances , chairmen presiding over the meetings were elected on the spur of the moment .
In some areas it is incorrectly regulated that -members of the presidium should not be elected .
The presiding chairman should be the permanently assigned functionary .
The chairman of the township soviet would be best , because only he is knowledgeable about the entire township .
A roll call shall be made at every representative meeting .
Those who are absent shall be so marked on the name list .
The presidium should have a list of the representatives , names , s.ex , age and class . &apos; element , in accordance with each household and village .
The Structure and Function of the Village
The village is the core of the work of the township .
The presidium of the township soviet should give its entire attention to the organization and leadership of the village .
It is imperative that all townships which have not delimited villages should do so .
Some townships may be delimited to two and some to three villages , while other big townships may divide into four or five villages.-This delimiting shall be based upon actual situation .
Generally , in dividing the area into villages , the smaller they are the better they will be , because big areas cannot be easily directed .
The village shall have one chairman and one vice chairman , who will be elected at the representatives meeting of the township .
Electees should be the most capable and most activist of the representatives .
In a village with only a few families ( a small village ) , the chairman and vice chairman should not be from the same family .
The village chairman has the responsibility to oversee the work of the entire village and the vice chairman is to help him .
( Note : ) In cases of chairmen and vice chairmen who have an inadequate labor force in their families , the township soviet may designate aid be given them by the masses during the busy farming season in the form of pro-.rated labor in order to make up for their time spent ( more than the other representatives ) in their endeavors to accomplish the tasks of the Soviet .
Should the people agree , full preferential treatment may be given the village chairman so that he can devote his entire time to the tasks and seek benefits for the masses of the entire village .
Generally , the village chairman will hold a meeting of all of the represen ^ tatives every 10 days ( for instance , if there are 15 representatives in the village , these 15 will be called to the meeting ) .
When work is busy these meetings may be called every 5 days .
Iti examining the work of the representatives , discuss how to accomplish the tasks given to the village by the township congress in accordance with the characteristics of each family or household .
Resolve minor disputes and problems of mutual help among the village residents , prepare reports for the mass meetings to be held by the village and give impetus to the work of the village committee .
Village representatives meeting of this kind should be scheduled by the township Soviet &apos;s presidium .
It is best to schedule meetings to be held between the two representatives meetings , but closer to the latter .
For
example , there are three villages In a certain township and the township representatives meetings are to be held on the 5th and the 15th .
The schedule can be set for the first village to hold its meeting on the eleventh , the second on the twelfth and the third on the thirteenth .
Then , standing committee members , especially the chairman , of the township soviet will be able to attend these village meetings .
If the meeting is to be held once every 5 days , then they can be scheduled to be held once several days after the first township soviet meeting and once several days before the next repre ^ -sentative meeting of the township soviet .
These meetings are mainly for examining and directing.work , and for the village chairman to make this report on the results of the examinations at the next township congress ,
Set up a system of a division of labor among the representatives in giving leadership to the masses .
For instance , a certain village has 15 repre ^ sentatives and 500 residents .
Divide these 500 people into 15 divisions in accordance with the distances of the representatives1 residences to them and assign one representative over the people of one division .
This should not be done by averaging , but should be in accordance with the locations of the households , the strength and weaknesses of the representative and by assigning to them a suitable number of people .
There can be as many as 50 to 60 to a representative , and as few as 30 or 40 .
This method of dividing work among the representatives will place responsibilities on all of the representatives .
Each representative shall , in clearly distinguished spheres , lead the masses in the work of the Soviet ( such as supervising the score or so people working under him in spring farming , propagandizing a dozen or so of the activis @-@ ts among his group to join the Red Army , participating in cooperatives , supervising children in the day schools , encouraging adults to attend night schools , encouraging each family to sweep their houses and clean their sewers to maintain hygiene ?
taking a dozen or so people to hold mass meetings , heep surveillance on the activities of landlords and rich peasants , etc . ) .
He should solicit the ideas of the masses and speedily Bring them to the attention of the village and township representatives &apos; meetings , speedily resolve difficulties and problems of the masses .
To date , however , there are some areas where such a system of division of labor among the representatives has- not been implemented .
This system should be put into effect immediately .
( Note : ) The village chairman should have a ledger in which the population of the village , the area of land available in the village , the number of Red youth troops , the quantity of food grains ( the total quantity available , how many families have surpluses and how many are deficient ) and other necessary items .
Each representative should also have a list of names of the people under their jurisdictions .
Each of the representatives must call meetings of those dozen or so people under their jurisdiction , examine the situation of the Soviet work done by each family , discuss the &apos;work currently to be done , report articles of competition , the township Soviet &apos;s resolutions , collect proposals from the people and report them at the village or township congresses .
Such meetings
will take the form of informal talks with the representative as the chairman of the meeting .
One hour will be enough time fpr the meeting and it should be held when everybody has leisure to do so .
Such meetings should be scheduled once every 10 days , and the units under the jurisdiction of the representataves of the entire village may also hold their meetings on the same day .
Should a representative group by unable to hold the meeting with due cause they should be made responsible to hold it on another day .
The chairman of the township soviet convened the chairmen of the various villages and make up a schedule so that there will be no conflicts between village , township and other meetings .
When this type of meeting is held , the masses should be directed to launch criticisms of each other .
For instance , is a family receiving a deserter and refusing to return him to his unit , or is a certain family failing to put Its best efforts in the spring plowing , or is a household apathetic toward helping families of Red Army members cultivate their lands ?
If a family is neglecting its aged members , neglecting to encourage its children in their studies and not maintaining a hygienic standard.they should be criticized .
Soviet resolutions can be very rapidly spread to the masses through such meetings , accelerating the work of the Soviet , rapidly improving the well @-@ being of the people and heightening the fervor of the spirit of mass struggles .
Besides attending such meetings , each representative must make time to visit individual households under his jurisdiction to check on whether they have any problems that require resolving , whether they have carried out the resolutions of the Soviet .
The first of these visits should be made on families of Red Army members and on the poorest people in the village .
Visits should also be paid to households of landlords and rich peasants in order to observe whether they are committing anything improper .
The small unit meetings and household visits of representatives should be directed by the ^ village chairman who will have that responsibility .
From these observations the quality of the work of the representative can be evaluated .
The mass meeting of the village has the highest potential to educate the masses , mobilize them to carry out the tasks of the Soviet and enhance the spirit of struggle among them .
It should be regarded as an important method to mobilize and educate the masses .
In many places not much attention is given to convening such mass meetings and this is incorrect .
In such village mass meetings , reports are made on resolutions passed by the township soviet , the revolutionary competition that is being carried out between villages ahd households and explaining the revolutionary tasks set forth by higher level Soviets so that after the masses have completely understood them these tasks could be carried out with all @-@ out effort .
A bi @-@ monthly schedule should be set for such mass meetings by the township soviet for the various villages and notifying the village chairman .
Do not
let these meetings conflict with others .
So that the township soviet will be able to .
dispa.tch personnel to participate , do not hold these village mass meetings on the same day .
In villages where the populace is concentrated in one household , the entire village will be considered as one unit in holding such meetings , and the village chairman will preside .
The majority of the villages in the soviet areas , however , have two or more households , and the meetings should be divided into two divisions so that everybody , men , women , old and young can attend .
The village chairman and the vice chairman will each preside over one of the meetings .
There should be proper .preparations made before holding such meetings .
How to aid the various representatives to get the majority of the masses to attend the mass meetings , what to report at these meetings and how to lead the masses to voice their opinionsthese must be discussed and agreed upon at the village congress .
These mass meetings should not exceed 2 hours , and they must be held when the majority of the masses have nothing else to do .
Mass meetings at the township level should not be held for good cause , such as memorial days or festival days .
The work of mobilizing the masses and educating them must be done mainly through utilizing the -mass meetings of the small unit type under the jurisdiction of the representative or the village
mass meetings .
The Committees of the Villages and the Township
Below the township , soviet committees administrating various special tasks to aid the township soviet should be organized .
Activists among the masses should join the committees as members and each representative of the township soviet should participate in one or two committees and play a leadership role in them .
The committee system must be regarded as one of the principal means to maintain liaison with the masses and propel forward the work of the Soviet .
Make haste to organize such committees in those areas where there are none .
Some committees are constantly being organized , such as those for the expansion of the Red Army , for giving preferential treatment and comfort to the Red Army , for maintaining alerts , for defense against air attacks and poisons , for agricultural production ( such as spring and summer cultivation , fall harvesting and winter plowing ) , for education in production , for forestry and water conservancy , for investigation and registration , for education , for health , for roads and bridges , for food grains , for State properties ( in townships where there are State properties ) and for worker @-@ peasant surveillance .
All these committees always have work to do .
Some of the committees are organized for temporary purposes , such as land inspection , confiscation and levies , land tax collections , selling bonds , land reclamation and elections .
These committees are temporary in nature , and they are no longer required after the work has been done .
The next time such work has to be done , these committees are again organized .
The
committees for land inspection , confiscation and levies are also no longer required after the land problem has been thqroughly resolved ,
Some committees should only be at township level .
Others ( such as committees for the expansion of the Red Army , for the preferential treatment of the lied Army , for education in production , for spring cultivation , for forestry and water conservancy , for education and health ) need to expand into the villages .
Only when the villages have such committees can the tasks be easily popularized and intensified .
In accordance with the nature of the committee , the personnel could range from as few as five to as many as seven or nine persons- Do not overstaff .
As for committees which exist at both village and township levels ( such as the spring cultivation committee ) five members will be enough for each of the village and township committees , while the chairman of the village committee is permitted to be a member of the township committee .
At the township level , the chairman and members of the committees should be elected at the township congress after the presidium has prepared a list and presented it .
At the village level , the village chairman will prepare a list and have it passed at the village congress .
The most activist comrade must be found to head the committee , and the presidium must educate the various chairmen how to carry out the work and supervise them to convene their own meetings OB schedule and inspect their work .
Chairmen who dragged their feet must be impeached and replaced with a new chairman .
Preparations must be made beforehand by the chairman when holding his own meeting , ensuring that every meeting will achieve results .
After the meeting , each committee member must be assigned a task and told how to accomplish it .
At the next meeting they must be made to report on the task performed .
Committee members who drag their feet will be dismissed and others will replace them .
A new election of the committees should be held usually every 6 months .
In these elections retain the activists and eliminate the feet draggers .
There should be a division of labor within the presidium of the township soviet so that the members will be able to participate in the meetings of the various committees at the township level .
The best means of doing this is for each member of the presidium to have several committees under his jurisdiction .
For example , the chairman will have jurisdiction over the committees for military affairs and finances ( such as the committees for expanding the Red Army , for giving comfort to the Red Army , for the Red military alert , for defense against air attacks and poisons , for collecting land taxes , for selling bonds , for the confiscation of land and levying and the protection of State properties , etc . ) .
The vice chairman will have jurisdiction over economic matters ( such as committees for the preferential
treatment of Red Army , spring cultivation , forestry , water conservancy , food grains , roads and bridges and education in production , etc . ) .
The secretary may take over other areas of responsibilities ( .education , health ?
worker @-@ peasant inspection , investigation and registration , etc . ) .
At the presidium meeting it will be resolved what duties each would be assigned and materials for the meetings collected so that the reports may be made at the meeting .
When , committee meetings are held , the township committee chairmen must attend the meetings of the committees under their jurisdictions ( such as the chairman of the township educational committee attending the village committee meeting on education ) .
The chairman and vice chairman of the village committee should also make a division of labor and take part .
The schedules of the meetings of the various committees of the townships and the villages should be set tip by the township presidium in accordance with the priorities of the work to be done at different periods , such as more meetings of the spring farming committee should be held in the spring time , but when winter comes , the winter plowing committee could slacken their schedule of meetings .
Each @-@ meeting should not last more than 2 1 / 2 hours .
The Liaison Between the Township Soviet and the Mass Organizations
More attention and aid should be given to the various mass organizations of the township ( such as the trade unions , poor peasants groups , women workers and peasants congress , the anti @-@ imperialist alliance to support the Soviet , mutual help associations , youth groups , labor mutual help cooperatives , plow cooperatives and various types of cooperatives such as the consumers co @-@ ops , production co @-@ ops , food co @-@ ops and credit unions , baby @-@ care centers , the association to eliminate illiteracy , the committee for the movement to gain literacy and clubs , etc . ) rely on their efforts to mobilize the broad masses to complete the various revolutionary tasks .
The township soviet has full responsibilities for those organizations which have no higher levels , such as the poor peasant groups , the women worker @-@ peasant congress , labor mutual help associations , plow @-@ oxen cooperatives and child @-@ care centers .
It must inspect their work periodically and provide them with full leadership .
Should it find errors in the work of these organizations , discussion should be held speedily and the errors corrected .
The township soviet has the responsibility to help them resolve difficulties regardless of the nature of the organizations .
The responsible person for the organization whose work is being discussed by the township soviet and the representatives meeting should be invited to attend the meeting and when meetings are being held by these organizations , the township soviet should also dispatch personnel to participate .
This holds true with regard to the village congress and village mass organizations .
Consultations should be held by the township Soviet &apos;s presidium with the responsible persons of the various mass organizations when schedules of meetings are being worked out so that there will be no conflicts of meetings at the village and township levels .
The township soviet must give its attention to giving leadership to the Red Guards and the Young Pioneer units so that all young men and women and adults will be participating in these town units .
The majority of them must be made to participate in village and township trainings so that there will be progress daily .
Dispatch personnel to participate in their cadres &apos; meet ing .
Revolutionary Competition and Commando Units
In order to attain quality and speed in the work of the Soviet so that it will be done well and with speed , the method or revolutionary competition and the organization of commando units should be put into effect in every township and village .
Regardless of whether it originated from higher levels or launched by the village themselves , revolutionary competition must first be discussed at the township congress and reported at the meetings of the people at village levels and at small units level .
When it concerns a certain mass.organization it must also be reported at the meeting of that organization , so that there will be clear understanding and acceptance by each and every one of the representatives and the people .
Only by having every one understand and accept it can they be made to shoulder their responsibilities and ignite their revolutionary zeal and put their efforts into the work , thereby carrying out the work in a fast and better manner and completing the work as required by the competition or even ahead of schedule .
All -methods of commandism and coercion must be abolished in this regard .
The competition of each item of work is not ended by merely discussing and reporting about it .
A very close inspection must also be carried out .
Each representative examines each household , the chairman and vice chairman of the villages examine the representatives .
The presidium of the township soviet and the Congress will examine the chairmen and vice chairmen of the villages .
If such examinations are not carried out some person , representative , village household , will do the work haphazardly and will not be able tq complete the work assigned as scheduled , or even though they meet the quota the quality will be poor .
The system of examination is a very important method to achieve speed and quality in the work of the soviet .
Decisions without examinations is but a bureaucratic way of leadership , and it is as harmful as coercion .
In each of these competition events discussions shall be made at the village and township congress when the period set is over , distinctions will be made between the superior and the inferior performers , the superior performance will be rewarded while the inferior one will be criticized .
A commando unit consisting of from five to seven persons may be organized in each village in order to attain speed and quality in the work of the Soviet .
Select on a -voluntary basis comrades from among the representatives and the masses those who are activists and have the capability to work to participate in these commando units , with each village having a leader of a , commando unit .
Members should not be selected from the same household .
Work of the commando unit will be done in two ways .
The first kind will be for the member of one household to dp commando work in the other ( such as member of household A going to household B and vice versa ) .
But the emphasis will be to have members of advanced household going to the more backward ones .
The other kind is within the sphere of the township , with commando units of one village going to another village to do commando work ( village A going to village B ) and it should primarily be on the basis of units from progressive villages going to more backward ones to do commando work .
Doing commando work is not to cuss at other people but to help with the work that is being done there , teaching them Better ways so that the work there will improve rapidly and educating them in the work methods of the more advanced villages and households .
A unit leader in overall command of the commando units will be appointed under the township soviet presidium who will administer all the units and who will have the authority to deploy the commando units of the various villages .
The presidium should call periodical meetings of commanders of village and township commando units to examine their work and tell them how to go about their work .
These units1 leaders will then convene meetings of commando units members and give them training .
The presidium should also convene all of the members of the commando units on a monthly or bi @-@ monthly basis to.train them .
On the Leadership Exercised by the District Soviet Over the Township Soviet
The district soviet must direct the ! township soviet to implement all of the aforementioned items accordingly , explaining these items to the comrades of the township soviet so that they will have full understanding .
Spot checks will be made on whether the township Soviets are carrying out the aforementioned items as described .
More frequent explanations and assistants must be given , especially toward those township Soviets whose work is falling behind .
Examinations of the district Soviet &apos;s work by higher echelon will be based upon whether the district soviet has given thorough leadership to the various townships under its jurisdiction in implementing the aforementioned items to realise the best in quality and speed in the various tasks set by the Soviet .

COMRADE MAO TSE @-@ TUNG ON SCHEMES OF JAPANESE IMPERIALISM April 1934
&#91; Text &#93; On 17 April , the Foreign Ministry of Imperialist Japan published its note to the big powers regarding their China policy .
Since then , the imperialist countries , from the viewpoint of their interests in their spheres of influence in China , have made known opinions expressing dissatisfaction , Immediately , the Kuomintang Nanking government also published treasonous comments of the most shameless nature .
In order to secure the views of the Central Government of the Chinese Soviet &quot; Republic on this matter , the reporter of this paper made a special visit to interview Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung .
The following is the conversation that ensued .
The recent note of the Japanese Foreign Ministry is the clearest indication of Japanese imperialist &apos;s plan to gain sole control of China .
In this note , Japanese imperialism has openly defined China as a Japanese protectorate .
It has directly set forth its policy of protecting , with the force of arms , Japan &apos;s monopoly of all military , political and economic matters in China .
This plan of Japanese imperialism is to directly suppress the Chinese Revolution with its own powers in the course of gaining sole control , and completely colonize China , as well as to create an even more consolidated rear defense area so as to launch a war against the Soviet Union .
Although this plan of Japanese imperialism met with the opposition of other imperialist countries , the true intent of this opposition is limited to their unwillingness to see Japan gain sole control of China and their desire to have China divided up by international imperialism and become the &quot; open door @-@ common colony of all .
With regard to the direct suppression of China &apos;s revolution and the strengthening of the rear area defense for the war against the Soviet Union , the various imperialist countries are naturally in complete accord with Japan .
The traitorous Kuomintang Government of China , behaves in the most shameless and pitiful manner , On the 19th , the spokesman of the Kupmintang Nanking government published a vile and base statement in which it held that it is the &quot; natural obligation &quot; of the Kuomintang Government to &quot; propose international cooperation in order to achieve international peace and security , &quot; That is to say , to propose the joint partition of China by international imperialism and to guarantee the security of international imperialism &apos;s interests in China ,
Of course , the Kuomintang truly &quot; never had the desire to harm any nation , &quot; and it is even more true that it entertains no Idea of disturbing the peace qf Asia . &quot; The Kuomintang explains carefully to Japan : &quot; The procurement of military supplies ( such as military aircraft ) and the employment of foreign military training officers and experts are only for national defense needs , and they are mostly for maintaining domestic peace and order . &quot;
Nevertheless , the fact is such that not a single penny of the loans obtained from the various countries of Britain , France , America and Italy , nor a single bullet from the equipment bought from these countries , has been used by the Kuomintang to oppose Japanese imperialism &apos;s aggression in Manchuria and North China and British and French violent and forceful occupation of Tibet , The Kuomintang has always adopted an attitude of compromise and capitulation toward imperialist aggression that does not even come near to anything like national defense .
What is actually meant by the Kuomintang &apos;s so @-@ called &quot; maintaining domestic order and peace &quot; is the suppression of the worker ^ peasant revolutionary movement in China , and , especially , the offensive against the Soviet areas and the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army .
Chiang Kai @-@ shek , the arch criminal of national @-@ betrayal , deployed 70 percent of his regular troops in Kiangsi Province to carry out its fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; This is exactly an expression of the KuomintangTs loyalty to imperialism , playing the role of street sweeper for imperialism in dividing up China .
The Kuominta.ng has specifically underscored this point in its explanation to Japan .
The Kuomintang went a step further to announce that &quot; If existing unequal matters can be rectified , improvements may be made in Sino @-@ Japanese relations , thereby preserving the common interests of the two countries , &quot; This is ample expression of the slavish nature of the Kuomintang running dog .
The Kuomintang made such a shameless , tail @-@ wagging announcement to the Japanese to gain their sympathy because it was fearful of not being able to efficiently discharge its duties as a dog and being unable to please every one of its owners .
The Soviet Central Government , representing the hard @-@ working worker- &apos; peasant masses of China and the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army , resolutely opposes Japanese imperialism &apos;s plan to gain sole control of China and points out the KuomintangTs plot to guide imperialism toward a common partitioning of China .
In order tq achieve freedom arid liberation for the nation and society . , the masses of Chinese workers and peasants must rise as one and , under the leadership of the Soviet regime , , smash the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; of the Soviet Red Army by the imperialist Kuomititang .
This is the only way to obstruct the path to complete colonization of China , and wrest victory for the Soviet new China .

DECLARATION OF THE CHINESE WORKER @-@ PEASANT RED ARMY ON ITS INTENTION TO MARCH NORTH TO COMBAT JAPANESE AGGRESSION
15 July 1934
&#91; Text &#93; Workers , peasants , soldiers and all revolutionary people in the
country !
The devilish Japanese imperialists have swallowed up our three eastern provinces ( Heilungkiangj Kirin and Liaoning ) , invaded and occupied Jehol and Inner Mongolia .
Now they have again seized our entire North China .
In South China , Japanese imperialism is planning the direct occupation of Fukien Province with the use of big naval guns and their army , navy and air forces .
It intends to transform all China into a colony and turn the people of China into colonial slaves , to forever suffer the butchery of Japanese bandits and to be raped , exploited and ravaged by them !
The warlords of the Kuomintang , Chiang Kai @-@ shek and Chang Hsueh @-@ liang and others , have always adopted an attitude of surrender and betrayal in dealing with Japanese imperialist aggression .
They sold out the three eastern provinces , Jehol and Inner Mongolia .
Now they are directly trafficking with &quot; Manchukuo , &quot; recognizing that entity and selling out all of North China and Fukien Province .
They are helping Japanese imperialism to suppress the Chinese anti @-@ Japanese movement , the boycott of Japanese goods and the * guerrilla warfare waged by the anti @-@ Japanese Volunteer Army .
Under the pretext of &quot; no strength to oppose Japan , &quot; they amassed over a million soldiers from all over China , expended 100 million silver yuan and used all the planes and artillery they have to launch endless &quot; encirclements &quot; against the only anti @-@ Japanese , anti @-@ imperialist Soviet government of the workers and peasants and the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army .
All these testify that the Kuomintang warlords are the loyalist of the running dogs of Japanese imperialism .
The Kuomintang warlords are the biggest traitors and national betrayers in the history of China .
In dealing with the non @-@ stop aggression of Japanese imperialism , the Chinese Soviet Government and the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army have repeatedly called on
the people of China to arm and oppose Japanese imperialist aggression with national revolutionary warfare .
They openly declared war and issued emergency mobilization orders for war against Japan to mobilize tbe people in the entire Soviet area and prepare them to directly fight against Japanese imperialism .
The Soviet Government and the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army have repeatedly proclaimed to the people of China that under the three conditions of :
1 ) Cease all attacks against Soviet areas and the Red Army ;
2 ) Cede to the people the initial powers toward democratic rightsthe freedom of speech , publication , assembly and association and the freedom to strike and demonstrate ; and
3 ) Immediately arm the people and create a people &apos;s anti @-@ Japanese volunteer army to defend China , &quot; they are willing to conclude a fighting agreement with any armed unit .
The Soviet Government and the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army have repeatedly opposed the Tangku agreement , direct negotiations between China and Japan , recognition of the Japanese puppet government of &quot; Manchukuo &quot; and the Kuomintang betrayal of North China .
They have repreatedly called for open aid to the anti @-@ Japanese volunteer army in North China and all revolutionary movements in China opposing Japan and imperialism and opposition against all suppressions and slaughter perpetrated by imperialism and the Kuomintang against the anti @-@ Japanese , anti @-@ imperialism
movement .
The broad masses of workers , peasants , soldiers and revolutionary people throughout China are against the Kuomintang &apos;s betrayal of Jehol , the three eastern provinces ( Heilungkiang , Liaoning and Kirin ) , Inner Mongolia , North China , Fukien Province and all of China , and support the proposal of the Soviet Government and the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army to oppose Japan and their anti @-@ Japan activities .
This has compelled the Kuomintang to blockade us even more frantically and attack us , thereby preventing our Soviet Government and the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army from uniting directly with the people of China , from carrying out unified action with the anti ^ Japanese Volunteer Army in North China to launch a national revolution against the Japanese imperialists and drive the bandits of Japanese imperialism from China .
Rot only have the Kuomintang warlords completely ignored the proposal to unite with the Soviet Government and the Worker ~ Peasant Red Army and together oppose Japan , but they have even more shamelessly betrayed China and stepped up the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; of the Soviet Government and the Workers @-@ Peasant Red Army to help Japanese imperialism swallow up China ,
In order to mobilize all their forces to fight directly against Japanese imperialism , the Soviet Government and the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army have been forced to first engage in bloody combat with the over 2 @-@ million @-@ man \ bandit army of the Kuomintang which have been attacking us so as to preserve
the free , Soviet territories , which have already shaken off the fetters of imperialism and prevent them from ever again being trampled upon and betrayed by the Kuomintang , the running dogs of imperialism .
We absolutely will not abandon the anti @-@ imperialist revolutionary base of China formed through countless bloody battles with the bandit army of the Kuomintang .
The Soviet Government and the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army absolutely cannot idly watch the enslavement of the Chinese nation by Japanese imperialism , absolutely will not permit the traitors and national betrayers in the Kuomintang to completely auction off all of China .
They absolutely will not allow Japanese imperialism to ravage and perpetrate mass butchery of the broad masses of the hard @-@ working people of China , nor can it allow the solitary struggle of the Northwest Volunteer Army to go on ( without support ) .
The Soviet Government and the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army , at the crucial moment of the merciless , decisive battle against the superior force of the Kuomintang bandit army , have , with the greatest of determination and disregarding all difficulties , dispatched an anti @-@ Japanese vanguard force to march north to fight the Japanese .
If only the armed units that are attacking us can accept the three conditions we have set forth , the main strength of our Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army can then march north in full force , following the vanguard unit to unite with all armed forces in China and fight the Japanese together .
People.of all China !
The vanguard unit of the Chinese Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army marching north to fight the Japanese is willing to unite with the people of China and all armed forces to fight together against the Japanese , launch a people &apos;s national revolutionary war and overthrow Japanese imperialism .
All the people opposing Japan should help the vanguard unit of our Workers @-@ Peasant Red Army now marching north to fight against Japan , unite and rally around this vanguard force , join its column , arm and fight &quot; directly against the bandits of Japanese imperialism attacking China .
All people opposing Japan are our compatriots and all armed units fighting aga.inst Japan are fellow travellers .
We should all unite .
All individuals , groups or armed units who prohibit or oppress our opposition against Japan are traitors and betrayers of the nation .
We should all arise and wipe them out !
We hold that only a national revolution waged by the armed units of the people of all China can overthrow Japan and all imperialism and secure the independence and liberation of the Chinese nation and preserve the territorial integrity of China .
For attaining victory in the national revolution the Soviet Government and the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army make these concrete proposals .
Resolutely oppose the selling out of the three eastern provinces , Jehol , Inner Mongolia , North China , Fukien Province and all China by the
Kuomintang Government , oppose direct negotiations between China and Japan to sell out and take over the nation , oppose the recognition of the puppet &quot; Manchukuo , &quot; and discard the dream of getting help from the League of Nations , the bandit clique of imperialism and from U.S.
imperialism .
Immediately proclaim the severing of relations with Japan , and the abrogation of the Tangku agreement and all secret Sino @-@ Japanese treaties .
Mobilize the entire Chinese Army , Navy and Air Force to fight against Japan .
Immediately cease the attacks on the Soviet areas and stop blockading them so that the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army can be fully utilized in direct battle with Japanese imperialism .
Call on the people throughout the country to arm themselves with all of the weapons in the Kuomintang arsenals and in the Central Ordnance Factory , and the armaments being imported , organize anti @-@ Japanese people &apos;s voluntary armies and guerrilla warfare and war against Japan and give active support to the Northeast Volunteer Army and the vanguard force of the Chinese Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army marching north to fight the Japanese .
Confiscate all business enterprises and assets of Japanese imperialists traitors and national betrayers , stop all payments of principal and interest on all debts owed by China to Japan , establish a progressive tax system and seize the entire military budget of the Kuomintang to use as combat funds against the Japanese ( to finance the war against Japan ) .
Organize anti- Japanese people &apos;s groups on a general scale ( such as anti @-@ Japanese associations , committees for boycotting Japanese goods , committees for the solicitation of funds in support of the volunteer army and the Red Array , as well as all kinds of anti- Japanese control units , sabotage units , communication units , propaganda units and transportation units .
Absorb the broad masses into the anti &apos; - Japanese groups without regard to age , sex , creed or political faction and use strikes , boycott of classes , absenteeism and closing of shops to oppose the aggression of Japanese imperialism and the national betrayal and capitulation of the Kuomintang Government .
The Soviet Government and the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army will struggle for this program without regard to any and all sacrifices .
The Soviet Government and the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army ask the people of all China to support this program and , together with us , struggle to the end for the implementation of this program ,
Let the Kuomintang . , the running dog of imperialism and the traitors and national betrayers in the Kuomintang clamor that &quot; China has no strength to oppose Japan ! &quot;
The antiJapanese general mobilization of the people of China , the Ja , panese armed forces countrywide , the anti @-@ Japanese people &apos;s group through--out the nation have all the power to overthrow Japan and all imperialism and to overthrow the Kuomintang , this clique of traitors and national betrayers !

COMRADE MAO TSE @-@ TUNG TALKS ON CURRENT SITUATION AND THE ANTI @-@ JAPANESE VANGUARD UNIT OF THE RED ARMY
July 1934
&#91; Text &#93; The correspondent of this paper called on Chairman Mao of the Central Government yesterday to inquire on the question of the current situation and the Anti @-@ Japanese Vanguard Unit of the Red Army .
The talk follows .
After seizing Manchuria and Jehol by force and gaining control of PTing @-@ chin &#91; 1627 3160 &#93; to achieve open traffic and communication and following its publication of the announcement of its intention to solely take over China and its presentation to the Kuomintang of a list of over 1,000 &quot; unresolved issues &apos; 1and a demand for their resolution- ^ Japanese imperialism has begun stepping up its new offensive to swallow up China .
The Japanese Government recently presented to the United States of America its suggestion to divide the Pacific Ocean equally between the two countries .
It is frenziedly preparing for an anti @-@ Soviet Union war in northern Manchuria and held the Dailen Conference with Kuomintang representatives , clearly indicating that Japanese imperialism is striving to mitigate the struggles between the imperialists in an attempt to achieve a temporary understanding among them and , together , divide up China , attack the Chinese revolution and oppose the Soviet Union .
The Kuomintang Nanking Government , the running dog of Japanese imperialism , is presently spreading a smoke screen of &quot; abrogate the Tangku Agreement &quot; and &quot; recover the war areas &quot; to cover up the Dailen Conference , which is very rapidly selling out all of China and , on another side , the veteran pro @-@ Japanese Pei Yang &#91; 0554 3152 &#93; warlord , An Fu @-@ hsi &#91; 1344 4395 4762 &#93; is fully cooperating with the Kuomintang .
Such Important people as Wang Ke @-@ min &#91; 3769 0344 2404 &#93; are streaming south and holding secret talks in Shanghai and at Mo @-@ ch &apos;ien @-@ shan &#91; 5359 0578 1472 &#93; with Huang Fu &#91; 7806 6744 &#93; , T &apos;ang You @-@ jen &#91; 0781 2589 1103 &#93; and others .
Tuan Ch &apos;i @-@ jui &#91; 3003 4388 3843 &#93; , a chieftain of An Fu @-@ hsi , went to Lu Shan &#91; 1687 1472 &#93; and conferred in secret with Chiang Kai @-@ shek .
This kind of massive cooperation between new and old traitors wholly shows that there is a high urgency in the new offensive of Japanese imperialism .
The Chinese nation has come to an extremely dangerous juncture .
The fate of slavery and doom is threatening the hard @-@ working masses of the entire country .
The new offensive of Japanese imperialism and the massive attacks of the Kuomintang on our Soviet areas are completely coordinated as one .
Several hundred thousand Kuomintang troops are advancing from the doorway areas of the Soviet regionKuang @-@ ch1ang &#91; 1684 2490 &#93; , Lien @-@ ch &apos;eng &#91; 6647 1004 &#93; , Lung @-@ kang &#91; 7873 1481 &#93; and T &apos;ai @-@ ho &#91; 3141 0735 &#93; into the central areas to carry out the last stage of the fifth encirclement , planning to bathe the Soivet area in blood , wipe out the Soviet Red Army and be the most dutiful running dog of imperialism in carving up China .
These are the special characteristics of the current situation .
To protect their own territory and take punitive action against the traitorsthe Kuomintangthe Soviet Government and the Red Army are leading the broad masses and the heroic and courageous Red Army to unleash the most intensive and blood battles on various fronts against the enemy .
They are putting all their forces and applying all means to the task of smashing this brutal &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; The Soviet and the Red Army have long ago made up their minds to smash this ferocious encirclement , no matter what happens .
Now it is even more necessary for us to utilize all resoluteness , tenacity and perseverance to smash this encirclement .
By so doing we will also be sure of smashing it in the end .
In the most recent period we have created 70,000 new Red Army soldiers in the Soviet area and mobilized several hundred thousand tan of grain to solve the problem of supply between seasons , and , presently , we are carrying out the great mobilization for the autumn harvest .
Our guerrilla forces have been greatly expanded and they are still being expanded .
Guerrilla warfare is spreading on a wide scale .
A mass movement of boiling salt and weaving cloth is underway to provide material support .
Military industry , such as the manufacturing of ammunition , has increased by several tens of times .
The Kuomintang does not even dream that we have such strength .
The Kuomintang has early claimed that we were in a &quot; very poor position &quot; and they had won big victories .
But the facts proved , and will prove in the end , that it is the rotten @-@ to @-@ the @-@ core Kuomintang that is in a &quot; very poor position . &quot; Chiang Kai @-@ shek , very pleased with himself , began to build blockhouses for several thousand li and several tens of layers deep in the Soviet areas and boasted how their &quot; easy @-@ pickingsr @-@ fishing in packed waters &quot; policy was soon to &quot; succeed , &quot; True , Chiang Kai @-@ shek .
has built many blockhouses and he has occupied some of our areasNlngtu and Hsing Kuo .
Many of the Kuomintang units , however , were routed and annihilated under the iron fists of the Red Army .
These are things Chiang Kai @-@ shek does not mention and prohibits from being mentioned .
Such a stupid pig as Chiang Kai @-@ shek does not understand that in the end it is Chiang Kai @-@ shek and the entire landlord capitalist Kuomintang and not the Soviet Red Army , who will be in a &quot; very poor position . &quot; They also do not understand that it is the imperialists who are directing the Chiang Kai @-@ shek Kuomintang who will , in the end , be in a very &quot; difficult position . &quot;
Let me again point out two things .
First , what kind of influence is imparted to the over 1 million soldiers of theirs sent to attack our Soviet areas ( Kiangsi , Szechwan , Hunan , Fukien and Hupeh ^ Hotian @-@ Anhwei ) when confronted
with the Soviet Red Army ?
We would like to say that such a broad mass of soldiers were , on the one hand , forced Co attack us , and , on the other hand , they were receiving our revolutionary education .
It can be said that the various Soviet areas are universities where the soldiers of the White armies are educated in revolution .
It is not only the Red Army , but also his own soldiers , who are helping to dig the grave of Chiang Kai @-@ shek .
May I ask , does this stupid pig , Chiang Kai @-@ shek , understand this ?
Second , the Kuomintang is frantically selling out the country , daily groveling on its hands and knees before imperialism , the arch enemy of the people throughout China , and presenting China to Japanese imperialism .
Not a shot was fired against the several hundred @-@ thousand Japanese bandit troops .
But all the troops it has from the three eastern provinces , Jehol , Peking , Tientsin , Shanghai , Hangchow , Hankow and Honan , Hopeh , Kiangsu and Chekiang were deployed to attack the Red Army while these areas were presented to imperialism to be ravaged and oppressed .
Similarly , Ch &apos;en Chi @-@ t &apos;ang &#91; 7115 3444 2768 &#93; did not guard against Hong Kong ( British imperialism &apos;s base for aggression against China ) but handed the Canton @-@ Kowloon railway to the British and deployed 80 percent of his troops to Kiangsi and Fukien to attack the Red Army .
Will the broad masses of these areas allow Chiang Kai @-@ shek and Ch &apos;en Chi @-@ t &apos;ang to go on selling out the country like this to the very end ?
No .
They absolutely will not .
As for Chiang Kai @-@ shek and Ch &apos;en Chi @-@ t &apos;ang , ( as well as Chang Hsueh @-@ liang &#91; 1728 1331 5328 &#93; , Ho Chien &#91; 0149 6943 &#93; and others ) , tens of thousands of bombs are buried right underneath their legs .
These bombs have exploded or are exploding in some areas ( the anti @-@ Japanese Volunteer Army of the three eastern provinces of Kirin , Heilungkiang and Liaoning , the People &apos;s Revolutionary Army , the Shanghai campaign , guerrilla attacks in various areas , and people &apos;s uprisings ) .
In some areas , bombs will explode on a massive scale .
Please tell me , who among the hard @-@ working masses of the country and the soldiers of the White armies does not support the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s five big programs of opposition to the Japanese ?
Who does not support the order of the Soviet Central Government declaring war on Japan ?
Who does not accept the call made by the Soviet Central Government and the Revolutionary Military Affairs Committee to &quot; desist from attacking the Red Army , unite with the Red Army to fight together against Japanese imperialism ? &quot; There is no doubt that if they only read or hear about our programs , order , and call , they will jump up and be willing to carry them out .
There is no doubt that the storm of nationwide opposition against Japan and imperialism will break and gather force under the call of the bright , Red banner .
At a time when the Kuomintang has sold out half of China and the people throughout the country , as though anticipating rain in a time of severe drought , look forward to the Red Army &apos;s march north to fight the Japanese , the Soviet Central Government and the Revolutionary Military Affairs Committee , on 1 August of this year when the working people of the world were staging massive demonstrations against the imperialist war of aggression , dispatched an antir @-@ Japanese vanguard unit .
It has been approaching Fuchow for the
last 2 days and will pass through the various provinces in the east as it marches north to fight the Japanese .
The purpose of this is to make the people throughout China realize that in all of China the Red Army is the only army that is truly in opposition to the Japanese .
Although the main force of the Red Army has been prevented from marching north by the Kuomintang &apos;s fifth encirclement , it is now proceeding to smash it and only after thoroughly smashing the Kuomintang &apos;s encirclement can the Red Army march north in strength .
Meanwhile , it has dispatched a vanguard unit of its own forces .
Although this force has only one vanguard unit it is fully combat effective and has ample fire power .
The fighters and commanders are all of high calibre and they have already shown the greatest courage in battles against the Kuomintang troops .
Although this unit is not heavily equipped , we believe that it will receive the support of the people along the way .
All those elements in the Kuomintang forces who are determined to fight Japan will join the ranks of this unit in an endless stream and it will very rapidly grow into a huge force for fighting the Japanese .
Chiang Kai @-@ shek and his Nanking Government , this faithful running dog of Japanese imperialism , in order to discharge its duty , will surely send troops to block the path as the unit marches north .
If this should be so , then the vanguard unit will have to fight the blocking troops of Chiang Kai @-@ shek as it advances .
This will necessitate directing massive propaganda toward the soldiers of this blocking force to win their sympathy and collapse their ranks so that the march up north will be fast .
The sooner we fight the Japanese the better it will be because the new offensive of Japanese imperialism is imminent .
Fangs are bared and claws unsheathed as all the imperialists prepare to divide up China and the disaster looming over the heads of the people all over the country is growing greater and greater .
We are , .therefore , calling for the country to rise as one and help the Soviet Red Army so that we will be able to quickly smash the fifth encirclement and concentrate our forces to fight against Japan and oppose imperialism .
Give assistance to our anti @-@ Japanese vanguard unit so as to enable the anti @-@ Japanese Red Army to march forward rapidly .
The anti @-@ Japanese vanguard unit of the Chinese Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army is now on the move !
Our courageous and heroic Worker ^ Peasant Red Army has taken concrete action to oppose the aggression of Japanese imperialism and to save China from disaster .
Simultaneously , the Soviet Government and the Revolutionary Military Affairs Committee have issued orders : for the Red Army throughout the country to be ready to move out at any time after the vanguard unit .
But , the Kuomintang is blocking the Red Army with a huge force of several hundred thousand , deploying its entire northern army southward into Kiangsi Province , People of China , is it still unclear to you ?
The Kuomintang is the street sweeper for Japanese imperialism .
People of the country and brothers of the White Army , oppose the Kuomintang policy of national betrayal and surrender !
We demand the general mobilization of the army , navy and air force to fight
the Japanese !
Oppose the attacks against the Red Army !
The guns of all the troops in China should be pointed and fired at Japanese imperialism and at the traitors who are betraying the nation !
Only thus can we , and will we , be victorious over Japanese Imperialism !

ORDER OF CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE CHINESE SOVIET REPUBLIC 15 August 1934
&#91; Text &#93; K &apos;ung Ho @-@ ch &apos;ung &#91; 1313 5440 1404 &#93; was a member of the Central Executive Committee and former commander of the Red .
16th Army .
While working in the Hunan @-@ Kwangtung @-@ Kiangsi Soviet area he disobeyed orders of the Central Revolutionary Military Committee several times , He was panicky and vacillating in attacks against the enemy and he led the Red Army in retreat and flight .
In consideration of the fact that elements of the counterrevolutionary liquidation faction infiltrated the unit and caused heavy losses to the Red 16th Army and the people of the Hunan @-@ Kwangtung @-@ Kiangsi Soviet area , he was several times educated through criticism , but to no avail .
Last October , he was relieved of his command of the Red 16th Army , but hoping that he would still be amenable to education , he was ordered to report to the Central Government for admission to the Red Army University to be educated .
Not only did he show no Improvement whatsoever , but also took to opposing the revolution .
When he was assigned to the Replacement Division in July of this year he seized this opportunity to escape and surrender to the enemy .
A member of the Central Executive Committee , K &apos;ung Ho @-@ ch &apos;ung , who has a relatively long history of struggle , could not see the victorious future of the revolution and resorted to the most despicable action of rebellion at a time when our courageous and heroic Red Army and the broad masses were engaged in the final and decisive battle against &quot; the enemy &apos;s fifth encirclement .
Besides expelling him from the Central Committee , a special order has been issued to all the Red armies in China , various local units and the various levels of the Soviet Government and the revolutionary groups in various areas and the worker @-@ peasant masses of the Soviet and White areas are called upon , that if Kfung Ho @-@ ch &apos;ung is encountered , he should be executed on the spot as a warning to the vacillating and the rebellious .

FINAL DECISION OF CCP CENTRAL COMMITTEE AGAINST ENEMY &apos;S FIFTH ENCIRCLEMENT
Adopted at Tsun @-@ i Conference of Political Bureau on 8 January 1935
8 January 1935
&#91; Text &#93; After listening to the summation report made by Comrade x x on the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; campaign and the supplementary report by Comrade x x x the enlarged session of the Political Bureau held that the report made by Comrade x x is basically incorrect .
In its decision on the enemy &apos;s fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; the CCP Central Committee has clearly pointed out that the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; is an ever more vicious offensive launched against the soviet revolutionary movement by imperialism and Kuomintang reaction .
It also pointed out at the same time that in this ferocious and decisive battle of the classes , the inner weaknesses of imperialism and the Kuomintang , and the new intensification of the revolutionary situation , has caused a new change in the relative strength of the classes in the country which is favorable to us , and it has arrived at the correct conclusion that &quot; In the midst of the fifth &apos; &apos; encirclement and suppression11 we possess all the conditions for winning a decisive victory , which are even more adequate than before &quot; ( CCP Central Committee decision 20 July 1933 ) .
But , in his report , Comrade x x over @-@ estimated objective difficulties .
He placed the reason for the inability to smash the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; in the central Soviet area on the strong and powerful forces of imperialism and the Kuomintang .
But , at the same time , he did not adequately appraise the current revolutionary situation .
This will certainly lead to an opportunistic conclusion that , on the objective level , it will definitely be impossible to smash the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot;
The CCP Central Committee , in accordance with its own correct decision , has set forth concrete tasks for opposing the enemy &apos;s fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; One @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half year &apos;s difficult struggle against &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; has proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that the CCP Central Committee &apos;s political line is correct .
Especially , the party committee in the central Soviet area , under the direct leadership of the CCP Central Committee , has achieved unprecedented results in mobilizing the broad masses of workers and peasants to participate in the revolutionary war .
The movement to expand the Red Army has become an upsurge
of the masses .
The mobilization of worker and peasant activists ?
arming and sending them to the front , has reached over 100 ? 000 , thereby greatly expanding the Red Army .
The model Red Youth Units are beginning to turn into rear support troops for the Red Army , and the people &apos;s armed organizations of the Red Youth Units have achieved great growth .
Under the slogan of &quot; all for victory on the front &quot; the party committee has resolved financial , food and all other material needs of the Red Army .
The intensification of the class struggle inside the Soviet area , the economic construction of the soviet and the thorough improvement of relations between the soviet government and the masses have even more vigorously developed the masses1 enthusiasm and activism for participation in the revolutionary campaigns .
All these have created favorable conditions for the thorough smashing of the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression / 1 However , in his report , Comrade xx was clearly inadequate in his appraisal of these favorable conditions .
Coming from this kind of inadequate appraisal it will be inevitable to reach the conclusion that on the subjective level we will have no ability to smash the &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot;
It should be pointed out that there are still many serious shortcomings in our work .
With regard to the party &apos;s leadership of the broad masses of workers and peasants in opposing imperialism and the Kuomintang in the White area , and the leadership of the daily struggles , it still has not shown any marked progress .
The development of guerrilla warfare and the work of collapsing the soldiers of the White army are still weak .
The mutual help and coordination between the Red armies in the various Soviet areas given under a unified strategic purpose are still insufficient .
All these weaknesses will undoubtedly affect the action taken to oppose the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; and it will become an important cause for our inability to smash the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; The existence of these weaknesses absolutely must not be construed as the chief reason for the inability to smash the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; But , in his report and conclusion Comrade x x exaggerated on these weaknesses in the work .
And yet he did not understand , nor did he acknowledge , the basically erroneous estimates made on the strategic and tactical levels of the military leadership .
This has prevented us from understanding where the main reason for the inability of the main force of our Red Army to leave the central Soviet area and our inability to smash the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; in this area was .
It covered up the evil fruits of the erroneous line in the strategic and tactical area of our military leadership .
With the courage and skill of the Red Army in combat , model rear area work and the support of the broad masses notwithstanding , it will be impossible to achieve a decisive victory in the war if we cannot apply correct strategy and tactics in our military leadership .
Herein lies the principal reason for our inability to smash the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; in the central Soviet area .
After suffering defeats in four &quot; encirclement and suppressions , &quot; the Kuomintang , Chiang Kai @-@ shek and his imperialist military advisers have learned that it was extremely unfavorable to use the strategy and tactic of &quot; penetrating deeply &quot; to give us battle inside the Soviet areas .
Therefore , in the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; they adopted the strategy
and tactic of protracted warfare and blockhouse warfare in an attempt to gradually whittle away our effective strength and our material and financial resources , constrict our Soviet area , and , finally , to search out our main force and engage it in decisive battle so as to achieve the objective of wiping us out .
Under these circumstances our strategic line should be defense through decisive engagements ( offensive defense ) .
Concentrate superior forces , select the enemy &apos;s weak spots , and , by using mobile warfare , confidently go about wiping out a part , or a major part , of the enemy , destroying them one at a time and thoroughly smashing the enemy &apos;s &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; thoroughly .
In the campaign against the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; defense through decisive engagements was substituted with the line of pure defense ( defensive defense ) , mobile warfare was substituted with positional warfare and blockhouse warfare and the tactical principle of &quot; short , swift thrusts &quot; was applied to support this kind of strategic battle lines of pure defense .
This enabled the enemy &apos;s strategy and tactic of protracted war and blockhouse warfare to achieve their objective and caused the main force of our Red Army to suffer partial losses and to withdraw from the central Soviet base area .
It should be pointed out that this line is diametrically opposite to the basic principle of the strategy and tactics that would achieve victory for our Red Army .
At this present stage of the Civil War in China when we do not yet have the coordination of worker uprisings in big cities and towns and the mutiny of White soldiers , when our Red Army is still very inadequate in numbers , when our Soviet areas still constitute only a small part of China , when we still lack special weaponry such as planes and artillery , and when we are still in a situation of having to fight from interior lines , our strategic line , naturally , will be defense through decisive engagements when the enemy launches his &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; and attacks us .
That is , our defense will not be pure defense , but a defense seeking for a decisive en ^ gagement and then switching over to the counteroffensive .
Pure defense can drain the enemy to a considerable degree and it can preserve territory for a certain period of time .
But it will be impossible to protect the Soviet area by smashing the &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; in the end , and there is no hope of achieving final victory .
It is only by going from the defense to the counteroffensive ( on a campaign and strategic level ) and then to the offensive , winning victory in decisive engagements and wiping out enemy effective strength on a massive scale can we smash the enemy , protect the Soviet area and develop the Soviet revolutionary movement .
With this strategic line we should not immediately engage the attacking enemy in decisive battle we are not confident of winning before we have discovered and exploited the weaknesses of the enemy , what we should do is to continue to confuse and lure the enemy on various fronts by using our secondary forces ( such as guerrilla units , people1s armed force , independent battalions and regiments , and part of the Red Army &apos;s main force ) .
In this regard , the main thing is to contain the enemy with mobile warfare while the main forces withdraw to a suitable distance or move out on the enemy &apos;s
flanks or his rear areas , conceal and concentrate and seek favorable opportunity and launch surprise attacks on the enemy .
Under the situation of fighting along interior lines , the withdrawal and concealment of the Red Army in the face of enemy &apos;s attacks with superior forces will be fully adequate to tire out the enemy and cause him to become arrogant and careless and to commit errors and expose their weaknesses .
This creates the condition for switching over to the counteroffensive and winning victory in decisive battles .
We must most carefully analyze and appraise the enemy situation so that the engagement will be properly planned and launched at a favorable time .
Do not permit enemy &apos;s feints and provocations to make us unnecessarily deploy our forces and engage the enemy and become fatigued , thereby causing us to lose the opportunity for victory in decisive engagements toward a certain direction .
In order to achieve victory , we do not have to block the path the attack is taking when the enemy begins his advance in accordance to ( his ) plan .
We should wait until he has penetrated to a suitable distance and then encircle and wipe him out ( that is , luring the enemy to penetrate deeply ) .
For the purpose of achieving victory we will do whatever is necessary , temporarily abandoning part of the territory of the Soviet area , even to the extent of having the main force withdraw temporarily from the Soviet base area , because we know that we will not only be able to recover abandoned territory , but also expand the territory of the Soviet area if we only can annihilate the enemy and smash his &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; All these are for the purpose of enabling the Red Army to always assume the active role and fight successfully against the enemy &apos;s attacks and &quot; encirclement and suppression , &quot; and to always avoid a passive role and its ensuing unfavorable results .
All these principles , however , were flouted in the fifth battle .
In February of last year a cable from the Communist International correctly expounded this : &quot; We feel as if nearly all the plans and measures adopted by the military command during this period were frequently produced by the pressures brought to bear by the enemy .
The enemy &apos;s provocations have caused us to engage in unnecessary reorganization of our forces .
Therefore , our forces were unable to participate vigorously in engagements with the ( enemy because of continuous changes .
We feel that we should defeat the enemy in those areas where we have already won certain victories , and refrain from attempting to defeat the enemy on all fronts at the same time , &quot;
The leaders of the pure defense line were unable to understand this kind of instruction from the Comintern , therefore , the pure defense line , which was wholeheartedly willing to place itself in a passive role , did not , and was also unable to , plan to defeat the enemy on all fronts at the same time , but attempted to stop the enemy on all fronts at the same time .
This was so not only prior to February of last year but also after the main force of the Red Army had to withdraw from the Soviet area .
The slogan
&quot; attack on all fronts &quot; set forth in the past by Comrade x x x became resistance on all fronts during the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; Strategically speaking , both of them are wrong .
Politically , the slogan &quot; do not abandon an inch of soviet territory &quot; is correct , but it becomes wholly erroneous when mechanically applied to strategy .
It can easily become a camouflage for the line of pure defense .
In order to win victory in a decisive engagement it is absolutely necessary to concentrate superior forces .
Currently , in a contrast between enemy forces and ours , the enemy has absolute superiority in troops .
They often attack us with troops several times , or even several tens of times , stronger than ours .
But this is not something we have to fear because the enemy is situated on the exterior line and has adopted a strategic policy of encirclement , advancing along different routes and converging to attack .
This creates the opportunity for us to defeat the enemy one &apos; at a time , and enables us to benefit from fighting along exterior lines in the campaign ( localized exterior lines ) while engaged in strategic interior line combat .
That is , contain the enemy &apos;s one line or several lines of advance with part of our forces and concentrate the greatest force to encircle and wipe out one line of the enemy &apos;s advance , using this kind of method to defeat the enemy individually and smash his &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; Under the situation of fighting along strategic interior lines , it is only by concentrating superior forces to seek victory in exterior line engagements in the campaign can it enable the Red Army to constantly grasp the initiative and force the enemy into a passive position , and finally to smash his entire plan .
In the past , however , the leaders of the pure defense line almost always scatter their forces ( primarily the dispersement of the 1st and 3d Army Corps ) in their resistance along all fronts against the enemy &apos;s advance .
The result of this dispersement has frequently put us in a passive position , weakening our forces everywhere and proving advantageous to the enemy for defeating us one at a time .
In the war of the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; we were unable to achieve victories in many of the campaigns Csuch as the campaigns at Hsun @-@ k &apos;ou &#91; 3169 0656 &#93; , T &apos;uan @-@ tsun &#91; 0957 2625 &#93; , Chien @-@ ning &#91; 1696 1337J , and Wen @-@ fang &#91; 3306 0972 &#93; because our forces were not concentrated .
The central task given the Red Army by the leaders of the pure defense line was to block the advance of the enemy in an attempt to wipe out part of the enemy with &quot; short , swift thrusts , &quot; and it was not to seize the initiative , not to win victory in decisive engagements .
The result was that the number of enemy ( .troops ) wiped out by the Red Army was very small , and , in the end , the Soviet area was also ravaged by the enemy .
Wiping out the enemy in mobile warfare is the specialty of our Peasant Red Army .
When the enemy &apos;s fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; began , the Comintern pointed out for us ( in a cable sent in October of the year before ) : &quot; In our actions we should not adopt the method of positional warfare , but adopt the method of mobile warfare on both flanks of the enemy . &quot; In last February &apos;s cable it was repeated : &quot; Based on past experience , it is plain that our troops have won many great victories in mobile warfare ,
but they were unable to win victory in battles fought by storming the blockhouse areas . &quot; These instructions from the Cominterto were completely correct .
Although we did not have the opportunity under the blockhouse warefare of the enemy &apos;s fifth encirclement to adopt mobile warfare on a massive scale as was the case with the enemy &apos;s &quot; deep penetration &quot; in the first , second , third and fourth &quot; encirclement and suppressions , &quot; the feasibility of mobile warfare still exists .
This , in practice , has been proved many times ( in the various campaigns of Hsun @-@ k &apos;ou , T &apos;uan @-@ tsun , Chiang @-@ chun @-@ tien &#91; 1412 6511 3013 &#93; , Chien @-@ ning , Wen @-@ fang , Hu @-@ fang &#91; 3275 0972 &#93; , and , especially at the time of the 19th Route Army uprising .
Nevertheless , the pure defense line which grew out of the fear of blockhouse warfare and Comrade Hua FuTs &#91; 5478 1133 &#93; theory of &quot; short , quick , thrusts &quot; caused us to switch from mobile warfare to positional warfare during the fifth campaign .
But this mode of positional warfare , at that time , was only beneficial to the enemy , and it was extremely disadvantageous to the Worker @-@ Peasant Red Army .
Under current technical conditions , storming the enemy &apos;s blockhouses should be rejected .
It is only in a situation where the blockhouses are weak , or isolated , or it is either for the purpose of striking at enemy reinforcements or to force the enemy to deploy his troops that attacks on enemy blockhouses are permitted .
Frequently , assaults on enemy blockhouses have been undertaken lightly with hardly any affect .
This is not surprising , because war has been taken as a child &apos;s game .
Due to underestimating the feasibility of mobile warfare in the fifth war , there was absolute separation of the enemyrs fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; from his first , second , third and fourth encirclements .
This , in turn , led to the absolute negation of past experiences in mobile warfare and to the absolute denial of the combat methods of luring the enemy in to wipe him out .
This , in practice , led to the reluctant rejection of the correct instructions of the Comintern and these were natural rationale for the leaders of pure defense and short , quick thrusts ,
Because of the overestimation of the enemy &apos;s blockhouse warfare and the underestimation of the feasibility of mobile warfare , the theory that victory can only be realized through tactics was born .
It held that only tactical victory can be turned into a campaign victory , and , then , victory in the campaign will bring about changes favorable to us strategically ( Comrade Hua FuTs article and comrades x x and x x letters to Lin Piao and P &apos;eng Te @-@ huai ) , It held that &quot; under blockhouse warfare there can only be many small victories but no clear @-@ cut victory &quot; ( see Comrade x xfs speech in the Political Bureau and Comrade x x &apos;s &quot; Red Star &quot; article , and it also held that blockhouse warfare can be handled only by dividing the troops to resist and by short , quick thrusts .
The theory and practice of all these strategies and tactics of opportunism in the revolutionary war became bankrupt during the fifth campaign .
We cannot deny that blockhouse warfare has created new difficulties for smashing the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; ( whereas they first reviled blockhouse warfare with the empty talk of the leftsee Comrade x xrs article in &quot; Red Star &quot; ) .
We do not deny , but should prepare for , the
technical conditions of the Red Army ( planes and artillery ) , especially the uprising of worker @-@ peasant soldiers inside the blockhouse areas so as to overcome even more powerful enemy blockhouses in the future .
However , blockhouse warfare can also be smashed , even at present .
Blockhouse warfare has fatigued the enemyTs troops and dispersed his forces .
It has fostered the enemy &apos;s dependency on the blockhouses , causing them to lose confidence of victory when they leave them .
At the same time the enemy cannot advance on us without leaving his blockhouses .
Nor can he build enough blockhouses all over the country to restrict the movement of the Red Army .
All these taken together create favorable conditions for us to overcome blockhouse warfare .
The method to be applied by the Red Army toward smashing blockhouse warfare is still dependent upon mobile warfare , dependent upon unfolding guerrilla warfare all around the blockhouse lines in a coordinated move with the Red Army and dependent upon the intensification of the movement among the White soldiers .
We wait inside the lines of the blockhouses for the enemy to advance and then destroy his troops on a massive scale outside the lines of the blockhouses , when the Red Army has moved to an area free of blockhouses to carry out its activities , to force the enemy to leave his blockhouses and engage us in mobile warfare .
If we only apply the strategic and tactical principles of mobile warfare flexibly , skillfully and with strategem , we will then certainly be able to smash the enemy &apos;s blockhouse warfare .
Only a correct strategic guideline can correctly lead a.campaign and correctly apply tactics to smash blockhouse warfare and to smash the &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; In pure defense and in &apos; &apos; short , quick thrusts &quot; victory is not mainly dependent upon correct leadership of the strategic campaign , but merely on tactics .
This , in practice , is to surrender to blockhouse warfare , not to smash it .
The understanding of the leaders of the pure defense line is also incorrect with regard to the question of protracted war and waging war with quick , decisive engagements .
The Chinese civil war is not a short @-@ term war .
It is a prolonged , protracted war .
The Soviet Revolution was developed and consolidated in the midst of the continuous smashing of the enemy &apos;s encirclements .
When favorable conditions occur , we should switch over completely from the defensive to the counteroffensive , and then to the offensive , wipe out the enemy and smash the &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; ( f ; or example , the first , second , third and fourth wars , and prior to the Kuang @-@ ch &apos;ang &#91; 1684 2490J campaign ) .
When unfavorable conditions arise we can temporarily withdraw to conserve our effective strength and then go over to the counteroffensive and offensive when other favorable conditions came into being ( for example , after the Kuang @-@ ch &apos;ang campaign of the fifth war ) .
This is the first basic principle .
Simultaneously , however , another principle must also be understood .
In order to wage a protracted and prolonged war , all efforts must be made to achieve a quick and decisive &quot; battle situation in each of the &quot; encirclement and suppressions &apos; 1 and in every one of the campaigns , because under the present balance of forces between ourselves and the enemy , it will be extremely disadvantageous for us to adopt the policy of protracted warfare toward each and every one of the &quot; encirclement and suppressions &quot; and toward each and every one of the campaigns .
We must apply a correct strategic policy and smash the enemy &apos;s plans when he uses protracted warfare against us ( as in the fifth &apos; &apos; encirclement and suppression &quot; ) and win a decisive victory in a period of time we can sustain to smash the enemy &apos;s &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; Using figures of our manpower , material resourcesiand munition supply to compare to what the Kuomintang has ( the so @-@ called competition with the enemy at attrition , see Comrade x x &apos;s article in &quot; Red Star * 1 ) --such understanding of protracted warfare is basically wrong .
In such things we are at present situated in an absolutely &quot; inferior position &quot; and such comparison of figures can only give proof of contrary conclusions .
Precisely because we must wage protracted warfare in the long @-@ range Civil War , and , at the same time , wage a campaign of quick decisions in every campaign , we must &quot; be especially careful in deciding upon our strategic campaign plans .
The strategy of pure defense pursued during the fifth war was basically wrong , and the many battles of desperate recklessness fought under this erroneous strategy ( such as the campaigns of Kuang @-@ ch &apos;ang , Mao @-@ ting @-@ san &#91; 3029 0002 0005 &#93; , San @-@ chi @-@ fang &#91; 0005 3305 0972 &#93; , P &apos;ing @-@ liao &#91; 1627 4070 &#93; and others ) were similarly erroneous .
The Red Army must avoid those battles which have no prospects of victory .
Even though the battle decision was correct at that point of time we should immediately refuse to engage in such battles when the situation changes unfavorably against us .
It is a heinous crime to play with uprisings , and it is also criminal to play with battles .
Exactly because we must wage protracted warfare and wage quick and decisive engagements in the campaign , we must provide the Red Army with the necessary time for resting its forces and for educating and training them .
These are prerequisite conditions for victory in the war .
It is wrong to say that it was not possible to rest and train during the fifth war .
That is the inevitable conclusion of proponents of pure defense and short , quick thrusts .
It is also incorrect to hold that in order to inject vigor into the Red Army activities we must have it fighting battles frequently , and without stop , and there is no need to give attention to rest and training .
Without the necessary rest and training we cannot then fight battles well and victoriously .
The organisation of the Red Army must be suitable to the environment of the current Civil War .
It is wrong to establish many new regimental and divisional units before the main force has been brought up to strength .
Only after the main force is up to strength should new units be established .
It is not right to throw into battle all by itself a division of new troops who have no education or training and who have no combat experience .
There should be a core of veteran soldiers in the division of new troops , and , in the initial stage , place them by all possible means under the command of a &apos; veteran army corps in order to have some combat experience drilled into them .
The kind of unnecessary , unweildy , top @-@ heavy organizations and those improperly equipped , should all be converted to light equipment , and the company and the leadership of units below divisional level must be strengthened .
Precisely because we must wage protracted warfare and fight short , decisive engagements in the campaign , we must oppose that kind of theory which places the need to conserve effective strength in opposition to the need to protect the Soviet area .
The heroic sacrifice of the Red Army is entirely necessary for the purpose of fighting a victorious battle .
This is the essence of the class armed forces , the foundation of victory for the revolutionary war .
This kind of sacrifice is made in exchange for victory , and this kind of victory is worthwhile .
This cannot be suitably applied to conduct a battle of desperation because we must understand that only by conserving our effective strength can we truly defend the Soviet area .
Without a powerful Red Army the Soviet area cannot be protected , while with one we can , after all , recover , even if the Soviet area sustained partial loss temporarily .
Furthermore , only by relying upon the Red Army can new Soviet areas be formed .
Under the principle of waging protracted warfare we must oppose the two kinds of erroneous tendencies which may arise after we have smashed the enemy &apos;s &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; with counteroffensive engagements .
One type is conservatism rising from fatigue and overestiraation of the enemy &apos;s strength .
This type of conservatism causes us to become disappointed and discouraged , causes us to stop and become immobile .
It causes us to become unable to go over from the counteroffensive to the offensive to wipe out even -more enemies , develop even bigger Soviet areas and expand the forces of the Red Army .
It prevents us from being able to obtain adequate conditions to smash the new &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; before its onset .
The other is adventurism rising from overestimation of one &apos;s own victory and inadequate appraisal of enemy strength .
This kind of adventurism prevents us from achieving.victory from our offensives ( such as offensives undertaken without prospects of victory , and unnecessary offensives against key cities ) , and even causes the victory already won to be wasted or go up in smoke .
It causes excessive losses to the Red Army effective strength , causes neglect in the mission to expand the Red Army , expand the Soviet territory and achieve the development and consolidation of strategic areas .
This similarly prevents us from obtaining favorable conditions to continue smashing the enemy before the coming of his &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; Opposing these two erroneous tendencies is a serious problem for the party with regard to the question of strategic offensive .
That is , in the period between the enemy &apos;s two encirclements .
Under the principle of waging quick , decisive engagements in the campaign we must oppose the opportunist tendency of hastily accepting battle , which has its roots in fear and panic , or of being imprudent in the initial battle .
We must oppose opportunist trend toward feeling that nothing could be done about it after failing to win victory in a battle against the enemy which was launched in the hope of knocking him out first , or not making adequate preparations on the pretest of launching a quick , decisive engagement , or not making all necessary preparations in a period of time that can possibly be sustained , against the enemy * s encirclement .
For a quick , decisive engagement ther are many necessary conditions ( such as strategic
superiority , correctness of campaign leadership , mobile warfare , grasping the opportune moment and concentration of forces ) to wipe out the enemy troops .
Only by wiping out enemy troops can a battle situation be quickly resolved and cause the enemy &apos;s offensive and &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; to be smashed .
One of our Important strategies for smashing the enemy &apos;s &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; is to take advantage of every friction within the counterrevolution and vigorously widen the rift within their ranks so as to benefit our switching over to the counteroffensive and offensive .
The incident of the 19th Route Army in Fukien Province was the crux to smashing the enemy &apos;s fifth encirclement .
At that time , the CCP Central Committee adopted the correct political line of utilising this contradiction within the Kuomintang .
It concluded a cease @-@ fire agreement with the 19th Route Army so as to impel , it to oppose Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai @-@ shek .
At that time , Comrade x x and others , under the empty talk of the left , adopted an opposing policy on the strategic plane .
They did not understand at all that utilizing the 19th Route Army incident politically and militarily was an important key to smashing the enemy &apos;s fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; On the contrary , they felt that the Red Army &apos;s continuation of its activities on the eastern front and striking at the rear and flanks of Chiang Kai @-@ shekTs troops attacking the 19th Route Army was equivalent to helping the 19th Route Army .
They deployed the main force of the Red Army to the west to engage in the useless effort of attacking the blockhouses in the Yung @-@ feng &#91; 3657 0023 &#93; area and lost this precious opportunity .
They basically did not comprehend that the existence of the 19th Route Army &apos;s People &apos;s Government at that time was advantageous to us .
Striking at Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s flanks and rear in direct coordination with the 19th Route Army was precisely for our own benefit .
This was not because the 19th Route Army was a revolutionary army .
On the contrary , it was merely a faction within the counterrevolution .
This faction planned to use even more swindles and arbitrary propaganda , and even such terms as socialism , to preserve in entirety the rule of the landlord bourgeoisie .
Only by demonstrating to the worker @-@ peasant soldiers of the 19th Route Army with concrete action that we give aid to the antir @-@ Japanese , anti @-@ Chiang Kai ^ -shek struggles of any faction can we even more easily expose the swindles of the warlords of the 19th Route Army and win the soldiers over to our side in the common war against Japan and Chiang Kai @-@ shek .
Only by adopting on a military plane a policy of direct coordination with the 19th Route Army can we retain the opportunity , at that crucial point in time , to wipe out Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s main force .
This kind of condition has no precedent in the many past battles .
We did not utilize this militarily .
For the leaders of pure defense this would not be out of the ordinary , because their objective , originally , was merely to resist the enemy &apos;s advance .
As for using the frictions and contradictions within the enemy ranks to bring about our going over to the counteroffensive and the offensive was a rash move in their eyes .
Similarly , error in principle was also committed on the question of changing strategy and carrying out the breakthrough of the encirclement , The first thing we should discuss is that when we saw that the possibility of achieving decisive victory by continuing to fight along interior lines in the central Soviet area had become remote , and , finally , had become impossible ( period between May and July 1934 , that is , after the Kuang @-@ ch &apos;ang campaign ) .
We should have altered our strategic policy without any hesitation and carried out a strategic withdrawal in order to conserve the effective strength of the Red Army &apos;s main force , and sought favorable opportunities in the vast blockhouseless area for an opportune moment to go over to the counteroffensive , smash the encirclement and create new Soviet areas to protect the old .
In its 25 June cable , the Comintern pointed out in this manner : &quot; ( the resources for ) the mobilization of new armed forces in the central area have not dried up yet .
The Red Army &apos;s strength to resist and the situation in its rear area are not enough to make us panic @-@ Even speaking on the matter of the Red Army &apos;s main force in the Soviet area withdrawing , its only reason is to conserve its effective strength and avoid the possibility of being attacked by the enemy , On discussing the resolu ^ tions of the 5th Plenary Session of the Central Committee and the 13th Plenary Session of the Communist International the future prospects of the struggle and the current international situation as well as the flexible policy of the Red Army , it was , first of all , inclined toward the conservation of effective strength , to consolidate and expand under new conditions and to wait for the opportunity to launch a massive offensive against imperialism and the Kuomintang . &quot; On this crucial point it was clear that our strategic policy was also incorrect .
This question was not mentioned at all in the &quot; strategic plan for the 3 months of May , June and July . &quot; Although this problem was brought up in the &quot; &apos; Strategic plan for the 3 months of August , September and October &apos; 1 and preparations were also begun for withdrawing from the Soviet area , nevertheless , the basic principle of the new plan was still contrary to the strategic policy which should have been adopted at that time .
&quot; Use all available strength to continue with the defense of the Soviet area and win a massive victory in the campaign by doing so &quot; and &quot; launch guerrilla warfare and strengthen activities in the secondary direction to achieve a strategic change in the situation &quot; all these still remain as the second article of the first part of the basic principle of the new plan , and the question of conserving effective strength was completely ignored .
Whereas this question was the foundation of the strategic policy on which the decision to withdraw from the Soviet area rests .
The error in timing , plus the emergence of positional warfare in this campaign , caused heavy losses to the Red Army .
This kind of contradictory attitude of preparing for a breakthrough on the one hand , and , on the other , &quot; Use all available strength to continue with the defense of the central area &quot; is precisely the manifestation of the inevitable panic of leaders of the pure defense line when they arrived at the crucial moment of change .
Of even greater importance are our activities for breaking through .
In the mind &apos;s eye of Comrade Hua Fu they were basically irresolute and not combat orientated .
It was a kind of panicky running away , home moving type of
activity .
Precisely for this reason , not only was this massive changeover not conducted in accordance with the Comintern &apos;s instruction to carry out work directed at explaining the situation to the cadres and Red commanders , it was not even brought up for discussion at the Political Bureau conference .
The political objective of the mass movement of several million people was not considered to be a significant problem .
The necessary time for rest , reorganization and training was not given to the main force of the Red Army for moving from the Soviet area to the White area and for changing from positional warfare to mobile warfare , and a hasty departure was made .
They were silent from beginning to end with regard to the basic questions of what the present mission was , where they were going and why they were withdrawing from the Soviet areas .
Therefore , they were unable to heighten the enthusiasm and activism of the Red Army fighters on the &apos; -military level , and , especially , on the political level .
This cannot be but a grave error .
The huge column of the military committee and other rear echelon departmental organizations of the Army Corps caused great difficulties to the Red Army fighting on the move , turning all combat troops into a covering force , slowing down movement and losing the opportunity for reaching the pre @-@ designated area .
It was completely forgotten that the strategic switch @-@ over carried out by the Red Army would encounter serious opposition from &quot; the enemy , that in the course of the long move it would have to fight many difficult and decisive battles with all of the pursuing and blocking &apos;enemy forces before being able to arrive at its objective .
All these military , political and organizational errorst especially the fact that the strategic policy was not based upon the principle of obtaining the necessary and opportune moment to engage the enemy in decisive battle brought about a situation in which we find ourselves almost always being placed n a passive position and frequently subjected to enemy attacks and being unable to strike at the enemy with strength .
It therefore turned the 3rmonth breakthrough campaign into a covering engagement everywhere , and there were no free rein offensives taken on our own initiative .
Although &quot; preparing for combat &quot; was frequently on the lips . , in practice , we were frequently &quot; avoiding combat &quot; besides conducting covering engagements .
The &apos;morale of the Red Army could not be uplifted , there was over @-@ fatigue from being unable to get a moment &apos;s rest .
And it resulted in a decrease in personnel to an unprecedented degree .
It also caused the correct slogan of &quot; counteroffensive &quot; to become , in practice , a camouflage for the policy of avoiding combat advocated by Comrade x x and others .
There was no preparation for actually seizing victory in the counteroffensive when it became necessary .
We failed to compel the enemy to change his entire plan to attack the central Soviet area with the Red Army &apos;s change of strategy so as to protect the central area , smash the fifth &apos; &apos; encirclement and suppression , &quot; establish the Hunan base and even to conserve the effective strength of the @-@ Red Army at a high level .
All these were the unavoidable result of basically adopting avoidance of combat in the strategic policy .
This strategic avoidance of combat stems from our erroneous viewpoints .
That is to say the Red Army must first arrive at its designated area ( western Hunan Province ) , unload its baggage and then launch a counteroffensive to wipe out the enemy .
Otherwise , it would not be possible .
In the pursuit of the enemy ( _ for instance , the columns of Chou &#91; 0719 &#93; and Hsueh &#91; 5641 &#93; , they were afraid to give battle even when the enemy.became separated and they were fatigued .
The source of this kind of erroneous viewpoint lies in not understanding the fact that the current situation does not allow us to go about our task in such a simple , nonchalant and straightforward manner , as well as in overestimating the strength of the pursuing enemy .
This way of doing things might be possible in a brief situation involving inconsequential movements of small units .
But , in a situation covering several thousand li of the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &quot; and involving the massive strategic relocation of the Red Army &apos;s main force it was impossible .
Avoid battles with the enemy which are unnecessary and where no weaknesses can Be exploited .
Engagements with the enemy should not be avoided when the contrary arises .
Herein lies the main reason for the failure to accomplish their own mission in the breakthrough activities .
This error in principle kept on developing right up to the final stage of the breakthrough campaign .
When the Red Army reached the borders of Hunan and Kweichow it still acted in a mechanical manner and wanted to advance into the area of the 26th Army Corps .
They did not know how to change action guidelines with the situation that had already changed .
When the Red Army arrived in the area of Wu ^ chiang &#91; 3527 3068 &#93; , they again did not know how to delineate the task of switching over in the counter @-@ offensive in accordance with the changes in the new situation to wipe out the pursuing troops of Chiang Kai @-@ shek , but only recognize the task of wiping out a handful of the enemy in Kweichow and some so @-@ called bandits .
Although the last two errors were corrected due to the resolute opposition of the majority of the comrades in the Political Bureau , they were enough to display the habitual opportunist tendencies of Comrade Hua Fu and others with regard to strategy .
The prospects in the development of the pure defense line are : Either it would be desperate recklessness or flightism .
There could be nothing else .
The enlarged session of the Political Bureau believes that all the facts have substantiated that our line of pure defense in military matters is the principal reason for our inability to smash the enemy &apos;s fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression , ! &quot; All attempts to defend the erroneous line with regard to military leadership with the party &apos;s correct line will be futile .
The enlarged session of the Political Bureau holds that this kind of pure defense line in military affairs is a kind of concrete manifestation of right opportunism .
It rises from inadequate appraisal of enemy strength , overestimating objective difficulties , especially the difficulties of protracted campaigns and blockhouse warfare , underestimating one ? s own subjec ^ tive strength , especially the strength of the Soviet area and of the Red Army and from not understanding the characteristics of the Chinese revolutionary war .
The enlarged session of the Political Bureau holds that the struggle against the pure defense line in military matters is the concrete struggle in the party against right opportunism .
This kind of struggle should be launched and intensified in the entire party .
All attempts to turn this struggle into an unprincipled individual squabble will be severely dealt with .
Furthermore , the enlarged session of the Political Bureau holds that Comrade x x , especially Comrade Hua Fu &apos;s , method of leadership was very poor .
All the functions of the .
military committee were single @-@ handedly monopolized by Comrade Hua Fu , the collective leadership of the military committee was abolished , there was a great increase of punitivism , and self @-@ criticism was nonexistent .
Not only all differing opinions on the military plane were completely ignored but repressive measures were adopted against them , and the ingenuity , expertise and creativity of lower level commanders were stifled .
Many valuable experiences and lessons of past revolutionary battles were thrown away under the pretext of switching strategy and tactics and labeled &quot; guerrillaism . &quot; Although the majority of the comrades in the military committee have -made correct suggestions many times , and many intense debates have broken out over it , it did not affect Comrade Hua Fu and Comrade x x .
All these contributed to the abnormal phenomenon within the military committee .
At the same time , the Political Bureau believes even more so that , in the past , the Secretariat and the Political Bureau &apos;s leadership of the military committee was extremely inadequate .
The greatest part of the Secretariat &apos;s and Political Bureau &apos;s attention was focused on the huge Red Army and on matters concerning the assurance of material supply to the Red Army .
Unprecedented great results were achieved in this respect ( in these fields ) .
Very little attention was given to strategy and tactics , placing this responsibility on the shoulders of a very few comrades , mainly Comrade x x and Comrade Hua Fu .
We did not clearly understand that the question of conducting a war affects the overall situation of victory or defeat , and mistakes could turn achievements gained from the best rear area work into smoke .
The mistake the Political Bureau made on this question should be admitted .
All the comrades of the Secretariat should bear an even greater part of the responsibility because some of the important decisions or strategic plans were approved by them .
But the enlarged session of the Political Bureau especially set forth the graye errors of Comrade x x in this respect .
Representing the CCP Central Committee , he directed the work of the military committee .
With regard to the error in line committed by Comrade Hua Fu in directing battles and the abnormal phenomenon within the military committee , he not only did not correct it in a timely manner but vigorously supported and nurtured the development of this kind of error .
The enlarged session of the Political Bureau considers that Comradexx should bear the main responsibility in this respect , but Comrade x x , in his conclusion , did not admit his own errors , nor did he accept the criticism of the greatest majority of the comrades .
It must be pointed out that with regard to Comrade x x , this kind of error was not an error of the entire political line , but a partial and serious political error .
The enlarged session of the Political Bureau holds that the error committed in the past on military leadership -must be thoroughly rectified in order to smash the enemyfs encirclement campaign , create new Soviet areas and Improve the method of leadership of the military committee .
The enlarged session of the Political Bureau holds that although our past erroneous leadership in military.matters has caused us to be unable to smash the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression &apos; 1 within the central Soviet area and brought about the forced withdrawal , with partial losses , of our main force Red Army from the Soviet area .
Nevertheless , the Red Army &apos;s main force still exists .
We have the superior conditions based on the masses , the correct leadership of the party , a relatively good area with regard to materials and terrain and the support of the broad masses throughout the country .
In coordination with the victories of the Fourth Front Army and of the 26th Army Corps , plus the correct conduct of warfare , we believe all these difficulties can be overcome through the industrious efforts of the entire body of our comrades and the red commanders .
At the same time the difficulties of the enemy have increased greatly and the area of our activities has become very distant from the counterrevolutionary base of the Nanking government .
The blockhouse area , which was run by Chiang Kai @-@ shek for many years and on which he placed his reliance , is now no more .
The contradictions and disunity within the ranks of the warlords have further multiplied and the main force of our chief enemy , Chiang Kat @-@ shek , has been weakened in the fifth &quot; encirclement and suppression . &quot; The division of China by imperialism , the Kuomintang ? s policy of national betrayal and the unprecedented collapse of the national economy throughout the country have made it even more clear to the people of the nation that only the Soviet can save China , They , thereby , become even more sympathetic to the Soviet Revolution and give it support , and even directly participating in struggles on behalf of the Soviet political power .
All these are favorable conditions for smashing the enemy &apos;s new encirclement campaign , creating new Soviet bases and developing a nationwide soviet movement .
It must be pointed out , however , that the current situation has set critical tasks before the party and the Red Army , This is because at no time will imperialism and the counterrevolutionary warlords of the Kuomintang relax their drive against us .
In.the face of the new encirclement campaign we must recreate Soviet areas as there are no existing ones , and the central Red Army is not in the Yunnan @-@ Kweichow area .
Our victory must be won through arduous struggles of our own .
The creation of new Soviet areas cannot be successful without going through bloody struggle .
The current central problem is how to be victorious over the troops of Szechwan , Yunna , Kweichow and Chiang Kai @-@ shek .
The movements of the Red Army must have a high degree of flexibility in order to fight successfully against these enemies .
The basic principles of revolutionary warfare have been decided and to accomplish battle tasks it will be necessary to apply these principles in a flexible way .
The special capacity of the Red Army for mobile warfare has been considerably weakened by protracted positional warfare in the battles of the fifth encirclement , and , right now , the various levels of Red Army commanders are required to have a high level of tactical skill in mobile warfare .
The resolute and rapid change over from the tactics of positional warfare ( short , quick thrusts ) to the tactics of mobile warfare is a very serious task .
Necessary training in skills must be given to the fighters , especially the new ones .
In political work everything must meet with the
current need of the movement in order to .
guarantee the accomplishment of every combat task .
The Red Army needs even more to rest up and reorganize during battles and also to expand itself in a big way .
The Red Army should tighten up its own discipline .
It must maintain even closer relations with the broad -masses of hard working worker ^ peasant masses and become as one with them and strengthen in a big way the work of the local people .
The current situation demands that the leadership of the party and the Red Army should exert all efforts to resolve these basic questions concretely and positively .
The work of the party in the White area must be established and strengthened .
There must be a thorough change in the leadership method of the mass struggle in the White area .
The work of collapsing the White army must be launched in a positive manner .
The propagation of large @-@ scale guerrilla warfare is one of the partyTs most central tasks .
The party must hold fast to the leadership of guerrilla warfare in the central Soviet area and the Soviet areas of Hunanr @-@ Kiangsi and Hirnan @-@ Hupeh @-@ Kiangsi provinces , change past methods of work to conform with the new situation .
Finally , even more closer relationship must be established with the 26th Army Corps and the Fourth Front Army and also strengthen the leadership over them in order to achieve unified action of all the Red armies in the country and their coordination with each other .
The enlarged session of the Political Bureau believes that we can accomplish these serious tasks that have been placed before us , and their accomplishment ensures subsequent new victories in the revolution , New victories in the revolution will make our central Red Army create a new Soviet base area in the vast expanse of the three provinces of Yunnan , Kweichow and Szechwan , bring about the recovery of our old Soviet area , and the creation of a unified liaison between the Red armies in various areas with the Soviet areas .
It will also bring about a change of the struggle of the worker ^ peasant masses throughout the country into a victorious revolution .
The enlarged session of the Political Bureau believes that the Chinese Soviet Revolution , having its rich historic source , cannot be wiped out and cannot be conquered by the enemy .
The transformation of the central Soviet area , the Hunan ^ Kiangsi Soviet area and the Chekiang @-@ Kiangsi Soviet area into guerrilla areas is but a partial setback , in the overall Soviet revolution .
Such a setback is not enough to make us display alarm and panic about the progress of the Chinese Soviet Revolution .
In practice , it will not be possible even for the Kuomintang and imperialism to contemplate temporarily stopping the advance of the Soviet revolution .
The victories of the Fourth Front Army and the 26th Army Corps , the brisk activities of the Central Red Army in the three provinces of Yunnan , Kweichow and Szechwan , and the revolutionary struggle of the worker @-@ peasant masses throughout the country testify that the entire Chinese Soviet Revolution is advancing .
The enlarged session of the Political Bureau pointed out that the past errors of the party in its military leadership are but partial errors when viewed from the standpoint of the party &apos;s entire line .
This kind of error is not
enough to make us become dejected and discouraged .
The party has courageously exposed this kind of error and educated.itself to it .
It has learned how to even better lead the revolution and battle to complete victory , The party has not been weakened , but strengthened , after exposing such errors .
The enlarged session of the Political Bureau calls on all comrades to oppose with the determination of a Bolshevik , all right @-@ leaning opportunism of alarm and panic , dejection and discouragement , and , foremost , to oppose the line of pure defense .
The enlarged session , of the Political Bureau even more urgently calls on all comrades to unite to a man around the CCP Central Committee and struggle to the end for the CCP Central Committee &apos;s general line .
Victory will inevitably be ours .

ANTI @-@ JAPANESE DECLARATION FOR NATIONAL SALVATION 28 November 1935
&#91; Text &#93; Declaration to Resist Japan and Save the Nation issued by the Central Government of the Soviet People &apos;s Republic of China and the Revolutionary Military Commission of the Resist @-@ Japan Red Army of China
Workers , peasants , soldiers , students , free lances , merchants , industrialists , the Northeast Revolutionary Array , the Northeast Volunteer Army , officers and soldiers of all armed units , and fervent determined patriots !
After the four northeast provinces , comes the loss of North China , half of the nation .
Wishing to turn all the Chinese people into stateless slaves and all of China into a colony , the Japanese imperialist bandits , after annexing the four northeast provinces , are now swallowing all of North China , and even all of China .
Confronted with the destruction of the nation and extinction of the race , the Chinese people absolutely will not await death with their hands tied .
Only by a general mobilization of the army , navy , and air force and the people of all of China for a sacred anti @-@ Japanese national revolutionary war , in order to knock down Japanese imperialism and exterminate the biggest traitor in China since the beginning of history , will the nation of China gain a final and complete liberation .
The Central Government of the Soviet People &apos;s Republic of China and the Revolutionary Military Commission of the Resist @-@ Japan Red Army of China have continuously appealed to the people of the entire nation to unite and wage war against Japan .
They sent the main force of their own Red Army on a long expedition of 25,000 li , undergoing all kinds of hardships to fight Japan in the North .
The situation has become even more urgent .
Now is the time to ask the people of the entire nation to contribute their strength , money , guns , and knowledge , to unite , to struggle , and to confront the common enemies of the Chinese people with an unwavering determination ; therefore , the Central Government of the Soviet
i
People &apos;s Republic of China and the Revolutionary Military Commission of the Resist @-@ Japan Red Army of China do hereby declare to the people of the entire nation that , regardless of the political factions , armed units , social organizations , or individual classes , as long as they are willing to resist Japan , we will not only be willing to form a resist @-@ Japan combat agreement with them , but also organize with them a resist @-@ Japan coalition army and a national defense government .
For the resist @-@ Japan coalition army and the national defense government , we find the following 10 major outlines necessary .
( 1 ) Confiscate all the assets of Japanese imperialism in China for resist @-@ Japan expenses .
( 2 ) Confiscate the land and assets of traitors and spies and divide them among the workers , peasants , and disasters victims and refugees .
( 3 ) Relieve disasters and control flood ; settle the people &apos;s living .
( 4 ) Abolish all harsh levies and vexatious taxes ; develop industry and commerce .
( 5 ) Raise wages and rations ; improve the living standards of workers , soldiersa and teachers .
( 6 ) Develop education ; relieve students unable to attend school .
( 7 ) Realize democratic rights ; release all political prisoners .
( 8 ) Develop production technology ; relieve jobless intellectuals .
( 9 ) Rally the workers and peasants of Korea , Taiwan , and Japan and all anti @-@ Japanese strength to form a firm alliance .
( 10 ) Establish close , friendly relations with nations or states expressing sympathy for China &apos;s resist @-@ Japan national movement or maintaining a friendly neutrality .
The Central Government of the Soviet People &apos;s Republic of China and the Revolutionary Military Commission of the Resist @-@ Japan Red Army of China appeal to the people of the entire nation to support our proposal and immediately send delegates to discuss the concrete measures .
We believe that , as long as we can realize this proposal with one mind and by concerted effort , the final victory is ours .

&quot; On the United FrontOur Proposal to Resist Japan and Save the Nation in the Past Year &quot; mimeographed ( - * hand copied ) , January 1937
ORDER NO 2 OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OF THE CHINESE SOVIET REPUBLIC
15 December 1935
&#91; Text &#93; In view of the active aggression by Japanese imperialism and the urgency of China &apos;s situation , the workers , peasants , and patriots of the entire nation are actively participating in the national revolutionary struggle and resisting the Japanese aggressors and their running dogs , Chiang Kai @-@ shek and his gang .
As a result of the rule of traitor Chiang Kai @-@ shek and others , China &apos;s economy has sunk into a hopeless state , especially the rural economy , and the peasants of the entire nation have risen to resist and riot .
The rich peasants have changed their attitude of hostility toward the soviet revolution and begun to show sympathy for the anti @-@ imperialist and land revolutionary struggles .
To expand the national revolutionary front to resist Japan and punish Chiang , the Soviet Central Committee has decided to revise the policy on the rich peasants .
( A ) In regard to the land of the rich peasants , except the portion leased to tenants at a feudalistic high rent which must be confiscated similar to the land of the landlords , the land farmed by the rich peasants themselves or by hired help , regardless of the quality of the soil , will not be confiscated .
( B ) The movable assets and the domestic animals and farm tools of the rich peasants , except items used for feudalistic usury , leasing , and exploitation of the peasants , will not be confiscated .
( C ) Besides the unified graduated taxes , the local governments may not impose levies or special taxes on the rich peasants .
( D ) Where the laws of the Soviet are not violated , the governments of all levels must protect the freedom of the rich peasants to engage in industry and commerce and to hire labor .
( E ) In areas ( prefectures ) where all the land is equally divided by demand of the greatest majority of the masses , the rich peasants have the right to the same shares as the ordinary peasants .
( F ) The rich peasants must be punished according to law when they violate the laws and orders of the Soviet ; when they perform counterrevolutionary activities , they must be punished according to the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries .
( G ) The rich peasants still have no right to join the Red Army or any of the armed units ( including the Red Guard ) , nor the right to vote .
( H ) The Land Law and all other laws and orders promulgated previously which conflict with this order are hereby abolished .
( I ) This order becomes effective on the day of its promulgation ( in noncontiguous areas , on the day of its receipt ) .
All decisions rendered according to previous laws before this order becomes effective will remain valid .
There may be no reversal .

DECLARATION OF THE SOVIET CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TO THE INNER MONGOLIAN PEOPLE 20 December 1935
&#91; Text &#93; Dear people of Inner Mongolia !
Currently we are at the critical moment of world changes .
Are you willing to submit to the slaughtering and cutting by Japanese imperialism and Chinese warlords , become their cannon fodder , and perish , or will you rise to the occasion , vigorously exert yourselves , and strive for complete equality of the supreme Mongolian people with the nations of the world ?
You must choose between the two , and we hope you will decide promptly .
To occupy all of China , the ambitious and arrogant Japanese imperialism must first take Manchuria and Mongolia ; to gain world supremacy , it must first occupy China .
This barbarous scheme is now being gradually realized , and the first to suffer the consequences are the people of the Three Northeast Provinces and the five North China provinces and the entire nation of Inner Mongolia .
The cunning and despicable Japanese bandits , with their sweet words and evil intent , are resorting to all kinds of fraudulent measures and borrowing &quot; Great Mongolianism &quot; to attain their goal of taking over all the land and assets of Mongolia and enslaving the entire people of Inner Mongolia .
They are preparing to turn your soil into a battlefield and your people into cannon fodder in order to achieve their goal of attacking the Chinese Soviet People &apos;s Republic , invading the Outer Mongolian People &apos;s Republic and the Soviet Union , and finally destroying the Mongolian nation .
If you do not believe this , you only have to look at the people of the three provinces of Korea and Taiwan who cannot use their own language , who have no freedom of residence , movement , farming , or raising livestock , and whose political and economic powers are entirely controlled by the Japanese .
If you will then look at the military defense and military installations of Japanese imperialism in Chahar and its Hsing @-@ an Head Office and all its other conspiracies , you will clearly see the unprecedented crisis confronting the nation of Inner Mongolia .
Then there are also the Chinese warlords headed by the shameless Chiang Kai @-@ shek who not only consider themselves the suzerain but have even designated the entire region of Inner Mongolia a province and driven the Mongolian people to
an area south of the Yellow River and north of the Yin @-@ shan mountains , and constantly order minor warlords Ching Hsiuyueh and Kao Shih @-@ hsiu to take the pastures and salt ponds , in order to destroy gradually the Mongolian nation , serve as the road cleaners of Japanese imperialism , and hasten the end of Inner Mongolia .
In the several years of courageous fighting , the Central Government of the Chinese Soviet People &apos;s Republic and the brave Red Army units have dealt innumerable severe blows to Japanese imperialism and warlord Chiang Kai @-@ shek .
The Chinese Red Army has become an invincible force , especially the courageous Central Red Army .
After an expedition of 25,000 li , it broke the world march record and successfully fulfilled the plan to resist Japan in the North .
The fighting goal of the Chinese Red Army is not only to liberate the entire nation of China from the oppression of imperialism and the warlords , but similarly to struggle for the emancipation of other weak nations , and primarily it must help solve the national issue of Inner Mongolia .
We feel that only when the nation of Inner Mongolia joins us in our fight before it can preserve the glory of the Genghis Khan era , avoid national perdition , step on to the road of national recoverya and gain independence and liberty similar to the nations of Turkey , Poland , the Ukraine , and the Caucasus .
Therefore , this government declares to you :
( 1 ) The entire area of the original 6 mengs , 24 pu &apos;s , and 49 banners of Inner Mongolia , the 2 pu &apos;s of Chahar and T &apos;u @-@ mo @-@ tTe , and the 3 special banners of Ninghsia , whether changed to county jurisdiction or deemed grassy plains , must be returned to the people of Inner Mongolia and considered the territory of the nation of Inner Mongolia .
The names and administrative organizations of the provinces of Jehol , Chahar , and Suiyuan must be abolished , and no other nation may occupy or seize under any excuse the territory of the nation of Inner Mongolia .
( 2 ) We feel that the people of Inner Mongolia have the right to solve all their internal problems , and no one has the authority to interfere by force in their living , habits , religion , ethics , and all other rights .
Meanwhile , the nation of Inner Mongolia may organize according to its own desire .
It may , according to the principle of self @-@ determination , organize its own life and form its own government .
It has the right to form alliances with other nations .
It also has the right to establish its separate entity .
In sum , the nation is supreme , and all nations are equal .
( 3 ) All the Chinese , Moslem , and Manchurian nationals in Inner Mongolia must , according to the principle of national equality , develop democracy , so that all such minorities will receive the same treatment as the Inner Mongolians , and they must have the freedoms of language , religion , and residence .
( 4 ) First of all , Pao @-@ t &apos;u @-@ wan occupied by Ching Hsiu @-@ yueh , the area occupied by Kao Shih @-@ hsiu , and the two salt ponds must be returned to the Inner Mongolian people , and the vicinity of the Great Wall , such areas as Ning @-@ t &apos;iao @-@ liang , An @-@ pien , and Ting @-@ pien , must be designated as a commercial zone , in order to develop trade between us .
( 5 ) Our Worker and Peasant Red Army guerrillas , or any other armed unit , has absolutely no intention to attack the grassy plains , but neither should you permit transit of the troops of the Chinese warlords and Japanese imperialism through the grassy plains to attack us and hasten your own perdition .
We wish to unite with you and form a defense and offense alliance , in order to knock down our common enemies .
In sum , as long as you realize the necessity of the liberation of the Mongolian nation , refuse to become people without a country , and have the determination to resist Japanese imperialism and the warlords of Chiang Kai @-@ shekTs China , then , regardless of whether you are aristocrats or ordinary citizens , we will render you friendly and substantial aid .
The Mongolian people have always been known to the world for their courage and fighting ability .
We believe that , once you consciously organize , wage a national revolutionary war , and oust Japanese imperialism and the Chinese warlords from the territory of Inner Mongolia , no one will have the audacity to claim that it is easy to take advantage of the sons of Genghis Khan .
Please think it over carefully .
And it is hoped that we will mutually send delegates to discuss our great cause .
It is so declared .

* &quot; Analysis of the Current Situation , &quot; Theory and Practice Press , 1935
RESOLUTION ON CURRENT POLITICAL SITUATION AND PARTY TASKS Passed by the Chinese Communist Party Central Politburo
25 December 1935 - .
:
&#91; Text &#93; I.
Nature of the Current Situation
A fundamental change has occurred in the current political situation , demarcating a new era in China &apos;s revolutionary history .
The manifestations are the attempt of Japanese imperialism to turn China into a colony , the pending expansion of China1s revolution into a great nationwide revolution , and the imminence of the world revolution and war .
After annexing the four Northeast provinces , Japanese imperialism has now occupied all of North China and is preparing to swallow all of China , in order to turn China from the semi @-@ colony of the various imperialists into Japan &apos;s colony .
This is the basic characteristic of the current situation .
As the open and armed occupation of the four Northeast provinces aroused the anti @-@ Japanese anger of the whole of China , Japanese imperialism has adopted a more subtle approach .
It utilizes the Kuomintang Nanking government to issue orders and appoint certain Chinese traitor warlords and politicians as its agents in North China , with the intention of eventual direct armed occupation .
Though the means is more cunning and vicious than that of &quot; 18 September , &quot; it is merely a transition stage to direct armed occupation and the establishment of a nation of North China and its puppet government .
A second puppet Manchukuo government will be the inevitable outcome .
The many warlords and politicians , rich gentry , compradors , and capitalists , constituting the major components of China &apos;s traitor clique , especially the pro @-@ Japan factions among them , will serve as the constituents and supporters of the puppet government .
Without this large group of spies and traitors , Japanese imperialism will not find it so easy to turn China into its colony .
By its act of annexing North China and preparing to swallow the entire China , Japanese imperialism brings the great calamity of the loss of the nation and the destruction of the race to the 400 million Chinese people .
This calamity forces all the Chinese who are unwilling to lose their country or to serve as spies and traitors to the only path available to them ; they have to launch a sacred national war against Japanese imperialism and its running dogs , the spies and traitors .
To defend their own nation , all patriotic Chinese people will fight the bloody war to the final end .
This is the inevitable response to the venture of Japanese imperialism to destroy the nation and race of another country .
After swallowing the four northeast provinces , a relatively small bomb , Japanese imperialism begins to swallow China proper , a gigantic bomb .
The act of Japanese imperialism to swallow China singlehandedly has aggravated the internal conflicts of imperialism to an unprecedented extent .
For its own goal , imperialism absolutely cannot tolerate Japan .
A Pacific war is inevitable .
Meanwhile , Great Britain wishes to acquire certain concessions and compromises from Japan so that it can devote its main force to its major enemies , the Soviet Union , America , and Italy .
The act of Japanese imperialism to swallow China has promoted the weakening and collapse of China &apos;s counterrevolutionary regime , first of all the regime of Chiang Kai @-@ shek , the chief traitor .
Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s consistent traitorous policy has not only caused him to lose certain social and mass bases , but also reduced his territory .
His long struggle against the soviet , especially the five &quot; encirclements &quot; and his pursuit of the Central Red Army , has consumed , exhausted , and dispersed his forces .
The dream of a fascist unification of China has declared final bankruptcy .
The Fifth Kuomintang National Congress was actually a loot dividing conference unfavorable to Chiang Kai @-@ shek .
He can only rely more on betraying China to maintain his dying control , while such betrayal further hastens the destruction of his rule .
This situation aggravates further the contradictions and conflicts between the Chiang faction warlords and other warlords and increases the possibility of a war against Chiang on a new status of a new nature .
The act of Japanese imperialism to swallow China occurs precisely at the time when China &apos;s soviet movement is shifting to a new situation .
Since the Central Red Army withdrew from the central soviet area and certain soviet areas along the lower Yangtze suffered partial losses , with the new victories won by the Red Army on all fronts , the creation of new bases , the shift of the guerrilla war in the old soviet areas into counteroffensive , and the vigorous development of the new guerrilla warfare , the difficult time has passed .
After a long march of 25,000 li stretching over 12 months , the Central Red Army defeated Chiang Kai @-@ shek1s pursuit , declared the bankruptcy of the encirclement , pursuit , blockade , and interception of imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai @-@ shek , broke the long march record of history , pointed out , by means of the
propaganda teams , the way to relieve misery and save the nation to more than 200 million people in the 11 provinces traversed by it , and , like a seeder , scattered the seed of revolution .
The smashing of the third enemy &quot; encirclement &quot; in the Shensi and Kansu soviet areas after the Central Red Army effected a junction with the 25th , 26th , and 27th Armies , demonstrated even more clearly the arrival of the new period of the soviet movement .
In combination with the current new general revolutionary situation , it becomes an important component of the new situation of China &apos;s revolution .
It points out that the ironclad strength of the Soviet Red Army exists in the great strengths of the Chinese people to resist Japanese imperialism and save China from the calamity of losing the nation and the race .
The act of Japanese imperialism to swallow China has again awakened the Chinese people , made them realize the critical situation of the pending calamity , and stirred up a national revolutionary high tide .
This high tide has been created after innumerable temperings in China &apos;s revolutionary history ( mainly the great revolution of 1925 @-@ 1927 ) ; it has been created when China already has its soviet revolutionary bases and the existence of a revolutionary situation ; it has been created under the pending new cycle of a world revolution and war ; it has been created when the Soviet Union already has the strength to overcome all the aggressive nations and aid the oppressed people .
Therefore , it is extremely widespread and firm , and produces an interaction with the world revolution by mutually influencing and mutually aiding each other .
Undoubtedly , the new anti @-@ Japanese national revolutionary high tide has not only awakened the more backward strata of the workers and peasants in the nation and caused them to participate actively in the revolutionary struggle , but also attracted the broad petty bourgeois masses and the intellectuals to the revolution .
The total collapse of China &apos;s national economy , the millions who have lost their jobs or land , and the millions of disaster victims and refugees have closely linked the new anti @-@ Japanese national revolutionary high tide with the daily struggles of the masses for salvation and survival and greatly expanded the stronghold of the national revolution and its mass foundation .
The revolutionary wrath of the broad masses is fermenting in all areas of China , and begins to manifest itself again in the anti @-@ Japanese demonstrations of the students in the large cities .
In the counterrevolutionary stronghold , there are new vacillations , splits , and conflicts .
A part of the national bourgeoisie , many rural rich peasants and small landlords , and even some of the warlords have become sympathetically neutral toward the budding new national movement , with the possibility of participation .
The national revolutionary front has expanded .
Today &apos;s world is on the eve of a great revolution and a great war .
The economic crisis of all the imperialist nations and the resulting revolutionary crisis make it impossible for imperialism to find another way to save the situation except war .
Doubtlessly the danger of a second
imperialist world war exists in Japanese imperialism &apos;s large @-@ scale attack of China and Italian imperialism &apos;s aggression of Abyssinia .
Meanwhile , the national revolutionary wars waged by China and Abyssinia and the maturing of the revolutionary crisis in the imperialist nations and their colonies will doubtlessly lead to a world revolution .
Currently , on the eve of revolution and war , we can clearly see the weakening of the world counterrevolutionary strengths and the rise of the world revolutionary strengths .
In the future , the world war and world revolution will put an end to all the counterrevolutions in the world .
Under such a situation , China &apos;s revolution is no longer isolated as in the past .
The world revolution is an effective aid to China &apos;s revolution , while the latter has become a great factor in the world revolution .
In the future , China will aid the world revolution with the noble position of the entire nation .
The same principle applies to the relationship between Japan and China .
Under the leadership of the powerful Japanese Communist Party , Japan &apos;s workers and peasants and the oppressed nations ( Korea and Taiwan ) are preparing to struggle for the overthrow of Japanese imperialism and the building of a soviet Japan .
Thus , China &apos;s revolution and Japan &apos;s revolution are joined under the common goal of &quot; knocking down Japanese imperialism . &quot; Japan &apos;s revolutionary people are the effective helpers of China &apos;s revolutionary people .
The situation is the same with the Soviet Union .
Today &apos;s Soviet Union has the strength to overcome the imperialists which have the audacity to provoke it ( the Second Five @-@ Year Plan nearing completion ; the power of the Red Army ) .
When all the peaceful means toward Japanese imperialism are ineffective ( several proposals to form a mutual nonaggression pact ) and Japan actively provokes the Soviet Union , the latter is ready to hit the aggressor .
Thus , China &apos;s revolution , Japan &apos;s revolution , and the Soviet Union &apos;s struggle against the aggressor are joined on the foundation of a common goalknocking down Japanese imperialism , and the Soviet Union becomes the most effective aid to China &apos;s revolution .
China &apos;s revolution has a favorable environment and a brilliant future .
Nevertheless , its main enemy , imperialism , especially the ferocious and arrogant Japanese imperialism at present , is prepared to confront it with determination and strength .
In regard to China &apos;s counterrevolutionary group , as its ruling force is weakened more than ever before , it has no choice but to render greater service to the vicious tiger , rely on the wicked Japanese imperialism , and launch a desperate attack on the revolutionary people .
When we consider the unbalanced development between this situation and China &apos;s revolution currently still in existence , we know that China &apos;s revolution has endurance .
It points out to China &apos;s revolutionary people and their leader , the Communist Party , that they must be prepared for a long @-@ term war against the enemy and to be ready for hard work !
Without tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of revolutionary soldiers , it will not be possible to bring about the final liquidation of the enemy .
All strategies and all effort must be directed
toward organizing millions of people into the great national revolutionary battlefield .
To prepare a great force is to prepare for the victory of the final battle .
The PartyTs Strategy and Line
The current situation tells us that the act of Japanese imperialism to swallow China has shaken the entire nation and the whole world .
The relations among the political parties of all classes and strata in China &apos;s political life and the armed forces have again changed , or are in the process of changing .
The national revolutionary front and the national counterrevolutionary front are in the process of yet another reorganization .
Therefore , the party &apos;s strategy and line are to activate , rally , and organize all the revolutionary strengths of the entire nation to resist Japanese imperialism , the major enemy at the present time , and traitor Chiang Kai @-@ shek .
Regardless of who they are , what factions , what armed units , or what classes , as long as they oppose Japanese imperialism and traitor Chiang Kai @-@ shek , they must all be rallied together to launch a sacred national revolutionary war , expel Japanese imperialism out of China , knock down , the control of the Japanese imperialist running dogs , gain the thorough liberation of the Chinese nation , and preserve its independence and territorial integrity .
Only the most extensive anti @-@ Japanese national united front ( the lower and the upper strata ) will overcome Japanese imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai @-@ shek .
Naturally , the different individuals , different organizations , different social classes and strata , and different armed units will have their different motives and standpoints in the anti @-@ Japanese national revolution .
Some wish to maintain their existing position , others wish to gain the leadership power of the movement and limit the movement within the realm permissible by them , and still others truly strive for the thorough liberation of the nation of China .
Precisely because of such different motives and standpoints , some of them will vacillate or rebel right at the beginning of the struggle , others may become negative halfway and withdraw from the front , and there are those who wish to struggle to the bitter end .
Nevertheless , our task is to rally not only all possible anti @-@ Japanese basic strengths , but all possible anti @-@ Japanese allies ; it is to ask the people of the entire nation to contribute their strength , money , guns , and knowledge , so that not one patriotic Chinese is left out of the anti @-@ Japanese front .
It is the party &apos;s most extensive national united front , and the general line of its strategy .
Only by this line will we mobilize the strengths of the people of the entire nation against the common enemy of all the people , Japanese imperialism , and traitor chief Chiang Kai @-@ shek .
China &apos;s worker class and the peasants remain the fundamental motive power of its revolution .
The broad petty bourgeois masses and the revolutionary intellectuals are the reliable allies in the national revolution .
A firm alliance between the workers and peasants and the petty bourgeoisie
constitutes the basic strength to overcome Japanese imperialism and the spies and traitors .
In regard to a part of the national bourgeoisie and warlords , no matter how much they disagree with the land revolution and the soviet system , if they are sympathetic with or adopt a friendly neutrality toward the struggle against Japan and the spies and traitors , or if they directly participate in the struggle , it is favorable to the deployment of the anti @-@ Japanese front , because it serves to weaken the total counterrevolutionary strength and increase the total revolutionary strength .
To attain this goal , the party must adopt all kinds of suitable methods or patterns to win them over to the resist @-@ Japan front .
Not only thus , but even in the stronghold of the landlord and comprador classes &apos; , they are not all unanimous .
As a result of the competitions among many imperialists in China in the past , various traitor groups have emerged , with conflicts and contradictions among them .
The party must also resort to many means so that certain counterrevolutionary forces will temporarily take the position of not actively opposing the anti @-@ Japanese front .
The same strategy must apply to imperialists other than Japan .
When activating , rallying , and organizing the strengths of the people of the entire China in order to resist their common enemies , the party must firmly and steadfastly struggle against all tendencies of vacillation , compromise , surrender , and rebellion within the united anti @-@ Japanese front .
All those sabotaging the anti @-@ Japanese movement of the Chinese people are spies and traitors , and we must all rise and attack them .
The Communist Party must , by its own positive , thorough , and correct anti @-@ Japanese , anti @-@ spy , and anti @-@ traitor words and deeds , gain the leadership power of the anti @-@ Japanese front .
And only under the leadership of the Communist Party will the anti @-@ Japanese movement achieve thorough victory .
In regard to the broad masses on the anti @-@ Japanese front , their demands involving their basic interest must be satisfied ( the demand of the peasants for land ; the demand of the workers , poor people , soldiers , and intellectuals for improvement of their life ) .
Only when their demands are met can the broad masses be mobilized to the anti @-@ Japanese battlefield , the anti @-@ Japanese movement acquire endurance , and the movement march toward total victory .
Only thus can the party gain leadership power in the anti @-@ Japanese movement .
The National Defense Government and the Resist @-@ Japan Allied Army
The most extensive and the supreme form of the national united front against Japan and the traitors consists of the National Defense Government and the Resist @-@ Japan Allied Army .
In view of the existence of sentiments unfavorable to the soviet system and the land revolution but favorable to the movement against Japan and the traitors , the situation of local Balkanization resulting from political and economic imbalance , the partial territorial success of the Chinese soviet political power at the present time , and the gravity of the acts of the spies and traitors , the national counterrevolutionaries , in their roles as accomplices to
Japanese imperialism , the organization of the National Defense Government and Resist @-@ Japan Allied Army is not only feasible , but necessary .
The Chinese people adopt many different patterns to resist Japan and the traitors , and the degree of awareness of those participating in the anti @-@ Japanese movement is not the same .
The Communist Party members must seize all opportunities to activate , organize , and lead the struggles of all patterns and all degrees and channel them to the stage of the National Defense Government and the Resist @-@ Japan Allied Army .
All anti @-@ Japanese and anti @-@ traitor elements , regardless of which class , which political faction , which social organization , or which armed unit they represent , may join the National Defense Government and the Resist @-@ Japan Allied Army .
The National Defense Government is the political power organization of the united front of all the anti @-@ Japanese and anti @-@ traitor strength throughout China and the united leadership organ of the anti @-@ Japanese and anti @-@ traitor national revolutionary war .
In the class sense , it is an alliance of all classes under the common goal to resist Japan and the traitors .
To organize the National Defense Government and the Resist @-@ Japan Allied Army promptly , and to give this government and army a broader mass foundation and greater armed strengths , the strategy of the Communist Party is not to wait for the spontaneous emergence of the anti @-@ Japanese people &apos;s organizations and anti @-@ Japanese armed strength before organizing them , but to direct its own members to activate all the patriotic elements and all the organizational , class , stratum , factional , production and mercantile , cultural and educational , student and teacher , modern and old fashioned , social and political , worker @-@ peasant and petty bourgeois , national bourgeois , urban , rural , and armed strengths , initiate all kinds and types of anti @-@ Japanese and anti @-@ spy and traitor organizations ( resist @-@ Japan association , anti @-@ Japanese federation , etc . ) , organize all kinds and types of anti @-@ Japanese and anti @-@ traitor troops ( resist @-@ Japan volunteer army . , the New 19th Route Army of the People &apos;s Revolutionary Army , etc . ) , and form political power structures ( resist @-@ Japan governments of the counties , districts , and cities , the people &apos;s revolutionary government , etc . ) * When such organizations , troops , and political power structures are assembled , and the strengths of the soviet and the Red Army added to them , we will have the organizations of the National Defense Government and the Resist @-@ Japan Allied Army .
After the formation of the National Defense Government and the Resist @-@ Japan Allied Army , we must , every day , activate new organizations , new local governments , and new troops , continuously eliminate the vacillating and renegade elements , and continuously absorb new strengths , so that the National Defense Government and the Resist @-@ Japan Allied Army will become a government and an army which , instead of decadent , are vigorous and , instead of weak . , possess a tremendous combat strength .
As for some areas where resist @-@ Japan governments and resist @-@ Japan allied forces have sprung up freely without undergoing the party &apos;s activation and guidance due to the weakness of the party &apos;s strength in such areas , or without the
participation of the soviet and the Red Army due to their distance , the party organizations in such areas must actively aid , support , and participate in them .
This is the concrete work line of the Communist Party to realize the National Defense Government and the Resist @-@ Japan Allied Army .
As the National Defense Government and the Resist @-@ Japan Allied Army are the most extensive and the supreme form of the organization of the national united front against Japan and the traitors , they must possess the most extensive action outline .
The outline is as follows :
Resist Japan and save the nation ; recover lost territory .
Confiscate all the assets of Japanese imperialism in China for resist @-@ Japan expenses .
Confiscate the land and assets of all the traitors and spies and divide them among the workers , peasants and disaster victims and refugees .
Relieve disasters and control flood ; settle the people &apos;s living .
Abolish all harsh levies and vexatious taxes ; develop industry and commerce .
Raise wages and rations ; improve the living standards of workers , soldiers , and teachers .
7 . Develop education ; relieve students unable to attend school .
8 . Realize democratic rights ; release all political prisoners .
9 . Develop production technology ; relieve jobless intellectuals .
Rally the workers , peasants , and all oppressed masses of Korea , Taiwan , and Japan to form a firm alliance .
Establish close friendly relations with nations or states expressing sympathy for China &apos;s national movement or maintaining a friendly neutrality .
The Communist Party must , in the process of the resist @-@ Japan struggle , seek the realization of these outlines and , through these outlines , the realization of the party &apos;s 10 great outlines .
The Soviet People &apos;s Republic
The most extensive united front against Japan and the traitors has its special significance today ; it is the success of the soviet in many areas in China , which is fundamentally different from the period of the great revolution of 1925 @-@ 1927 .
The success of the soviet movement led
by the Communist Party in many areas in China in the past 9 years has supplied a fundamental strength to the new anti @-@ imperialist high tide , given hope to the people of all the nation , furnished live examples of seizing freedom , liberation , and independence from the hands of imperialism and traitors , laid the firmest foundation and base for the most extensive national united front , guaranteed the endurance and eventual thorough victory of the new great revolution , and provided the central support to the National Defense Government and the Resist @-@ Japan Allied Army .
To gain a broad and powerful foundation for the national united front , the Soviet Worker @-@ Peasant Republic and its Central Government declare that its name is hereby changed to the Soviet People &apos;s Republic and that many parts of its policies , which are the policies of the Soviet Worker @-@ Peasant Republic , are revised for better adaptation to the situation of resisting Japanese imperialism in its attempt to turn China into a colony .
Such revisions primarily manifest more fully that the soviet represents not only the workers and peasants , but the nation of China .
The fundamental interest of the nation of China is the freedom , independence , and unity of China , and only under the firm policy of the soviet will such fundamental interest be gained and safeguarded and the enemies to such interest , imperialism and traitors , thoroughly overcome .
The Soviet People &apos;s Republic declares that it is willing to rally the broad petty bourgeois masses around itself and that it is willing to grant the rights to vote and to be elected to all the revolutionary petty bourgeois elements .
The soviet will protect , as far as possible by its policies and powers , all the urban and rural small industry and commerce hit by imperialism and ChinaTs counterrevolution .
The soviet has long abolished all the harsh levies and vexatious taxes imposed by the Kuomintang warlords and promulgated the unified graduated tax favorable to the small producers .
The Soviet People &apos;s Republic declares that all intellectuals sympathetic to the anti @-@ Japanese and anti @-@ traitor movement , whether they were Kuomintang members or worked for the Kuomintang government in the past , will enjoy favorable treatment from the soviet government .
The soviet will give them work , relieve their unemployment , and furnish them the opportunity to develop their talent in culture , education , art , science , and technology .
The soviet will grant refuge to all the intellectuals , writers , artists , scientists , technical personnel , and newspaper reporters who have been expelled , scorned , or mistreated by Japanese imperialism or the traitorous Kuomintang government .
( All of them may come to the soviet areas . ) The soviet will grant the rights to vote and to be elected to all the revolutionary intellectuals , writers , artists , scientists , technical personnel , and newspaper reporters ( regardless of whether they are of landlord , rich peasant , or capitalist background ) .
The Soviet PeopleTs Republic declares that all White array officers ( regardless of rank ) and soldiers who are willing to resist Japan and the traitors will have the right to receive favorable treatment from the soviet , and that the Soviet Red Army is willing to give work to all the unemployed soldiers rejected or disarmed by the traitorous Kuomintang government .
Even those who once fought against the Red Army , once they lay down their arms , be they officers or soldiers , will receive favorable treatment .
All the injured will receive medical attention .
The soviet will grant the rights to vote and to be elected to all those White army officers and soldiers who wish to serve in the Red Army and are loyal to the cause against Japanese imperialism and its running dogs the traitors .
The Soviet People &apos;s Republic and its Red Army propose to all the individuals , organizations , political factions , and armed units in the entire nation which wish to participate in the cause against Japanese imperialism and its running dogs the traitors to organize together the National Defense Government and the Resist @-@ Japan Allied Army .
Regardless of what kind of armed units , the soviet and the Red Army are willing to form an agreement with them to resist Japan and punish the traitors , similar to the resist @-@ Japan anti @-@ Chiang agreement formed between the Soviet Red Army and the 19th Route Army in the past .
However , in the past , the Red Army was unable to render direct substantial aid promptly to the 19th Route Army ( nor did the 19th Route Army make a positive request ) to repel Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s attack of Fukien , which was wrong .
Hereafter , substantial aid must be rendered , as much as possible , to all the friendly units resisting Japan and punishing the traitors until the stage of direct combat coordination .
To reach the goal of resisting the common enemies , the Soviet Red Army needs the victory and development not only of itself , but also of its friendly allied units .
The Soviet People &apos;s Republic revises its policy on the rich peasants .
The assets of the rich peasants will not be confiscated .
Except that part used for feudal exploitation , their land , whether farmed by themselves or by hired help , will not be confiscated .
When all the land in a village is equally divided , the rich peasants have the right to the same shares as the poor and middle peasants .
The Soviet People &apos;s Republic adopts a policy more lenient than before toward the national industrial and commercial capitalists .
Where it is beneficial to both sides , it welcomes them to invest in the territory of the Soviet People &apos;s Republic and establish plants and stores , and it will protect their property and reduce the taxes as much as possible , in order to develop China &apos;s economy .
In areas occupied by the Red Army , all industry and commerce beneficial to the anti @-@ Japanese and anti @-@ traitor movement will be protected so that the people of the entire nation will understand that the Soviet People &apos;s Republic not only safeguards political freedom but is the best place to develop China &apos;s industry and commerce .
The Soviet People &apos;s Republic declares to the overseas Chinese that it commends them for their patriotic activities in aid of China &apos;s revolution and that , though those like Chiang Kai @-@ shek have long deserted the revolution , the Soviet People &apos;s Republic and the patriotic people of the entire nation have continued the courageous cause since the Taiping Rebellion and are determined to save China from destruction and turn it into a powerful and prosperous nation .
The day of the national victory of the Soviet People &apos;s Republic is the time of the liberation of the overseas Chinese .
All the policies whereby the Kuomintang government led the overseas Chinese to slavery must be thoroughly eradicated , and replaced with policies of active protection of the overseas Chinese .
The soviet grants the privilege of refuge to all the overseas Chinese compatriots currently rejected or expelled by Japanese imperialism and other imperialist nations , and it welcomes overseas Chinese capitalists to develop industry and commerce in the soviet areas .
All the policy revisions are for one fundamental goal : Overcome Japanese imperialism and its running dogs the traitors , seek the freedom . , liberation , and independence of the nation of China , and strive for the national victory of the revolution .
To implement the policies successfully , to fight Japanese imperialism promptly , and to safeguard the leadership power of the national united front , the party and the soviet have a policy which has always been consistent but which requires a greater effort to make it more adapted to the needs of the national united front .
It is to expand the Resist @-@ Japan Red Army , to expand the resist @-@ Japan guerrilla , to expand the territory of the Soviet People &apos;s Republic serving as the resist @-@ Japan base , to smash the offensive of the traitor troops , to cleanse the resist @-@ Japan path , to consolidate the resist @-@ Japan rears to thoroughly solve the land issue , to recruit the majority of the workers and peasants , to win over the traitor troops and Japanese imperialist soldiers , to propose to the minorities the formation of an alliance for common struggle , and to implement a flexible foreign policy .
The Red Army is the resist @-@ Japan vanguard .
Only the expansion , consolidation , and proper employment of this vanguard will assure the success of the anti @-@ Japanese war .
Today , the slogan to &quot; struggle for the expansion of a 1 @-@ million @-@ strong Red Army &quot; must be closely linked to the urgent anti @-@ Japanese war to avert destruction .
To overcome Japanese imperialism and its running dogs China &apos;s traitors , the Red Army must be expanded to several million .
But first it must be expanded to 1 million .
The positive effort toward this goal of not only every Red director , soldier , local cadre , and soviet personnel , but also the revolutionary people of the entire nation , is most important .
The elevation of the technical conditions of the Red Army , the improvement of technical and tactical education , the intensification and popularization of political work , the centralization of the leadership of the Revolutionary Military Affairs Commission , the assurance of material supply , and especially the
conformity of the strategy and battle direction with the correct principles ( opposing adventurism when on the offensive ; opposing conservatism when on the defensive ; opposing escape @-@ ism when shifting ) are all indispensable conditions for victory .
Guerrilla warfare must be developed in the entire country , while stressing the areas occupied by Japanese imperialism and their vicinities , areas under traitor Chiang Kai @-@ shek , and the resist @-@ Japan bases ( soviet areas ) of the Red Army and their vicinities .
All guerrilla troops must emerge as a part of the national war and closely link themselves with the land revolution of the peasant masses .
Guerrilla warfare must be made to produce a great strategic effect in the anti @-@ Japanese anti @-@ traitor struggle .
The party must make the guerrilla units the creators of resist @-@ Japan bases ( soviet areas ) ; it must make all areas where the guerrilla troops are present establish resist @-@ Japan people &apos;s revolutionary political power ( county , district , and township resist @-@ Japan governments , revolutionary committees , and even Soviets ) severed from Japanese imperialism and the traitorous control ; it must make the guerrilla expand rapidly and become a resist @-@ Japan revolutionary army ; it must make the young students and revolutionary soldiers engulfed in the anti @-@ Japanese tidal wave join guerrilla warfare in large numbers ; it must unite all the guerrilla units , whether currently under the party &apos;s leadership or not , on a common foundation .
It will not be possible to succeed in overcoming Japanese imperialism and its running dogs China &apos;s traitors without expanding the territory of the Soviet People &apos;s Republic , i.e. , the Red Army bases .
Only when large sections of land controlled by the traitors are turned into soviet territory will the Red Army have a backing and the resist @-@ Japan war its rear .
We must strive for perfection in the many tasks within the soviet territory , enforce the correct policies , make the soviet territory impregnable and an area admired , cherished , and emulated by the people of the entire nation .
All attempts of the traitor troops to attack the resist @-@ Japan bases and model areas of the people &apos;s political power must be ruthlessly repelled , smashed , and destroyed .
To repel such counterrevolutionary attacks is the responsibility of not only the Resist @-@ Japan Red Army and the anti @-@ Japanese people of the soviet areas , but also the anti @-@ Japanese people of the entire nation .
The party must appeal to all the anti @-@ Japanese people of all of China and of all the soviet areas to struggle in defense of their own bases , to resist the traitors &apos; sabotage of the rear of the resist @-@ Japan war , and to oppose the blocking of the Red Army by the traitors .
Linking the civil war of China with the national war is a fundamental principle of the party &apos;s guidance of the revolutionary war .
It will be impossible to succeed in overcoming Japanese imperialism and its running dogs the traitors without the participation of the majority
of the millions of workers , peasants , soldiers , poor people , and revolutionary masses under the control of Japan and the traitors .
The anti @-@ Japanese anti @-@ traitor national united front of the party and the Soviet Red Army must be expanded to all areas where the masses are found , and all the mass struggles must be raised from the low level to the high level , from the local to the national , and from the ordinary to the stage of resisting Japan and the traitors &apos; political regime by force .
Only when the struggles inside and outside the territory of the Soviet People &apos;s Republic are joined will Japanese imperialism and its running dogs the traitors be overcome .
It will be impossible to succeed in overcoming Japanese imperialism and its running dogs the traitors without recruiting the great majority of the worker class .
We must build firm strongholds in the major enterprises of key cities , organize broad mass organizations by utilizing all open and semi @-@ open possibilities , start from the concept of striving for victorious results ( even very small victories ) by assessing the concrete environment , activate , organize , and lead the worker masses in economic and political struggles , and give attention to the protection and education of cadres in the enterprises .
We must accumulate the great strengths of the worker masses in preparation for a decisive battle .
Striving for the leadership power of the worker class in China &apos;s revolution is the party &apos;s fundamental principle in the worker movement .
It will be Impossible to succeed in overcoming Japanese imperialism and its running dogs the traitors without the participation of the peasants , constituting 80 percent of China &apos;s population , in the struggle front .
The Communist Party and the soviet must satisfy the peasants &apos; demand for land and struggle for the thorough solution of the land issue and the elimination of the rural feudal oppression .
Only thus will we be able to mobilize millions of the peasant masses to take up arms and march to the battlefield against Japan and the traitors , to furnish an inexhaustible source of reinforcement to the national revolutionary war , and to turn the main objective of plunder by Japanese imperialism and China &apos;s national counterrevolution , the peasants , into China &apos;s national revolutionary army resisting such plunder .
In areas occupied by Japan and their vicinities , we must first confiscate the land and assets of spies and traitors and distribute them to the peasants .
Thereafter , in the struggle process , according to the people &apos;s own experiences , we will intensify the struggle and undertake the thorough solution of the land issue .
The party &apos;s fundamental principle is to link the land revolution and the national revolution .
Nor will it be possible to overcome Japanese Imperialism and the several million troops of China &apos;s traitors without the aid of the soldiers .
We must , on a broad mass foundation , undertake the work on the soldiers .
The party must appeal to the people of all soviet and White areas , Red Army soldiers , and guerrilla fighters to strive for the disintegration of the traitors &apos; troops .
When the tens and hundreds of millions of
people unwilling to become stateless slaves persuade the millions of officers and soldiers unwilling to become stateless slaves by sincere advices , by communicating with their relatives and friends , by letters of reproach , and by agitating slogans , it cannot help but influence them .
Our slogans are : Chinese will not fight Chinese !
Unite , workers , peasants , merchants , and students , and defend China by force ; unite the Red Army and the White army , and knock down Japanese imperialism and the traitors !
Travel expenses to those who wish to return home ; land to those who wish to farm ; those wishing to resist Japan join the Red Army and the volunteer army !
By its own example and sincere slogans , the Soviet People &apos;s Republic tells the oppressed Mongolians and Moslems : Organize your own state !
Japanese imperialism and the traitors are our common enemies .
Unite and knock down the enemies !
On the foundation of not overlooking any possibility for victory over Japanese imperialism and China &apos;s traitors , the foreign policy of the Soviet People &apos;s Republic is to negotiate with all nations , factions , and even individuals opposed to Japanese imperialism and its running dogs the traitors for the necessary understandings , compromises , diplomatic ties , and treaties of alliance .
The Soviet People &apos;s Republic and its government do not shoot off arrows without selection of target .
The Soviet People &apos;s Republic is willing to establish friendly relations with all those struggling in their own interest which is beneficial to the Soviet People &apos;s Republic &apos;s effort to resist Japan and punish the traitors
All policies and all effort are for victory over Japan and the traitors .
Anything against this goal will be rejected .
This is the strategic line of the Communist Party and the soviet .
V , Closed @-@ doorism , the Party &apos;s Major Danger
To overcome Japanese imperialism and its running dogs the traitors , the common enemies of the Chinese people , the Communist Party members must penetrate the masses , and participate in and lead all mass , national , and class struggles .
Here , the key is the application of an extensive united front .
Such a united front will , on the one hand , concentrate the maximum , strengths against the major enemies and on the other hand , enable the broad masses , according to their own political experiences , to understand the accuracy of the party &apos;s ideas and rally them under the party &apos;s banner .
The issue of the revolutionary leadership power must be more profoundly understood .
To gain the leadership power in China &apos;s revolution , the Communist Party cannot rely only on the party &apos;s propaganda and agitation ; it must make all the party members demonstrate leadership in their practical actions and daily struggles .
It is not enough for them to perform work among the lower level masses ( which is the main thing ) , but they must know how to conduct negotiations , discussions , compromises , and concessions with the upper level leaders of
other parties and factions who are connected with the lower level masses , in order to win those among them with , whom continued cooperation is possible , expose finally the wavering , deceitful , and renegate elements before the masses , and expel them by the strength of the masses .
For the party to gain leadership power , relying only on activities in the worker class ( which is important ) is not enough ; the Communist Party members must perform their activities in the rural villages and among the poor people , soldiers , petty bourgeois , intellectuals , and even the revolutionary alliess struggle for their intimate interests , and convince them that the Communist Party is the representative of the interests of the majority of the people of China as well as the worker class and that it represents the entire nation .
In all areas where the masses are found , regardless of how reactionary the leaders of such areas are , the Communist Party members must go there and perform revolutionary work .
Only when the Communist Party members demonstrate that they are the most energetic and vigorous vanguard of China &apos;s revolution which nothing can stop , and not &quot; holy disciples &quot; conducting abstract discussions of communist principles , will the Communist Party gain the leadership power of China &apos;s revolution .
To make a bolder application of the extensive united front for the party to gain leadership power , the party must wage a firm struggle against the &quot; leftwing &quot; closed @-@ doorism in the party .
Under the present situation , closed @-@ doorism is the party &apos;s major danger .
The sources of closed @-@ doorism are as follows : First is the lack of understanding of the current new political situation , which leads to the lack of understanding of the necessity to change the strategy to suit the new situation .
Second is the inability to link the party &apos;s basic slogans and fundamental policy outlines with the current action slogans and political action outlines in practical actions .
Third is the inability to flexibly apply Marxism , Leninism , and Stalinism to China &apos;s unique concrete environment , but turning them into rigid dogmas .
Such closed @-@ doorism tendency is manifested , in essence , in the fear of the enemies , the fear of the masses , and the lack of confidence in our own strengths , resulting in the fear to apply the strategy of an extensive united front .
Actually , it is identical with rightwing opportunism .
Its continuation will cause the party to become severed from the masses and relinquish its task of striving for the leadership power of China &apos;s revolution .
Therefore , the party must firmly oppose &quot; leftwing &quot; closed @-@ doorism , boldly apply the extensive united front , penetrate the millions of masses , have no fear of certain possible errors , and learn the technique of leading the masses in struggle .
Naturally , in the struggle against &quot; leftwing &quot; closed @-@ doorism , there must be no relaxation of the struggle against rightwing opportunism .
Rightwing opportunism suppresses the struggle of the masses for their intimate interests , sacrifices the demand of the peasants for land and that of the workers , poor people , and soldiers for better treatment for the interests of the national bourgeoisie and the rich peasants and the partial interests of its allies , is afraid to use the weapon of criticism against the allies , and has no courage to lead the masses and
force the allies to proceed to a higher stage of the revolution .
It may accept the influence of the national bourgeoisie , the upper level petty bourgeoisie , and the rural rich peasants and turn itself into their tail .
There is no doubt that it is possible for the Ch &apos;en Tu @-@ hsiu @-@ ism of 1927 to revive among some of the party units and party members in the new great revolution .
The party must wage a firm struggle against such rightwing opportunism .
Nevertheless , currently , &quot; leftwing &quot; closed @-@ door ism is the partyTs major danger .
The current opposition to the rightwing tendency is precisely for the purpose of successfully overcoming the &quot; leftwing &quot; tendency and thoroughly breaking down closed @-@ doorism , so that the strategy of an extensive united front is correctly and boldly applied in all tasks .
Then , the party will not be lagging behind the mass struggles , and the masses , beginning with the struggles for their daily intimate interests , will be elevated to the position of participating in the national revolutionary war to resist Japanese imperialism and its running dogs the traitors , the common enemies of the Chinese people .
Expansion and Consolidation of the Communist Party
To accomplish the sacred mission shouldered by the Chinese Communist Party in the great historical era , the party must be expanded and consolidated organizationally .
In the new great revolution , the Communist Party needs hundreds of thousands and millions of fighting members before it can lead China &apos;s revolution to thorough victory .
As the vanguard of China &apos;s proletariat , the Chinese Communist Party must absorb large numbers of workers and tenant peasants into the party and form a workers &apos; backbone in the party .
Meanwhile , as it is also the vanguard of the entire nation , all those willing to struggle for its principles , regardless of their background , may join the party .
All the courageous fighters in the national land revolution must be absorbed into the party to perform the party &apos;s work in all aspects .
Since China is an economically backward semi @-@ colony and colony , peasants and intellectuals of petty bourgeois background often constitute a majority in the party .
However , this does not lower in the slightest the Bolshevik position of the Chinese Communist Party .
As proven by the facts , a party of such components can complete the glorious mission bestowed by the Comintern , the vanguard of the world proletariat ; it can struggle arduously and persevere courageously .
Among the communist parties in all the nations in the world , except the party of the Soviet Union , the Chinese Communist Party occupies a glorious advanced position .
We must struggle against the closed @-@ doorism tendency in the party when developing the organization .
Whether an individual can struggle firmly for the principles proposed by the party is the major criterion of membership .
While attention must be given to the social composition , it is not the major criterion .
The party must act as a smelting furnace of communism and temper the many new members willing to struggle for its
principles into Bolshevik warriors with the highest class awareness .
The struggle between the two fronts in the party and communist education constitute one of the means to attain this goal .
The partyTs ideological unanimity in Bolshevism is the concrete manifestation of its firm leadership of the proletariat .
Closed @-@ doorism on the issue of organization , which , instead of starting from the positive fighting needs , starts from the concept of fear , must be thoroughly destroyed .
Innumerable active elements and mass leaders have emerged , or are emerging , in the great struggles of the national revolution and the land revolution .
The party organization , must , with warm welcome , open the door to them .
The party does not fear the infiltration of certain opportunists .
It assures the stability of its organization with the Bolshevik political line and iron discipline .
It does not fear the uneven political levels of the non @-@ proletarian party members ; it will elevate them to the position of vanguard by means of the communist education .
Large numbers of cadres must be trained .
The party needs thousands and tens of thousands of new cadres so that they can be sent group by group to all fronts .
It is not necessary to teach them every item of leadership skills before assigning work to them , but what is necessary is to enable them to learn in struggle .
We do not use the cadres and party members as we do machines .
Instead , we cherish and trust them9 assign them suitable work , and fully develop their talent and initiative .
We do not treat them with the bureaucraticist attitude .
Instead , by means of persuasive explanation of the tasks and concrete instructions of the work , we vividly and vigorously link them with the party &apos;s leading organs .
In regard to the errors of the cadres and party members in ideology or work , we do not discourage them lightly , call them opportunists , or even punish them .
Instead , we conduct patient and repeated persuasive education .
Errors in ideology and work are inevitable , but they can be corrected .
The spirit of studying in Leninism and the tempering of experience in struggle are precisely the excellent means to correct errors .
The firepower of struggle in the party must be directed toward those comrades who persist in their erroneous viewpoints and refuse to study , undergo tempering , or accept education .
Organizational conclusions of a certain extent are only necessary for those comrades who have committed serious errors and cannot be convinced by persuasion .
Nevertheless , all inner @-@ party struggles and organizational conclusions must still contain the essence of party education toward the party concerned .
Only when it comes to those opportunists who have consistently followed the wrong line , the party must not , because of their temporary expression of remorse , assign them important work .
In this great era of struggle , the rallying of party cadres firmly around the party &apos;s leading organs possesses a determining significance .
As the party must unite the entire party and lead the broadest masses to the war of national revolution and land revolution , it cannot succeed without many capable cadres serving as the links .
The correct organizational line and cadre policy constitute the premise of this task .
The Chinese Communist Party Central appeals to the entire party and cadres to struggle for the firm implementation of the party &apos;s strategies and lines , spread the united front to the entire nation , build the National Defense Government and the Resist @-@ Japan Allied Army , make the Soviet People &apos;s Republic the state of the entire people , make the Red Array the troops of the entire nation , make the party a great people &apos;s party , link the land revolution and the national revolution , and link the civil war with the national war .
Long live the sacred national warI
Long live China &apos;s independence , freedom , and unity !
Long live the Soviet New China !

ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE RESIST @-@ JAPAN VANGUARD ARMY OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE &apos;S BED ARMY
1 March 1936
&#91; Text &#93; The following is announced ; As Japanese imperialism pursues an outrageous course in North China without restraint , as Chiang Kai @-@ shek , Yen Hsi @-@ shan , and Sung Che @-@ yuan , with their servile attitude , follow their habit of fawning on foreigners , and as the destruction of the nation is imminent , the Military Affairs Commission of the People &apos;s Red Army of the Central Government of the Soviet People &apos;s Republic of China orders this array to march east and resist Japan .
This army wishes to ally with , all patriots and revolutionaries , without distinction of being new or old , factions , or backgrounds as long as they are sympathetic with the resistance of Japanese imperialism , in order to pursue together the great cause of the national revolution .
Wherever this army marches , it will protect the patriotic movements , the revolutionary people , the interests of the workers and peasants , the intellectuals , and the industry and commerce of the area .
It advocates the cessation of all civil wars and the alliance of the Red Army and the White army , in order to confront Japan unanimously .
It wishes to negotiate and reach agreements or understandings with all patriotic soldiers , whether they actively cooperate with this army to resist Japan or passively refrain from opposing this army and the patriotic people in their resistance of Japan .
China &apos;s greatest enemy is Japanese imperialism .
All the people of China must rise as one , unite , and defend the nation .
If the skin be lost , how can the .
fur be laid on ?
If the nation perishes , what good is one &apos;s life ?
Raise the just banner in the nation ; announce the punitive expedition in China !
Those with strength must donate their strength ; those with money must donate their money ; those with guns must donate their guns ; those with knowledge must contribute their knowledge .
Making 1 man equivalent to 10 is our spirit ; making 10 men equivalent to 1 is our strength .
The nation of China will not perish ; Japanese imperialism will fall .
The destiny of success or failure is self @-@ evident without need of argument .
Those who fail to understand the great principles , but fawn on the foreigners and trample on the people , or even resist this army , are severing themselves from the people of the nation , and this army will
punish them as spies and traitors .
Unite , workers , peasants , merchants , students and soldiers !
Down with Japanese imperialism !
Down with spies and traitors !
Long live the resist @-@ Japan national war !
Long live the new China of freedom and equality , and territorial integrity !
It is so announced .

DECLARATION AGAINST TRAITORS CHIANG KAI @-@ SHEK AND YEN HSI @-@ SHAN FOR BLOCKING THE EASTWARD MARCH OF THE RESIST @-@ JAPAN VANGUARD FORCE OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE &apos;S RED ARMY TO RESIST JAPAN AND FOR SABOTAGING THE RESIST @-@ JAPAN REAR
5 April 1936 &#91; Text &#93; Patriotic compatriots of the entire China !
Since the loss of the five North China provinces in fact though not in name , the Japanese imperialist bandits are speeding toward the annexation of all of China .
At this critical moment of the nation and the race , the Central Government of the Soviet People &apos;s Republic of China and the Revolutionary Military Commission of the Chinese Resist @-@ Japan Red Army have time and again demanded the cessation of all civil wars .
All must unite to resist Japan together , without distinction of Red Army or White army .
A national Resist @-@ Japan and Save @-@ the @-@ Nation Congress must be convened to organize a National Defense Government and a Resist @-@ Japan Allied Army .
The main force of the Red Army of the entire nation must concentrate in Hopeh to block the advance of Japanese imperialism .
In view of the urgent demand of the entire country to resist Japan and save the nation , the Central Government of the Soviet People &apos;s Republic and the Revolutionary Military Commission of the Chinese Resist @-@ Japan Red Army organized the Chinese People &apos;s Resist @-@ Japan Vanguard Army to cross the river and march east , resist Japan and punish the rebellious , and report to the anti @-@ Japanese compatriots of the entire nation that it fought in the vanguard and vented a righteous anger .
Yet , willing to serve as the running dog of Japanese imperialism , Shansi &apos;s Yen Hsi @-@ shan has mobilized his entire armed forces to block the path of the Red Army to resist Japan .
The outrageously wicked traitor head , Chiang Kai @-@ shek , is helping him with up to 10 divisions of men against the Resist @-@ Japan Vanguard Army of the Chinese People &apos;s Red Army , and has ordered the troops of Chang Hsueh @-@ liang and Yang Hu @-@ ch &apos;eng to push north and sabotage our resist @-@ Japan rear in the Shensi and Kansu soviet areas !
Look !
When Japanese imperialism swallowed five North China provinces and the Japanese army and Manchukuo troops marched into Peking , Tientsin , Chahar , and Suiyuan , Chiang Kai @-@ shek ordered his troops to withdraw completely from the five North China provinces .
Yet when the Red Army marched east to resist Japan and threatened its security in the five provinces , Chiang Kai @-@ shek transferred his troops to Shansi to attack the Resist @-@ Japan Vanguard Army of the Chinese People &apos;s Red Army .
Today , everyone knows Japanese imperialism &apos;s new scheme to annex North China : It is the concrete implementation of the so @-@ called Hirota &apos;s three great principles .
The joint &quot; anticommunist &quot; agreement of China , Japan , and &quot; Manchukuo &quot; is now being firmly carried out by traitor chief Chiang Kai @-@ shek .
The Central Government of the Soviet People &apos;s Republic of China and the Revolutionary Military Commission of the Resist @-@ Japan Red Army of China declare to all the patriotic compatriots in the entire China that Japanese imperialism plans to destroy China under the name of joint &quot; anti @-@ communism &quot; of China , Japan , and &quot; Manchukuo &quot; and mobilize all the traitor troops against the Resist @-@ Japan Vanguard Army of the Chinese People &apos;s Red Army .
For the freedom , independence , and territorial integrity of the nation of China , we are determined to exterminate with our full strength the traitor troops blocking the path of our Vanguard Army to resist Japan and sabotaging our rear so that we will smash Japanese imperialism &apos;s new scheme to destroy China and strive for an immediate direct encounter with Japan .
We also appeal to the patriotic compatriots of the entire nation to rise together , resist Japan and punish the rebellious , and support the eastern expedition of the Resist @-@ Japan Vanguard Army of the Chinese People &apos;s Red Army , in order to save the nation from perdition .
The victory of the Red Army in resisting Japan and punishing the rebellious is the victory of the patriotic compatriots of the entire nation ; it is the victory of the nation of China .
Stop all civil wars ; resist Japan together unanimously ; create a resist @-@ Japan people &apos;s front of all parties and all factions !
Oppose the &quot; joint anticommunism &quot; of China , Japan , and &quot; Manchukuo &quot; and the destruction of China !
Ally with Russia and the communists ; resist Japan together for China &apos;s independence and freedom !
Convene a National Resist @-@ Japan Save @-@ the @-@ Nation Congress ; organize a National Defense Government and a Resist @-@ Japan Allied Army !
Support the Red Army for immediate direct encounter with Japan !
Support the concentration of the main force of the Red Army of the entire nation in Hopeh against Japan !
Concentrate the army , navy , and air force of the entire nation in Hopeh against Japan !
Down with traitors Chiang Kai @-@ shek and Yen Hsi @-@ shan &quot; blocking the Red Army from resisting Japan and sabotaging its rear !
Arm the people of the entire China ; knock down Japanese imperialism ; knock down spies and traitors !
Long live the resist @-@ Japan national revolutionary war !

OPEN CABLE MESSAGE FOR ARMISTICE AND NEGOTIATIONS FOR ESTABLISHING ALLIANCE AGAINST JAPANESE AGGRESSION
5 May 1936 &apos;
&#91; Text &#93; The Military Commission of the Nanking National Government , the entire army , navy , and air force , all parties , factions , organizations , and newspaper publishers of the entire nation , and all compatriots unwilling to become stateless slaves :
Ever since the Soviet Central Government and the Revolutionary Military Commission of the Chinese Red Army organized the Resist @-@ Japan Vanguard Army of the Chinese People &apos;s Red Army to cross the river and march east , the Vanguard Army was victorious wherever it went , and the entire nation responded .
Nevertheless , just when it occupied the TTung @-@ pTu railway and actively prepared to march east to Hopeh and make direct contact with Japan , Chiang Kai @-@ shek sent over 10 divisions to Shansi , cooperated with Yen Hsi @-@ shan to block its path to resist Japan , and ordered Chang Hsueh @-@ liang and Yang Hu @-@ ch &apos;eng and the troops of northern Shensi to march on the Red area in Shensi and Kansu and sabotage our resist @-@ Japan rear .
The Resist @-@ Japan Vanguard Army of the Chinese People &apos;s Red Army actually should concentrate its entire strength to wipe out Chiang &apos;s troops blocking its path , in order to attain the goal of direct contact with Japan .
Nevertheless , after repeated consideration , the Soviet Central Government and the Red Army Revolutionary Military Commission feel that , in face of the national calamity , when we engage in battle , regardless of which side wins , it will be a loss to China &apos;s national defense strength and only please Japanese imperialism .
Furthermore , among the troops of Chiang Kai @-@ shek and Yen Hsi @-@ shan , there are many patriotic soldiers who wish to stop the civil war and resist Japan together .
Though obeying the orders to block the path of the Red Army , they actually find it an act against their conscience .
In view thereof , for the purpose of preserving the national defense strengths in order to carry out the war to resist Japan , for the purpose of firmly performing our proposal to the people of the nation to stop the
civil war and resist Japan together , and for the purpose of hastening the final awareness of Chiang Kai @-@ shek and the patriotic troops under him , though many victories were gained in Shansi , the Worker @-@ Peasant Democratic Government and the Red Army Revolutionary Military Commission , are withdrawing the People &apos;s Resist @-@ Japan Vanguard Army to the west bank , of the Yellow River .
By this act , they express their sincerity to the Nanking government , the army , navy , and air force , and the people of the entire nation .
We hope , within 1 month , to cease all hostilities and negotiate for peace with all the armed units attacking the resist @-@ Japan Red Army in order to attain our goal of resisting Japan together .
The Soviet Central Government and the Red Army Revolutionary Military Commission hereby solemnly advise the gentlemen in the Nanking government : At the critical moment of losing the nation and the race , you should , according to reason , immediately repent and , with the spirit of &quot; brothers quarreling within the walls will defend themselves against the outsiders together , &quot; stop the civil war on a national scale , first of all in Shensi , Kansu , and Shansi .
Both sides must send delegates to discuss the concrete measures to resist Japan and save the nation .
This will benefit not only you gentlemen , but also the nation and the state .
If you persist in your erroneous ways and continue to serve as spies and traitors , your control will finally collapse , and you will be deserted and overthrown by the people of the entire nation .
The proverb says : &quot; When a thousand men point their fingers , you die without illness . &quot; It also says : &quot; Lay down the butcher knife and immediately become a Buddha . &quot; We hope you will give the matter your serious consideration .
The Soviet Central Government and the Red Army Revolutionary Military Commission appeal to all the organizations , parties and factions , and people of the entire nation who are unwilling to become stateless slaves to support our proposal to cease hostilities and negotiate for peace and resist Japan together , organize an association to promote the cessation of the civil war , and send delegates to block the firing line between the two sides and to further and supervise the complete performance of our proposal .

DECLARATION OF THE SOVIET CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TO THE MOSLEM PEOPLE 25 May 1936 &#91; Text &#93; Dear Moslem brothers :
The second imperialist world war to redivide the colonies will soon break out .
The people and land of China &apos;s five races are cut away in large sections by Japanese imperialism , which is now advancing toward Suiyuan , Ninghsia , Kansu , and Sinkiang .
The calamity of the destruction of your roots and extermination of your race is imminent .
Will you resign to destruction and division by others , or will you rise and fight and strive for the independence and freedom of the Moslems ?
The glory of the recovery of the Turkish Moslems will serve as the compass to all the Moslems and all the oppressed nations .
At this critical moment , we hope you will rise up immediately !
The Moslems suffered the oppression and exploitation of China &apos;s ruling class in the past decade or more , especially the harsh levies and vexatious taxes of Chiang Kai @-@ shekrs Nanking government , which made the life of the Moslems unbearable .
The Nanking government also frequently provoked ill feelings between the Moslems and the Chinese , to the extent of mutual slaughtering .
It would then send troops to suppress them , causing the Moslem and Chinese people to lose all their energy , in order to benefit its cruel and greedy regime .
In the past several years , the Kuomintang warlords headed by traitor Chiang Kai @-@ shek recklessly capitulated to Japanese imperialism and attempted to sell all the interests of the Chinese people .
With the fall of the four northeast provinces , the loss of the five North China provinces in fact if not in name , and the activity of the autonomy movement of southern Fukien , the Nanking government has now designated the four northwest provinces as an &quot; anticommunist &quot; zone .
The entry of the Nanking troops into Kansu is the major step to destroy the northwest and suppress the independence movement of the Moslems , Mongolians , and Tibetans .
The Chinese People &apos;s Soviet Government and the People &apos;s Red Army Resist @-@ Japan Vanguard Army have always considered the resistance of imperialism ,
especially Japanese imperialism , and the thorough liberation of the Chinese nation and other small and weak nations their fundamental tasks .
As the eastward march of the Vanguard Army against Japan is blocked by traitor Chiang Kai @-@ shek , they feel that consolidating the rear defense , developing the resist @-@ Japan base , and rallying all people and nations unwilling to become stateless slaves , primarily the minorities of the Northwest , in order to prepare for direct confrontation with Japan , are more important .
Therefore , the westward march of the resist @-@ Japan People &apos;s Red Army is not only a necessary step in the practical preparation against Japan , but also an excellent opportunity for the independence and liberation of the Mongolians , Moslems , and other small and weak minorities , especially the Moslems .
Therefore , we solemnly declare to the Moslem people :
According to the principle of national self @-@ determination , we advocate that the affairs of the Moslems must be completely handled by the Moslems themselves , that , in all Moslem areas , the Moslems must establish their independent and autonomous political power and handle all the political , economic , religious , custom , ethical , educational , and other matters , and that , in all areas where the Moslems constitute a minority , under the principle of national equality , the Moslems , with the district , township , and village as the units , must manage their own affairs and establish their own government .
According to the principle of the freedom of religion , we will protect Mohammedanism and the Ahongs and guarantee the absolute freedom of belief of the Moslems .
Armament is an indispensable condition of an independent and autonomous nation .
We wish to rally all armed strengths of the Moslems and to help and develop them .
We wish to arm the Moslems and form an independent &quot; Moslem Resist @-@ Japan Army . &quot; We hope that the Moslem armed forces will become one of the major strengths in the Resist @-@ Japan Allied Army .
Abolish all the harsh levies and vexatious taxes imposed by the warlords , bureaucrats , and militia ; improve the life of the Moslems .
Protect the Moslem language ; develop the culture and education of the Moslems ; start Moslem newspapers ; raise the Moslem political and cultural levels .
The Moslems and Chinese must unite closely to knock down Japanese imperialism and the spies and traitors .
Form an alliance with Turkey , Outer Mongolia , the Soviet Union , and
other nations and states sympathetic with China &apos;s endeavor for the
thorough liberation of all races and resist Japan together .
Dear Moslem brothers !
Now is the time when the small and weak nations rise up and struggle for survival and strive for thorough liberation .
You are situated between the already liberated Soviet Union , Outer Mongolia , and Turkey and the Chinese Soviet Red Army in the process of liberation .
As long as you will become aware and rise up and struggle , victory will be yours .
It is solemnly declared .

DECLARATION ON THE NORTHERN MARCH OF ARMED FORCES FROM KWANGTUNG AND KWANGSI TO COMBAT JAPANESE AGGRESSION
11 June 1936
&#91; Text &#93; Recently , Japanese imperialism &apos;s large troop reinforcement in Hopeh and Chahar for the direct occupation of North China , its organizing of nationwide smuggling to destroy China &apos;s customs system and national economy , and its launching of the autonomy movement in Fukien all prove that it is carrying out its plan to destroy all of China at an unprecedented speed .
Not only failing to show the slightest resistance , but Chiang Kai @-@ shekTs Nanking government assists Japanese imperialism in its aggression everywhere , suppresses all the resist @-@ Japan national salvation movements of the Chinese people , blocks the eastward march of the Resist @-@ Japan Vanguard Army of the Chinese People &apos;s Red Army , signs the &quot; Sino @-@ Japanese Anti @-@ Communist Agreement , &quot; leads the wolf into the house , rejects the dissident in order to create an individual dictatorship , and enables Japanese imperialism to do as it pleases .
At this time when the Japanese bandits and the shameless traitors are creating havoc in China , all the patriotic soldiers and compatriots with conscience and enthusiasm are filled with righteous anger , and they swear to struggle to the bitter end for the survival of the nation of China !
When Kwangtung and Kwangsi raise high the righteous banner to resist Japan and send their troops north , and demand that the Nanking government immediately send troops to resist Japan together , wherever their righteous voice is heard , the people of the nation become stimulated .
On behalf of the resist @-@ Japan people and resist @-@ Japan Red Army , we wish to express our respect and support to the patriotic soldiers and compatriots of Kwangtung and Kwangsi and declare our desire to form a resist @-@ Japan alliance to their authorities and struggle together .
We appeal to the patriotic soldiers in the entire nation to rise up and respond to the patriotic compatriots of the nation , expand the resist @-@ Japan and national salvation movement , and coordinate with the uprising of Kwangtung and Kwangsi .
The current military action against Japan must be expanded to a sacred national revolutionary war of armed resistance of Japan by the people of the entire country .
Meanwhile , we demand that the Nanking government immediately
repent , accede to the demands of Kwangtung and Kwangsi , and mobilize the army , navy9 and air force of the whole China to march north and resist Japan .
The Chinese People &apos;s Red Army is willing to concentrate in Hopeh , serve as the vanguard to resist Japan , and begin direct confrontation with Japanese imperialism .
Nevertheless , since Kwangtung and Kwangsi expressed their intentions , Chiang Kai @-@ shekrs Nanking government not only has not indicated any sincerity to accede to their demands , but has delayed time and again , and openly accused the authorities of Kwangtung and Kwangsi for provoking a civil war and destroying unity , while surreptitiously transferring large troops to block the troops of Kwangtung and Kwangsi from marching North and resisting Japan , provoking and alienating , and activating a civil war , in order to sabotage the resist @-@ Japan front .
In regard to such criminal acts of Chiang Kai @-@ shek , the people of the entire nation absolutely refuse to become stateless slaves .
The patriotic soldiers must immediately sever themselves from Chiang Kai @-@ shek1s policy to capitulate to Japan and march North to resist Japan together with the troops of Kwangtung and Kwangsi and the Red Army !
The matter is urgent !
Patriotic soldiers and Compatriots of the entire nation must closely unite , concentrate their forces against Japanese imperialism , and attack together !
More than ever before , the Chinese people urgently demand a firm resist @-@ Japan united front .
We must firmly oppose the Second Kuomintang Central General Meeting called by Chiang Kai @-@ shek and his National Congress .
We advocate the immediate holding of a national resist @-@ Japan congress .
We ask all the resist @-@ Japan and antitraitor political , social , and occupational organizations and armed units in the nation to elect their own delegates to the congress and immediately realize the following outlines :
( 1 ) Announce the severance of relations with and declare war on Japan ; punish Manchukuo ; recover the lost territory in the Northeast and North China .
( 2 ) Abolish all unequal treaties between China and Japan and cancel all traitorous loans .
( 3 ) Punish the spies and traitors who gave up power and territory and brought calamity to the nation and the people .
( 4 ) Mobilize the army , navy , and air force of the entire China for direct contact with Japan .
( 5 ) Confiscate all the assets of Japanese imperialism and the spies and traitors for use as resist @-@ Japan expenses .
( 6 ) Guarantee the freedoms of speech , , publication , meeting , and forming associations to resist Japan and save the nation ; release all political prisoners .
( 7 ) Organize a national defense government and a resist @-@ Japan allied army .
( 8 ) Ally with all states and nations in the world treating us with equality ; ally with all oppressed people in Japan .
These are the outlines to resist Japan and save the nation demanded by the people of the entire China , and they should be the outlines of Kwangtung and Kwangsi in sending troops to resist Japan .
We sincerely hope that the patriotic leaders of the two provinces will courageously activate and support the people &apos;s patriotic movement to resist Japan , extensively arm and organize the resist @-@ Japan people , cooperate with the people of the entire nation , and struggle for the thorough realization of these outlines .
We believe that only when the resist @-@ Japan armed forces and the resist @-@ Japan people become one , and only when the resist @-@ Japan armed forces become the armed forces of the resist @-@ Japan people , will the great cause of liberating the nation of China initiated by Kwangtung and Kwangsi attain its final victory .
Support Kwangtung and Kwangsi in sending troops to march North against Japan !
All patriotic soldiers of China unite with Kwangtung and Kwangsi and hit Japan together !
Oppose Chiang Kai @-@ shekrs blocking of the righteous troops of Kwangtung and Kwangsi from marching North against Japan !
Call a national resist @-@ Japan and save @-@ the @-@ nation congress !
Oppose Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s Second Kuomintang Central General Meeting and his National Congress !
Oppose Japanese imperialism &apos;s smuggling ; confiscate all contrabands !
Down with Japanese imperialism !
Long live the resist @-@ Japan united front of the people of the entire China !

DECLARATION OF THE CENTKAL GOVERNMENT OF THE SOVIET TO THE SOCIETY OF BROTHERS
15 July 1936 &apos; , : , :
&#91; Text &#93; Gentlemen of the Society of Brothers :
Recently , the barbarous bandit conduct of Japanese imperialism , the sworn enemy of the nation of China , to annex China is becoming ever more fierce .
Not only taking our four northeast provinces by force , but they are actually controlling all of North China .
Not only utilizing smuggling to destroy China1s entire economic life and aggravate the miseries of bankruptcy and unemployment , but they have resorted to their colonial system in Taiwan and Korea and sent 50,000 reinforcements to North China .
All such political and economic measures are for the purpose of turning North China into a second &quot; Manchukuo &quot; and the base to attack the whole China .
Japanese imperialism is in the process of carrying out unlawful aggression in China &apos;s northwest and Central and South China , wishing to turn the entire country into its colony and the 400 million people into its slaves and beasts of burden .
The calamity of losing the nation and the race is imminent .
Thirty thousand catties hanging by a single hair , we are at the critical moment between life and death , between survival and perdition .
Except the minority of traitors and spies , all the Chinese with any righteous feeling and all those unwilling to become stateless slaves are filled with a powerful anger and wish to wage a death struggle against Japanese imperialism !
Recently , southwest military leaders Li Tsung @-@ jen and ChTen Chi @-@ t &apos;ang raised high the resist @-@ Japan big banner , marched north , and demanded that Chiang Kai @-@ shek of the Nanking government send troops to resist Japan .
The resist @-@ Japan national revolutionary war has entered a new stage .
The Society of Brothers has always followed the principle of promoting the Chinese to eliminate the Manchurians , and hitting the rich to relieve the poor .
It actively participated in the anti @-@ Manchurian revolutionary movement of 1911 , and the north Shensi revolution also received much support and participation of the Society of Brothers comrades .
Comrades such as Hsieh Tzu @-@ ch &apos;ang and Liu Chih @-@ tan were not only leaders in the Red Army ,
but also models in the Society of Brothers .
Such revolutionary spirit and glorious achievements must be brought to a greater light today , and the society must struggle for the salvation of themselves as well as China .
The Chinese Soviet People &apos;s Central Government has made declarations time and again , announcing its principle of national salvation and appealing to all those unwilling to become stateless slaves to unite together , without distinction of parties or factions or classes , and together fight our common enemiesJapanese imperialism and the spies and traitors , in order to gain the independence and liberation of the nation of China .
The Society of Brothers has always been an organization representing national patriots and the broad peasant and laboring masses .
Oppressed by the government , the warlords , and the bureaucrats , branded as &quot; low @-@ class people , &quot; and slandered as &quot; bandits , &quot; the society cannot exist in the open .
The abuse suffered by the society from the hands of the ruling class is more or less identical with what we have suffered !
As you advocated promoting the Chinese to eliminate the Manchurians in the past , we now advocate resisting Japan , to save the nation ; as you advocate hitting the rich to relieve the poor , we advocate hitting the local tyrants and divide the land ; as you care not for money but for justice and associate with the heroes and tough guys in the world , we sacrifice ourselves to save China and the world and rally the oppressed and exploited nations and classes and strata in the whole world .
Our viewpoints and principles are not much different ; our enemies and our future are completely identical .
Therefore , with great sincerity , we declare to all our brothers of the Society of Brothers of the whole country : Regardless of what misunderstandings and dissatisfactions between us in the past , we must now forget and discard them .
We must unite under our common desire to resist Japan and save the nation , form a close and brotherly unity , and together save the nation from calamity with righteousness in our hearts .
This is your sacred obligation and that of the people of the entire China !
The Soviet Government is the government of the oppressed people of China .
We undertake the responsibility of receiving and protecting all those abused and persecuted by the Kuomintang government .
Therefore , the Society of Brothers may exist openly under the Soviet Government .
We have established a Society of Brothers reception office to receive the heroic , courageous , noble , and righteous people .
It is our hope , and we request and welcome the members of the society in all areas , either in person or by delegates , to come to us and discuss the plans to save the nation .
We eagerly await and welcome you .
We shout :
Bring forth the revolutionary spirit of the Society of Brothers of the past !
Unite , the Society of Brothers and the people throughout China , to hit Japan and promote China !
Long live the liberation of the nation of China !

DIRECTIVE ON THE LAND POLICY 22 July 1936
&#91; Text &#93; To make the soviet truly the center of unity of the people of the entire nation , all its current policies must embody a clear popular essence and a profound national quality .
The land policy has always occupied the major position among all its policies .
By carrying out the land revolution , it will not only relieve the peasants , constituting 80 percent of the national population , of feudal exploitation , but also encourage them to participate actively in the national liberation cause and reinforce the national revolutionary strength .
Since the Central Politburo conference in December last year , the soviet has made many important changes in the land policy ( such as the rich peasant and small landowner policies , the decisions on class analysis and certain special problems , etc . ) .
Such changes have gained the support of the broad people and produced practical results in the soviet area .
Nevertheless , to attain the goal of liquidating the feudal remnants and building , within all possibilities , a broad people &apos;s resistJapan united front by means of the enforcement of the land policy , we must further scrutinize it and make the necessary changes .
Therefore , the Central has made the following decisions on this issue :
( 1 ) All the land and assets of spies and traitors will be confiscated in their entirety .
( 2 ) The land , grain , buildings , and assets of the landlord class will be confiscated .
After confiscation , the landlords will be given land for farming and the necessary production tools and material .
The quantity and quality of the land will be determined by the majority opinion of the local peasant masses .
( 3 ) The land of the following categories of small property owners will not be confiscated :
( a ) Free lances , technical personnel , teachers , medical students , small merchants , and handicraftsmen .
( b ) Workers who saved the money for the land by their own labor .
( c ) Small landlords whose living conditions are very inferior .
( d ) Those who were originally not landlords but were forced to rent their land out due to the loss of labor force .
( e ) Those who worked as hired help even though they rented out their own land .
( 4 ) The land belonging to resist @-@ Japan soliders and those dedicated to the resist @-@ Japan cause will not be confiscated ,
( 5 ) The land and the surplus production tools ( farm tools ; domestic animals ) of the rich peasants will not be confiscated .
Where the division of all land is carried out upon the demand of the basic peasants , the land of the rich peasant landlords must also be included in the division , but the rich peasants must receive their shares according to the general rules of division ( receiving the same shares as the peasants in general ) .
( 6 ) In regard to the land belonging to large farmowners and enterprisers ( enterprise owners who do not rely mainly on land rent exploitation , but on hiring large numbers of help to farm their land or raise livestock ) , as their production pattern is rather progressive , they will be handled according to the rich peasant policy .
Where the majority of the peasants demand division , the land , animals , and grain of the large farmowners and enterprisers must be surrendered for division .
( 7 ) In case of merchants who are also large landlords , their land is handled similar to the landlords in general , but the commerce part of their assets must not be infringed upon .
( 8 ) High interest loans are cancelled .
The Soviet People &apos;s Government will promulgate a new loan regulation and restrict the interest rates in the soviet area .
Nevertheless , commercial loans and loans between the laboring people are not included among those cancelled .
( 9 ) The leasing of land is permitted in the soviet area .
Howevers regardless of the type of owner renting out land , the cruel and slavish leasing of the old days must be abolished .
The leasing regulations promulgated by the Soviet Government must be observed without exception .
( 10 ) The living conditions of rural workers must be improved .
The Soviet Government will formulate special regulations on rural hired help for promulgation and enforcement .
The foregoing decisions become effective Immediately in the newly created soviet areas .
In the old soviet areas where the land has been divided , the original method will be followed and there will be no change .
The Soviet Central Government will formulate and promulgate the concrete and detailed regulations for implementation of the foregoing decisions separately .
Central , 22 July 1936
&quot; Selections of Current Event Discussions , &quot; Chih @-@ hsin Printing Press , 1 May 1937
&#91; Text &#93; Gentlemen of the Central Committee and the entire membership of the Chinese Kuomintang :
It has been a year since this party , the Soviet Government , and the Red Army published the declaration to resist Japan .
Though our proposal to organize a national united front and rally all parties , factions , and fields to resist Japan together has won the support of the patriotic leaders and people of the entire country , as your party and your party government hesitate over its acceptance , the sacred national self @-@ defense war , up till now , has not been launched .
Meanwhile , the Japanese bandits take advantage of the gap and march straight in , taking a foot after gaining an inch .
The tragic calamity of perdition is imminent .
The entire nation is in a panic , unable to live through the day .
Such grave danger of the nation and the people has been entirely caused by the erroneous policy of your party and your party government .
Now is the critical moment of the nation and the race .
This party cannot but again shout to you in desperation : Immediately stop the civil war ; organize a national resist @-@ Japan united front ; launch the sacred national self @-@ defense war ; resist the aggression of Japanese imperialism ; defend and recover China &apos;s territorial sovereignty ; save the people of the entire nation from deep water and searing fire .
If you continue the internal squabbles and refuse to shift the muzzle of the gun toward the outside , change the policy of concession to resistance , turn the situation of split to unity , and alter the condition of dispersal to unanimity , then the calamity and damage will be unimaginable , while your infamy will remain irrevocably through the generations .
With an attitude of sincerity , we are writing to you gentlemen and the Chinese Kuomintang membership .
After reading the declaration of your party &apos;s Second Central General Meeting and the report of Committee Chairman Chiang at the meeting , we find that your Second Central General Meeting has not made an affirmative answer to the issue of averting perdition and seeking survivalan issue which has been worrying the people of the entire nation day and
night , and that it has not made a complete revision of the foreign policy of your party &apos;s Fifth General Congress &quot; before it is completely hopeless , peace must not be abandoned ; before the final moment arrives , sacrifice must not be discussed lightly . &quot; It cannot but greatly disappoint the patriotic people of the entire nation .
In his report , Committee Chairman Chiang made a new explanation of the policy of your party &apos;s Fifth General Congress .
He stated : &quot; The CentralTs minimum limit in diplomacy is to preserve the integrity of territorial sovereignty .
We absolutely will not tolerate the infringement of our territorial sovereignty by any nation ; we absolutely will not sign any agreement encroaching upon our territorial sovereignty ; we absolutely will not tolerate any instance in violation of our territorial sovereignty , To put it more clearly , should anyone wish to force us to sign anything damaging to our territorial sovereignty , such as the recognition of the puppet regime , that would be the time when we could no longer tolerate the situation , the time of our final sacrifice . &quot; Committee Chairman Chiang &apos;s explanation was extremely necessary , because the Chinese people never could figure out what constituted the minimum limit when &quot; peace is completely hopeless &quot; or when would be &quot; the final moment of sacrifice . &quot; We admit that Committee Chairman Chiangfs explanation shows certain improvement over the past , and we sincerely welcome such improvement .
Nevertheless , basically it still cannot satisfy the demand of the people of the nation , because in his report , he also felt that &quot; the diplomatic situation in the past 6 months has not reached the stage when peace is hopeless .
Rather than being hopeless , one might say that there has been a ray of hope in the past 6 months compared with before .
I daresay that the most recent diplomatic outlook has not reached the final moment . &quot; Therefore , he still hesitates to bring up the task of organizing a resist @-@ Japan united front , and he still refuses to immediately launch a sacred national resistJapan war .
With AbyssiniaTs failure as an excuse , he continues the policy of concession .
This is extremely regrettable .
It is far too inadequate to satisfy the demand of the people of the nation .
In view of the people of the entire nation , the fall of the four north @-@ east provinces , the loss of the greater part of Chahar , the rampage of the East Hopeh Anti @-@ Communist Autonomous Government , the puppetry of the Hopeh @-@ Chahar Political Committee , the stationing of large numbers of Japanese troops in Hopeh and Chahar , the destruction of the economic power of North China , the open smuggling inundating the whole country . , the desperate situation of national industry and commerce , the approaching bankruptcy of the state finance , the demolition of the customs authority , the general installation of Japanese special service organs in North China , and even the northwest provinces , the large scale attack on Sui yuan by Japanese and puppet Mongolian troops , the formation of the Inner Mongolian government , the unrestrained flight of enemy planes in China &apos;s territorial sky , the reckless conduct of Japanese tramps , the direct and indirect intervention in the students &apos; patriotic movements and the people &apos;s patriotic expressions by the Japanese bandits , the massacre of large numbers of workerpeasant masses , the intolerable insults suffered
by many patriotic people , soldiers , police , and reporters , and even by many of the important members and government officials of your party , the forced withdrawal of troops defending the land , the alert of Tsingtao , the instigation of the South China autonomy movement , etc .
were all tremendous losses to ChinaTs territorial sovereignty .
In the view of the people of the entire nation , the Sung @-@ hu &#91; Shanghai &#93; , TTang @-@ ku , Ho &#91; 0149 &#93; -Mei &#91; 2734 &#93; , and North China anti @-@ communist agreements , and other unpublished written and unwritten pacts were all treaties involving the loss of sovereignty and territory .
Therefore , in the view of the people of the entire nation , peace has long been hopeless and the final moment of sacrifice has long arrived .
Short of launching the people and the armed forces of the entire nation to wage a resolute self @-@ defense war , the total loss of China &apos;s territorial sovereignty cannot be averted .
Except by launching the strengths of the entire China to hit back firmly , the bandit plan of Japanese imperialism to destroy China definitely will not change .
The changes in the pattern of aggression , the shifts in its direction , and the expression of the so @-@ called &quot; economic aid &quot; are not for the purpose of ceasing aggression , but precisely for the purpose of facilitating it .
Thus , should one feel that , after marching into Hopeh and Chahar , the Japanese bandits would concentrate on the economic aggression of the five North China provinces and therefore , there would be hope of peace , one would only be deceiving oneself as well as others .
Should one think that the Japanese bandits would stop its aggression north of the Yellow River while we could enjoy partial peace south of the river , it would also be an illusion , .
Look !
When you gentlemen are loudly proclaiming that peace is not yet hopeless , the Japanese and puppet troops of northern Chahar are advancing on a large scale against Suiyuan .
After establishing special service organs in Suiyuan , Ninghsia , Inner Mongolia ^ and Kansu , Japanese imperialism built main and auxiliary airfields in such areas .
It arbitrarily set up a consulate in Szechwan which led to the massacre of our patriotic compatriots .
After reinforcing the troops in North China , the ferocious and savage Japanese army is poised for action , and minor confrontations occur frequently along the defense line of the 29th Army .
The situation of North China is becoming ever more dangerous .
Such espionage groups as the military investigation and economic investigation committees of the Japanese bandits travel arrogantly everywhere without restraint , entering every crack .
Their espionage network spreads throughout the country , even within various organizations of your party and your party government .
All these indicate that the situation is extremely critical .
That peace is absolutely impossible and the resistance war absolutely inevitable is unequivocal .
Your views are entirely wrong .
In the declaration of your party &apos;s Second Central General Meeting , you stated solemnly : &quot; The prerequisite to defense against aggression is to concentrate all national salvation strengths under the direction of the Central Government , unifying the pace and consolidating the battle line .
Therefore , the necessity of unity and discipline is an unshakable ironclad principle .
Meanwhile , the unity of the army and government and
military command is especially the minimum requirement of a modern nation . &quot; We fully agree that launching the maximum strength of resistance of the people of the entire country and concentrating and unifying the national salvation forces of the whole nation for the thorough victory of the resistance war are absolutely necessary * As early as the &quot; 18 September &quot; incident3 this party and the Soviet Government and the Red Army appealed to the people and troops of the entire country to wage a sacred national revolutionary war and expel Japanese imperialism from China .
After the &quot; 28 January &quot; Shanghai war , this party and the Soviet Government and the Red Army proposed to the armed units of your party and your party government encircling and attacking the soviet area to stop the war , discuss peace , and resist Japan together .
After the North China incident , we again proposed the policy of organizing promptly the most extensive resist @-@ Japan united front to include all parties , all factions , and all fields in China .
Innumerable times , we requested your party and your party government to stop- all civil wars and resist Japan unanimously , and we suggested calling a resist @-@ Japan national salvation congress elected by all the people and all the armed units willing to resist Japan , in order to formulate a plan to resist Japan and save the nation and to elect a unified nationwide national defense government and organize a resist @-@ Japan coalition army for a large @-@ scale resist @-@ Japan war .
We firmly declared that the Soviet Government was willing to become a component of such a national defense government and the Red Army was willing to serve under the general headquarters of the resist @-@ Japan coalition army , to be in charge of certain designated front , and to guarantee the completion of all combat missions .
All the proposals of this party and the Soviet Government and the Red Army are completely compatible with the demands of the people of the entire country and constitute the only correct policy to avert perdition and seek survival .
The people of the entire nation have never been so urgent in their demand for the cessation of the civil war and for concentration and unity , in order to resist Japan together .
Only the Japanese bandits and their agents will incite continued splits .and continued civil wars , because only by so doing will the condition for the destruction of China be created for the Japanese bandits .
Nevertheless , the &quot; concentration and unity &quot; advocated by your party &apos;s Second Central General Meeting is actually putting the cart before the horse .
You must know that the civil war and disunity of the past decade have been entirely a result of the erroneous policy of relying on imperialism followed by your party and your party government , especially the consistent nonresistance policy since the &quot; 18 September &quot; incident .
Under your slogan of &quot; pacifying the internal before driving out the external , &quot; you have been waging the civil war continuously from year to year , launched innumerable encirclements of the Red Army , and suppressed with all your might the patriotic and democratic movements of the people of the entire country .
Up till very recently , you have relinquished the northeast and North China and forgotten that Japanese imperialism is China &apos;s biggest enemy , while devoting all your strengths against the soviet and the Red Army , pursuing the internal squabbles within your own
camp , blocking the path of the Red Army against Japan , sabotaging the resist @-@ Japan rear of the Red Army , ignoring the demand of the people of the entire nation to resist Japan , and depriving the people of their freedom and rights .
Patriotism is a crime , and jails for the wronged are scattered all over the country ; betrayal deserves reward , and the spies and traitors celebrate together in their official robes .
To seek concentration and unity with such erroneous policies is truly looking for fish on a tree , and the result will be exactly the opposite .
We now tell you gentlemen seriously : If you do not fundamentally change your erroneous policies , if you do not turn your hostility toward Japanese imperialism , but continue to aim at your own compatriots , then , even if you wish to barely maintain the status quo , it will be impossible .
Concentration and unity and the so @-@ called &quot; modern nation &quot; are mere empty words .
What the people want are the concentration and unity to resist Japan and save the nation , not the concentration and unity to flatter the foreigners and trample on the people .
What they eagerly demand is a government truly devoted to the salvation of the nation and the people , a truly democratic republic .
They demand a democratic republican government protecting their interests .
The major outlines of such a government must be : First , it can resist external aggression ; second , it can give the people their democratic rights ; third , it can develop the national economy and reduce , or even eliminate , the misery of the people .
When it comes to a &quot; modern nation , &quot; these are the only outlines required by the colonial and semi @-@ colonial China in modern times .
The people of the entire nation , with an eager desire and a firm determination , are in the process of struggling for the realization of this goal , yet the policy of your party and your party government is completely opposite to the desire of the people .
To thus seek the people &apos;s confidence is absolutely impossible .
The Chinese Communist Party , the Chinese Soviet Government , and the Chinese Red Army now solemnly state : We support a united democratic republic of the whole nation , a congress elected by general popular vote , a resist @-@ Japan national salvation delegates &apos; mass meeting of the people and the resist @-@ Japan troops of the entire nation , and a united national defense government .
We declare : Upon the formation of a national united democratic republic , the soviet area will become a part thereof , the delegates of the soviet area will participate in the national congress , and the same democratic system will be carried out in the soviet area .
We feel that the national defense conference decided upon by your party &apos;s Second Central General Meeting and the people &apos;s congress now being called by your party and your party government cannot fulfill the task of concentration and unity to resist Japan and save the nation .
According to the national defense conference regulations passed by your party &apos;s Second Central General Meeting , the organization of the conference is limited to a minority of your party and your party government and its duty is merely to serve as an advisory organ to your party and your party government .
That such a conference will not be able to accomplish anything or gain
the confidence of the people is extremely clear .
Meanwhile , according to the &quot; Draft of the Constitution of the Republic of China &quot; and the &quot; Organization Law and Delegates &apos; Election Law of the People &apos;s Congress &quot; passed by your party government , the people &apos;s congress which you gentlemen wish to convene likewise will not be able to accomplish anything or gain the people &apos;s confidence , because such a people &apos;s congress is merely an organ manipulated by your party and a few officials of your party government ; it will be an accessory and an ornament of the few officials .
Such national defense conference and people &apos;s congress possess not the slightest resemblance to the national resist @-@ Japan national salvation congress ( national defense conference ) and the democratic republic of China and its congress advocated by this party .
We feel that a resist @-@ Japan national defense conference must include the delegates of all parties , all factions , all fields , and all armed units and become a power organ truly able to decide on plans to resist Japan and save &apos; the nation .
A united national defense government will be created from the conference .
Meanwhile , the people &apos;s congress must be a congress created by a general election by the people of the entire nation and serve as the supreme power organ of the democratic republic of China .
Only such national defense conference and national congress will win the welcome , support , and participation of the people and place the great cause of saving the nation and the people on a firm foundation .
Otherwise , no matter how fancy the terms , it absolutely will not produce any practical benefit or gain the consent of the people .
The failure of the many conferences called by your party and your party government all along is the best evidence thereof .
those members of the Chinese Kuomintang who are patriotic and conscientious and who preserve , and are in the process of stimulating , the heroic bearing of the nation of China , We welcome their spirit of sacrifice and reform in face of the national crisis .
We know that many conscious and patriotic people exist in your Party Central and provincial party units , in your Central and provincial governments , in the fields of culture , education , science , art , journalism , industry , women , religion , medicine , and police , in all kinds of people &apos;s organizations , especially the broad troops , and among the new and old members of the Kuomintang and the leaders of all levels , and that such people are growing in number every day .
It is extremely encouraging .
The Chinese Communist Party members are ready at all times to associate with such Kuomintang members and organize together a national united front against the biggest enemy of the entire nation Japanese imperialism .
We hope that these Kuomintang members will promptly form a controlling power in the party , overcome those members who disregard the national interest and serve as agents of Japanese imperialism , who are pro @-@ Japanese spies and the worst and most shameful members of their party , and who constitute an insult to Mr Sun Yat @-@ sen , revive the spirit of Mr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s revolutionary three principles of democracy , restore his three great policies of allying with Russia , the communists , and the workers and peasants , implement , with their &quot; mind and talent , &quot; the three principles of democracy , the three great policies , and Mr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s last will , firmly shoulder the responsibility of continuing his revolutionary cause , resolutely expel Japanese imperialism together with the patriotic leaders and people of all parties , all factions , and all fields in the nation , and struggle against the destruction of China , for the democratic rights of the people , for the development of the national economy to relieve the greatest majority of the people from their miseries , and for the realization of a democratic republic of China and its democratic congress and a democratic government .
The Chinese Communist Party declares to all members of the Chinese Kuomintang : If you truly do so , we will firmly support you ; we will be willing to form with you a firm revolutionary united front , similar to the great united front against national and feudal oppression formed by the two parties in the first revolution of 1925 @-@ 1927 , because it is the only correct path to avert perdition and seek survival today .
Gentlemen and the entire Kuomintang membership , most likely you have not forgotten the glorious history of the cooperation between the two parties in the previous revolution .
As a result of such cooperation , all national and feudal oppressors trembled with fear before us .
The national oppressors at that time , especially Japanese Imperialism , deeply realized that our cooperation would lead to thorough victory and to the complete liberation of China .
Thus , they provoked and alienated , threatened and induced , and resorted to extreme measures , and finally they succeeded in provoking one side of the cooperation and put an end to the first united front .
When you gentlemen look into your conscience in the deep of the night , most probably you will heave a long sigh of regret .
Wow everyone knows
that , had the Chinese Kuomintang cooperated with the Chinese Communist Party to the final end , China would not have been in such a tragic situation today ; China would have been an independent and free country !
Today , the people of the entire nation hope urgently that the two parties will renew their cooperation and save the nation .
They believe that only a renewed cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and a general cooperation with all parties , all factions , and all fields in the nation will truly avert perdition and attain survival .
Nevertheless , Japanese imperialism and the spies and traitors will inevitably again attempt to sabotage such cooperation , because they know full well that such cooperation will deal them a fatal blow .
The &quot; three great principles &quot; centering oti &quot; anti @-@ communism &quot; proposed by Japanese imperialism to your party government is an attempt to forestall cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and to prepare to destroy any cooperation .
However , the issue is very clear .
Will you join Japanese imperialism and the spies to build an anti @-@ communist united fronta united front of national perdition ?
Or will you join the Chinese Communist Party and the people of the entire country to build a resist @-@ Japan united fronta national salvation united front ?
The moment of decision is here .
Any hesitation or vacillation is a loss to the state and the nation and a gain to Japanese imperialism .
The key to our cooperation is in the hands of your party .
As stated at the Second Central General Meeting of your party , in regard to the fate of the nation , your party has a responsibility .
If you are truly willing to shoulder the responsibility of saving the nation and seeking survival , now is the time to make the decision .
Once the nation is lost , there will be no point in discussing cooperation .
It will then be too late to regret !
As for us , we have long prepared to send our plenipotentiary delegates to any place at any time and discuss the concrete measures with the delegates of your party , in order to form promptly a concrete agreement to resist Japan and save the nation , and we will firmly abide by such agreement .
Once the united front between you and us , the united front among you and us and all the parties , factions , and fields in the nation , is successfully formed , then you and us and the people of the entire country will have the right to shout : Let the spies and traitors and all the spineless slaves shout in face of the might of Japanese imperialism that &quot; China is not capable of resisting Japan , &quot; but the children of the great nation of China will never surrender , never capitulate !
We will struggle for the independence and liberation of the great nation of China to the last drop of our blood !
China absolutely is not Abyssinia !
The nation of China of 450 million will one day stand up majestically in the east , raise high the banner of final victory of the national revolution , and , hand in hand with all free and liberated nations in the world , including the nation of Japan except its imperialist elements , control the entire globe !
Control the bright and brilliant new world !
Let our enemies tremble in face of our united front , for victory will be ours !
54We entend to you our national revolutionary salute !

LETTES FROM MAO TSE @-@ TUNG TO TS &apos;AI YUAN @-@ P &apos;EI 22 September 1936 .
_ -.- { Text &#93; Dear Mr Chieh @-@ min :
It has been 20 years since I listened respectfully to your noble discourses and magnificent theories in the classrooms of Peking University in the old capital during 4 May Movement period !
What kind of day is today ?
It is the day when the nation and the state are in desperation .
The old like those of your generation , the middle aged like me , and the young like today &apos;s students , without distinction of rich or poor , of workers , peasants , merchants , or students , or of beliefs and preferences , will all fall into the hands of foreign aggressors .
The rivers and mountains will no longer be our rivers and mountains ; the people will no longer be our people ; the cities will no longer be our cities .
Such catastrophe of national perdition and racial extinction is unprecedented since ancient times in the whole world .
How will you handle it ?
The Communist Party proposed creating a resist @-@ Japan united front .
As the people in the nation all find it feasible , you probably will also find it feasible .
However , some among those in power may find it infeasible or suggest postponement .
When the robbers enter the front door and one does not resist , when the tiger bites and one does not fight , when the people are led to a desperate situation , how will you handle it ?
Mr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s policy to ally with Russia , the communists , and the peasants and workers was effective in the first revolution of 19251927 .
The period of cooperation between the Kuomint , ang and the Communist Party was also the most revolutionary period of the Kuomintang .
When Mr Sun &apos;s revolutionary policy was abandoned , civil war became continuous and external troubles , similar to a broken dike , became untrollable !
Though only renewing a former proposal , the letter of 25 August from the Communist Party to the Kuomintang embodies actually the best means to avert perdition .
How will you handle it ?
In the &quot; New Literature &quot; opinion statements , the name which appears foremost is yours .
Seeing your name after 20 years , I feel a reverence and an Intimacy .
Mr Chieh @-@ min , you expounded a brandnew theory different from the general run of new and old
reactionaries .
You must realize that I was not the only one who rejoiced upon reading it , nor the Communist Party alone , but a countless number of people !
From comrades to friends , it is again doubtless that those who rejoice over your sympathy for the cause to resist Japan and save the nation are definitely not limited to myself , or the Communist Party , alone , but all the conscientious sous and daughters of the nation .
Nevertheless , one more step should be taken beyond the 100 @-@ foot pole and , if you take the lead with your sense of righteousness and make plans to block the wild tide at this critical moment of national perdition with your position as a great national leader of the Kuang @-@ fu and T &apos;ung @-@ meng Societies and an academic leader of the Peking University and the Central Research Institute , not just by words alone , but also by action , not just with sympathy , but also by advocation , and if you severely censure the Nanking government and ask it to stop the civil war immediately3 abandon its erroneous policies of compromise toward the external and harsh demands of the internal , abolish its national perdition policy of punishing the patriotic and rewarding the treacherous , launch the army , navy , and air force of the entire nation for a true resist @-@ Japan war , revive the spirit of Mr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s revolutionary three principles of democracy and three great policies , rescue our 450 million compatriots from deep water and searing &apos;fire , call a resist @-@ Japan national salvation congress of all parties , all factions , all fields , and all military units , convene a national congress .elected by the people , establish a national defense government united against the external , build a true democratic republic , place the country in a powerful and prosperous position , and promote the nation among the free and liberated , then , your name will shine through 1,000 generations , spread among the people of the whole nation , and become a household word .
Instead of reducing in the least bit the enthusiasm of those who hear your words several thousand li away , you will enhance it .
Please remember me to Messrs and Mesdames Sung Ch &apos;ing @-@ ling , Ho Hsiang @-@ ning , Li Shih @-@ tseng , Wu Chih @-@ hui , Chang P &apos;u @-@ ch &apos;uan , Yu Yu @-@ jen , Sun Che @-@ sheng , Chu Chueh @-@ hsien , T &apos;an Li @-@ ming , Liu Ya @-@ tzu , Shao Li @-@ tzu , Wang Ching @-@ wei , Ch &apos;en Pi @-@ chun , Ching Heng @-@ yi , Ch &apos;en Kung @-@ po , Ku Meng @-@ yu , Tseng Chung @-@ ming , Kan Nai @-@ kuang , Chang Ching @-@ chiang , Tai Chi @-@ t &apos;ao , Ch &apos;en Kuo @-@ fu , Ting Wei @-@ fen , Sung Tzu @-@ wen , Ch &apos;en Shu @-@ jen , Ch &apos;u Min @-@ yi , P &apos;eng Tse @-@ min , Li Jen @-@ ch &apos;ao , Li Te @-@ lin , Ch &apos;en Yu @-@ jen , Tsou Hai @-@ pin , Hsu Chi @-@ lung , Chu Chi @-@ chfing , Pai Yun @-@ tTi , En @-@ k &apos;o @-@ pa @-@ tTu , Li Fu @-@ lin , Ch &apos;en Hu @-@ fang , Ch &apos;eng Sung @-@ yun , T &apos;ang Meng @-@ hsiao , Chu Yi @-@ chih , Li Hsieh @-@ ho , Po Lieh @-@ wu , Liu Chen @-@ huan , T &apos;an Yi @-@ ju , Chang Chih @-@ pen , Feng Tzu @-@ yu , Hsieh Hui @-@ sheng , Mao Tsu @-@ ch &apos;uan , Chiang Hsi @-@ yen , K &apos;ung Keng , Kuo Mo @-@ jo , Shen Yen @-@ ping , Ch &apos;en Wang @-@ tao , Li Ho @-@ ming , Hu Shih @-@ chih , Chang Hsing @-@ yen , Chou Tso @-@ jen , Ch &apos;ien Chieh @-@ p &apos;an , Fu Szu @-@ nien , Lo Chia @-@ lun , Tuan Hsi @-@ p &apos;eng , Ch &apos;en Pao @-@ o , Chang Tung @-@ sun , PTeng Yi @-@ hu , P &apos;eng Ch &apos;uan @-@ fang , Yang Tuan @-@ liu , Hu Tzu @-@ ching , Ch &apos;en Feng @-@ huang , Chou Ku @-@ ch &apos;eng , Shu Hsin @-@ ch &apos;eng , and all my old friends of the party and the state , academic teachers .and friends , and friends in society .
As the catastrophe is imminent , I hastily present my opinions .
Sharing the same boat in wind and rain , I hope to hear your instructions .
I wish you good health .

0 &quot; On the United FrontOur Advocation To Resist Japan and Save the Nation in the Past Year , &quot; mimeographed ( - * hand copied ) January 1937
EDITORIALCHAIRMAN MAO &apos;S TALKS 15 October 1936
&#91; Text &#93; Soviet Central Government Chairman Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung today publishes his talks : &quot; The Soviet Central Government and the People &apos;s Red Army Military Commission have issued an order .
11 ( 1 ) All Red Army units will cease any attack of the National Revolutionary Army .
&quot; ( 2 ) They are only permitted to take the necessary measures of self @-@ defense when attacked .
&quot; ( 3 ) All the personnel and weaponry of the National Revolutionary Army captured by us when it attacked us will be returned when the said army starts to resist Japan .
Those who wish to join the Red Army may do so .
&quot; ( 4 ) There may be no interference when the National Revolutionary Army is being shifted to resist @-@ Japan positions , and all possible aid must be rendered .
We have decided to again earnestly request all units of the National Revolutionary Army and the Nanking Government to stop the civil war against us and resist Japan together .
The request is now being drafted .
As currently the situation of Chahar , Suiyuan , and Shansi is critical to the extreme , we eagerly hope to cooperate with the Nanking Government in order to reach the goal of aiding Suiyuan and resisting Japan , and averting perdition and seeking survival .
If the Nanking Government feels a sincere concern over the national calamity , stops the civil war , and sends troops to resist Japan , the Soviet wishes to aid it with its full power , and it is also willing to make the main force of the Red Army in the entire nation serve as the vanguard for a decisive battle against the Japanese bandits . &quot;
The people here find Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung &apos;s talks published today unsurpassable in earnestness and sincerity .
Japanese imperialism and the spies are creating rumors every day , in an attempt to prove that the Soviet Red Army &apos;s proposal for a resist @-@ Japan united front is merely a means to
overthrow the Kuomintang .
Chairman Mao &apos;s words today have quashed by one stroke such rumors and slander .
We know that his words will clear up the doubts in the minds of the patriotic elements in the Kuomintang and the National Revolutionary Army , because the Red Army has declared , through Chairman Maoa that it has no intention to capture the personnel and weaponry of any unit of the National Revolutionary Army , nor to eliminate its troops or overthrow the Kuomintang Hanking Government .
The goal of the Soviet Government is to unite China by peaceful means , form a democratic republic of China , and expel Japanese imperialism from the country .
Such advocation has now been made extremely clear .

LETTER FROM MAO TSE @-@ TUNG , CHU TEH , AND OTHERS TO CHIANG KAI @-@ SHEK 1 December 1936
&#91; Text &#93; Dear Mr.
Kai @-@ shek :
Since August of last year , the Communist Party Soviet and the Red Army have asked you many times to stop the civil war and fight the Japanese together .
Response was unanimous from all parties and factions but you continued to pursue your own way , first by ordering the encirclement and suppression as manifested by the campaign of Chi @-@ luo &#91; 4160 0925 &#93; township last winter .
When we attempted to march toward the Hopeh @-@ Chahar front by crossing eastward over the Yellow River , you blocked us at the Fen &#91; 3083 &#93; river basin .
As we did not wish to expend the strength of our national defense needlessly , we headed west to find other means to oppose the Japanese , and , at the same time , published a proclamation to bring you to your senses .
In the past several months the situation in eastern Suiyuan .
has become critical .
Then we thought you would change course and dispatch massive forces to carry out the war of opposition against Japan .
But who was to know that instead you sent only eight regiments under T &apos;ang En @-@ po &#91; 3282 1869 0130 &#93; to succor Suiyuan while amassing a huge force of 260 regiments under the command of Hu Tsung @-@ nan &#91; 5170 1350 0589 &#93; , Kuan Ling @-@ cheng &#91; 7070 7792 1767 &#93; Mao Ping @-@ wen &#91; 3029 3621 2429 &#93; , Hang Chun &#91; 3769 0971 &#93; , Ho Chu @-@ kuo &#91; 5516 2691 0365 &#93; , Wang I @-@ che &#91; 3769 0110 0772 &#93; , Tung Ying @-@ pin &#91; 5516 5391 2430 &#93; , Sun Chen &#91; 1327 7201 &#93; , Wan Yao @-@ huang &#91; 8001 5069 3552 &#93; , Yang Hu @-@ ch &apos;eng &#91; 2799 5706 1004 &#93; , Ma Hung @-@ pin &#91; 7456 7703 6333 &#93; , Ma @-@ Pu @-@ fang &#91; 7456 2965 5364 &#93; , Kao Kuei @-@ tzu &#91; 7559 2710 3320 &#93; , Kao Shuang @-@ ch &apos;eng &#91; 7559 7175 2052 &#93; , Li Hsien @-@ chou &#91; 2621 0103 3166 &#93; , and others to form a savage army intent upon destroying the Red Army opposing Japan and savaging the Soviet areas battling the Japanese .
We could not return in kind the hatred .you have built up in your heart so we ordered our Red Army to stop attacking your troops and to retreat step , by step in order to protect ourselves and our bases of opposition against Japan and we loathe its plundering offensives against us .
Our enthusiasm is at its peak to aid the officers and soldiers fighting against the Japanese at Suiyuan .
You , on the other hand , have concentrated all your forces to engage in a civil war of killing each other .
Being in the field ourselves we know only too well the feelings and sentiments of the rank and file of the armies in the northwest , and there is no difference between theirs and ours .
We greatly desire
to stop this suicidal civil war and go forth into the battlefield of war against Japan at an early date .
Look at your own troops known as the crack brigade .
They were unable to avoid the tragedy of the Shan Ch &apos;eng Pao &#91; -1472 1004 0202 &#93; campaign .
The reason is not that they were unable to fight but that they were unwilling to have Chinese fight Chinese and would rather surrender their weapons to the Red Army .
Why do you not spend a night to analyze the differences between the objectives sought by the people and by the military and find the reason for it ?
Take heed of the worsening situation in Suiyuan , the weakness of the forces manning the fronts , the war of opposition along the Great Wall and the 28 January Campaign of Shanghai .
The world is in turmoil .
It rests on your honor , alone to make the critical decision .
It will come from you , and you alone , whether the civil war will end today and tomorrow , the Red Army , together with the mighty forces assembled by you in the northwest for suppression purposes , will march to the fronts of opposition against Japan .
This will increase the defensive strength of Suiyuan a dozen times over , and it will enable us to avenge , the nation , protect our lands , and recover lost territories .
You will then be regarded as a glorious hero opposing the Japanese and the fragrance of your fame will remain for a hundred generations .
Why don &apos;t you then take such a course ?
We have the courage to once more beg you in all sincerity to make a decisive decision and grant us our request to save the nation , transform enmity into friendship , and fight the Japanese together .
This will not be a great good fortune for us alone , but it will also be the only way out for the people of the entire country .
Today we have but two choices , fight or surrender to the Japanese .
Vacillation will only bring about the destruction of the nation , slavery to us , loss of the faith of the nation , and eternal damnation .
We do not wish to see later generations pointing at us and saying that the man who betrayed China was Chiang Kai @-@ shek .
Instead , we want the people of China to remember you as a hero who reformed in time to save the nation and the people .
It is said , &quot; Fear not to correct your errors , &quot; and it is also said , &quot; the butcher who lays down his knife at once becomes a Buddha . &quot; We sincerely hope your honor will observe with care which path is to be taken .
We wait with impatience your weighty decisions and knowledgeable counsel and of your intentions .

LETTER TO COMRADE LIN PIAO 1936
&#91; Text &#93; Comrade Lin Piao :
I am in full agreement with your letter .
However , there is something I would like to add with regard to the cultural and educational aspects of the third section that form the most fundamental part of the entire educational plan ( the nurturing of multiple abilities in the recognition of words , composition , reading of books , newspapers , etc . ) - It follows that the tool of culture is part of the &quot; Practical &quot; in accordance with the theory of equal importance of theory and practice you propounded .
A studentrs further development will be restricted when he leaves school with everything learned but without the ability to read books and compose .
Even though he has learned all that has to be learned , though not much in quantity or depth , but is able to read books and compose , then he will have a basic foundation of things which will be in frequent use after he leaves school .
If you concur -with this proposal I would suggest that in the next 4 months increase the curriculum on culture ( recognition of words , reading books , composition , and other departments ) in the second and third sections .
I would like this to be increased to one @-@ fourth or one @-@ third of the entire study period ( including the period for self @-@ study ) .
Please give thought to this problem , and make culture an important criteria at the time of scheduled examination .
Salute .

LETTEK TO OLD COMRADE HSU February 1937
&#91; Text &#93; Old Comrade Hsu :
Twenty years ago you were ray teacher , you are still my teacher now , and you will still be my teacher in the future .
When the revolution met with failure many of the Communist Party members deserted the Party and some of them even went over to the side of the enemy .
In the fall of 1927 you joined the Communist Party , and the attitude you adopted was very much that of an activist .
In comparison with many young , robust Communist Party members you were even more active , even more fearless of difficulties , and even more eager to studiously learn about new things during the long , arduous period of struggle since that time to the present .
All the obstacles and difficulties &#91; associated with &#93; old age and senility and feebleness have melted from in front of you .
What about the others ?
They used these as excuses for not doing anything .
You know much but frequently find yourself lacking while it is &quot; half a canteen of water &quot; pretending to be &quot; a full one &quot; with others .
You are a thinking man , and you do what you say , but for others , something unclean hides in a corner of their hearts .
You are with the masses at all times , but others are happy to be separated from the masses .
In every way you showed yourself to be a model of obedience to the discipline of the Party and the revolution , while for others discipline is something to be applied to restrict others , and they themselves are exceptions .
You are first for the revolution , first for work , and your first consideration is for others .
Others put publicity , recreation , and themselves first .
You always select difficult tasks to perform and you have never shirked your responsibilities .
There are people who only want to select the easy and light tasks , and shirk responsibilities .
In all these I have great respect for you .
I am willing to emulate you , and also hope all the comrades in the Party learn from you .
On your 60th birthday I am sending this letter to you as a greeting .
I wish you good health and long life , and I hope you will become the model for all members of the revolutionary party and for the people of the nation .
I give you my revolutionary salute .

TALK ON SINO @-@ JAPANESE PROBLEMS AND THE SIAN INCIDENT 1 March 1937
&#91; Text &#93; On 1 March , the American authoress Smedley visited the Soviet area .
and met with Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung at Yenan .
They talked of the Sino @-@ Japanese problems and the Sian Incident ; the highlights of this conversation are as follows :
Smedley : Have there been any basic changes in the United Front policy now implemented by the Communist Party and the one that was discussed with Mr.
Snow last fall ?
Mao : Speeking from a basic viewpoint , there have been no changes , as manifested in the following :
Our United Front is anti @-@ Japanese , therefore it is not against all imperialism but against Japanese imperialism because it is now launching aggression against China .
However , we ask the British , the United States , France , and the Soviet Union to be sympathetic toward China &apos;s anti @-@ Japanese movement , on at least not to oppose it .
We are willing to establish friendly relations on these fundamental points .
Our United Front is a national one .
It means that with the exception of traitors it includes the entire nation , all parties and factions , and all classes .
It has been said that the Communist Party promoted the people &apos;s front , but this is incorrect .
The Communist Party promoted a national front .
In comparison with the popular fronts of France and Spain this kind of national front has a greater scope .
Therefore , the principal political program of this anti @-@ Japanese National Front should include the following :
Domestic peace and unity ;
Fighting a war of resistance against Japan ;
Democratic freedom for the people&apos;
The Nanking government is to be transformed into a true government of national defense which absorbs all parties and factions and oust the pro @-@ Japanese faction ;
Change in the system of government should be based upon a democratic republic with general elections for the national assembly ;
Improve the.people &apos;s livelihood ;
Develop industry and commerce ;
Unite with those countries In sympathy with the Chinese resistance against Japan .
Smedley : To what degree are you willing to sacrifice in order to bring the anti @-@ Japanese National United Front to fruition ?
Mao : A historical perspective Is necessary .
Since the beginning of the summer of 1927 , the Kuotnintant cast aside the United Front of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party , discarded Dr.
Sun Yatsen &apos;s policy of uniting with Russia , the Communist Party , and the peasants and workers , threw away the political program of national independence and democratic freedom and also took a diametrically opposite course .
This compelled us to reluctantly take up the responsibility of the Chinese revolution alone and to implement Soviet political power and the policy of agrarian revolution , thereby placing us in opposition to the Kuomintang .
The policy adopted then , and which was In opposition against the Kuomintang , was entirely correct and necessary .
However , following the 18 September Incident , the Communist Party published a proclamation requesting an end to the civil war and announced its willingness to contract an agreement under the three conditions with the Kuomintang to have internal peace and carry out a war of resistance against Japan .
But only the 19th Route Army agreed with our proposal at that time while the Nanking government refused to do so completely and , at the same time , launched a massive encirclement and suppression campaign .
When the North China incident erupted and the peril to the nation reached its most critical point , we further published on 1 August 1935 the proclamation to organize an anti @-@ Japanese allied army and a government of national defense .
In December of the same year we published a program for organizing an anti @-@ Japanese National United Front Party and also set forth the guidelines for the United Front .
This new policy was Immediately accepted by the masses upon its proclamation , and many patriotic elements in the Kuomintang likewise agreed with and accepted this policy .
This was because we were facing an even larger enemy and only by ending the .
civil war could we carry out the war of resistance against Japan and gain revenge .
This set a new stage in Chinese politics .
But the Kuomintang was still unwilling to discard its old policies .
Last August we again wrote a long letter to the Kuomintang resolutely demanding that the target of antagonism be shifted from the internal one to that of the Japanese aggressors , that the three great policies of Dr.
Sun Yat @-@ sen
be revived , and also set forth the idea of transforming the national system into a democratic republic , convening a .general election of the national assembly , to request it to repent the past and make a new beginning with the people .
We announced that the Soviet area was willing to implement a similar democratic system throughout the nation .
This letter received wide support from among the Kuomintang , but the central government of the Kuomintang did not answer our letter .
The Sian Incident exploded and the nation was faced with a major crisis .
The .danger lies in the fact , that Japan will seize this opportunity to launch its offensive , and the peaceful solution of this matter was indeed an act of providence .
In order to consolidate internal peace and quickly launch the .
war of resistance against Japan , we sent an important cable to the Kuomintang on 10 February on the eve of the opening of the Kuomintang &apos;s Third Plenary Session .
The cable carried the following points :
The Soviet Government will become the Government of the Special Region of the Republic of China , and the Red Army will become the National Revolutionary Army which will also be under the direction of the Nanking Government and the Military Commission .
A thoroughly democratic system.is to be implemented within the territories of the Government of the Special Region .
The policy of overthrowing the national government shall cease in the country ( this guideline was implemented last year , and we are reiterating this only ) .
The policy of confiscating the land of the landlords will be discontinued .
These new expressions were for the sole purpose of dispelling doubts among the various circles and nullifying the opposition in order to establish the Anti @-@ Japanese Nation United Front with the Kuomintang .
As for the Kuomintang , a program was set forth requesting a basic change.in their former policies , waging war against the foreigners , practicing democracy domestically , and improving the livelihood of the people .
Smedley : How are you going to implement the principle of your United Front here and in other areas ?
For instance , toward businessmen , the intelligentsia , landlords , peasants , workers , soldiers , and other aspects .
Mao : There is not much difference now as in the past with regard to businessmen .
From the outset we proposed the development of national industry and commerce , and wherever the Red Army goes they protect the businessmen .
The Red Army won acclaim recently when they not only protected the businessmen but did not even confiscate land from a single landlord when they were in the area around Sian .
and Sanyuan .
This is a well publicized affair .
As for the Soviet area , commerce has complete freedom within it .
As in the past the present policy is to protect the intelligentsia , giving preference treatment to technicians , literary persons , and artists .
Our attitude toward them is of respect .
We do not confiscate , the land of the landlords so long as they do not oppose the policy of war against the Japanese and save the nation .
With regard to workers we adopted various methods to improve their treatment .
On the question of our attitude toward the Kuomintang troops , we should unite in a friendly manner under the national front , especially with the Whampoa troops with their glorious history , fight the Japanese together with our guns pointed against the foreign enemies , and stop all internal wars .
Although the Red Army has fought the Kuomintang for 10 years , we are not bitter against them at all , and we are willing to shake hands with them and fight for the defense of the nation under a unified command , and we believe they hold similar feelings * We are all willing to consult the Kuomintang and people from various circles with regard.to the aforementioned policies in order to reach a unanimous concensus of opinion and make this a guideline of the various important articles regarding policies against Japan , the system of government , and others , including all of them within the program of the national front so that they will be implemented throughout the country .
Smedley : Does the new policy of the United Front mean.taht Chinese Communist Party members will forego class struggle and become democratic for the sake of establishing the national front ?
Mao : As I have said before , the practical policies that the Communist Party has decided to carry out have the sole objective of truly opposing the Japanese and defending the nation .
Therefore , domestic peace must be realized and the situation of two regimes in opposition eliminated , otherwise a war of resistance against Japan will not be possible .
This is known as minority interests taking a subordinate position to majority interests , placing class interests in subordination to national interests .
All political parties and individuals in the country , should understand this important significance .
Communists will not chain their own viewpoints to that of the interests of one class of the moment .
Instead , they are very sincerely concerned about the interests of the entire country and of all the people , and they are also concerned about long @-@ range interests .
With regard to class struggle ^ it is our opinion to suitably resolve this problem through endeavors on both sides as follows :
First , with regard to landlords and capitalists , they are wealthy and have power .
They must first of all respect the national interest and take steps to improve the livelihood and treatment of workers and peasants .
This is because if they carry on as before perpetrating unhuman oppression and exploitation of workers and peasants caring only for the interests of their own and of one class , then it will not be possible for the workers and peasants to exist , let alone fighting a war of resistance .
The nation will be lost and the landlords and capitalists will also become colonial slaves .
Therefore , landlords and capitalists with the least bit of conscience should express their love for the nation and agree to the improvement of the economic and politic life of the workers and peasants made necessary by the war of resistance to save the country .
There definitely cannot have a situation in which
only they have food to eat while the workers and peasants do not , and only they have political freedom while the workers and peasants have none .
I believe that the running dogs of the Japanese , that is the traitorous elements , are the only ones who do not care for the general situation and the interests of the nation .
Even at this crucial point of national and racial extinction they still put all their efforts into oppressing and exploiting the workers and peasants .
With regard to this aspect of the demands , we have already presented them to the Kuomintang on behalf of the workers and peasants of the entire country , and the Kuomintang should have a satisfactory answer for us for the sake of the general situation and the national interest .
Second , the masses of poor and suffering workers and peasants are without wealth and power , but they are the foundation of the nation and the largest class .
And at this crucial point of national and racial extinction , their most important task , similarly , is to resist the Japanese and defend the nation .
Furthermore , they will become the main force for the war of resistance against Japan for national salvation which , without them will not be possible .
When their economic life and political life have been reformed , their dissatisfaction with the landlords and capitalists and the Kuomintang will lessen .
The workers and peasants , too , must also take into consideration the general situation and the national interests , therefore , we do not propose to make any demands which are not suitable to the war of resistance to save the nation .
It is because for this very reason that the Communist Party proposed the improvement of people &apos;s livelihood and cessation of the confiscation of land .
There is no doubt at all that these policies set forth by the Chinese Communist Party are patriotic in nature .
Some say , the communists are internationalists and do not care for national interests nor do they desire to defend the fatherland .
This is complete nonsense .
The communists are internationalists and are in favor of the one world movement .
But at the same time , they are patriots defending the fatherland .
For the sake of defending the fatherland they are willing to shed their last drop of blood .
The 15 @-@ year national liberation struggle led by the Communist Party is known by everyone .
This kind of patriotism and internationalism are not in conflict , because only with an independent and liberated China can there be participation in the one world movement .
Smedley : What will the conditions for peace with Japan be if the Chinese National Front Government is established ?
Should talks still be held between China and Japan ?
Mao : If Japan desires peace we will not reject negotiations and our conditions for .
peace will be as follows :
First , Japan is to abolish its policy of aggression against China and abrogate its so @-@ called mainland policy and the Three Principles of Hirota , respect the independence of China and relations between the two countries will be as equals .
Second , abolish the Yin Ju @-@ keng eastern Hopeh government , Manchukuo , and return of the four provinces of Northeast China , and Northern Chahar .
Third , withdraw the troops garrisoning North China .
Fourth , stop Japanese airplanes from flying freely all over China .

Fifth , abolish all intelligence organizations in the various areas of China .
Sixth , prohibit violent and irresponsible attitudes extended by Japanese toward the Chinese within the boundaries of China .
Seventh , cease smuggling .
Peace talks should.be carried out only under the condition that the Japanese agree to discuss these conditions .
All negotiations leading to the sacrifice of sovereignty of Chinese territories will be opposed .
.However , you should understand that only with the establishment of a people &apos;s government in Japan can talks be carried out based on these conditions .
Currently , Japan has a military government and such possibilities do not exist .
Smedley : Is the war against Japan inevitable ?
Mao : It is unavoidable .
Before the people of Japan overthrow their militarist government Japan will not desist in her aggression policies , therefore , war is unavoidable .
The threat of war is further intensified with the pact between Germany and Japan .
Smedley : The Japanese say that cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party in China is an obstacle to peace in the Far East .
What is your answer to this theory ?
Mao : The so @-@ called &quot; Peace in the Far East &quot; claimed by the Japanese militarists means that China should not resist but let Japan occupy it , taking it over as it pleases .
At the same time those countries like Britain , the United States of America , and France who are concerned with the Chinese question also should not oppose them .
This is &quot; a country lost without a fight , &quot; and it is the &quot; Peace in the Far East &quot; that the Japanese militarists want .
But there is another kind of peace in the Far East , and that is to carry out the steps I mentioned beforeJapan is to abolish its policy of aggression , return the four northeastern provinces , withdraw its garrison troops , etc . , so that the Chinese people can live peacefully , and peaceful commerce can begin between China and the various countries of the world .
Of course , this is another kind of peace in the Far East .
This is the only true peace which , the Chinese people want , and which is also needed by all peaceful countries throughout the world .
It is also something that the people of Japan want .
It is only the Japanese militarists and their allies in aggression , Germany and Italy , the two fascist .countreis that do not want this kind of peace .
Therefore , we can put it this way : The &quot; Peace in the Far East &quot; we oppose is the former
kind , and the one we approve of is of the latter kind of peace , and we propose substituting the latter kind of peace for the former .
This is because the &quot; peace &quot; that is on the lips of the Japanese militarists is another name for war , and it is a synonym of slavery for the Chinese people .
It is another name which threatens all the other peaceful countries of the world , and , by the same token , will bring the greatest harm to the Japanese people .
In my view we should &quot; obstruct &quot; this &quot; peace . &quot;
Smedley : Does contradiction exist between world peace and the Sino @-@ Japanese war : .Can a point of amelioration be found ?
Mao : Of course there is .
The majority of the people and the countries of the world desire peace , but the Japanese militarists hope for war .
This kind of contradiction cannot be reconciled in accordance with the program of the Japanese .
There is only one way to resolve this contradiction and that is for the peaceful countries of the world to join with China to oppose Japan &apos;s policy of aggression , compelling the Japanese militarists to bow to world opinion .
In another respect , if war cannot be avbided China should fight resolutely in resistance .
Only these methods will be compatible with world peace .
The foundation of world peace can be established only on the policy of stopping and opposing aggression .
Smedley : Do you think such peace treaties as the Nine @-@ Power Treaty , the Kellogg @-@ Briand Pact and .league pact will be able to stop Japan declaring war against China ?
What impact will these treaties have in the Sino @-@ Japanese war ?
And what are their significance ?
Mao : Today , it looks like as if these treaties truly express a hope for peace , therefore , the aggressor countries have manifested their determined opposition .
But such treaties will only have the force of moral restriction of an aggressor country such as Japan .
It will not be possible to stop them from declaring war against China .
These treaties will have no influence on the Sino @-@ Japanese war , therefore , it does not have any practical political significance .
A new treaty must be available if it is desirable to stop Japan warring against China , and this treaty must include concrete measures to take forceful action against the aggressive violence of Japan , of the kind similar to the collective security of the Pacific that was negotiated .
Only this kind of treaty can truly stop wars , and when wars erupt , they can also be quickly extinguished .
Smedley : Can China immediately go to war against Japan after the United Front Government has been established ?
Or will a considerable period of preparation be needed ?
Mao : This depends on Japan .
Regardless of when China is attacked by the Japanese , it should offer resistance immediately .
However , we do not propose to provoke Japan .
Since our policy is defensive warfare , we should rapidly set about making preparations , in all respects .thoroughly so that China will be able to handle any incident at any time .
We are not against preparation , but we do oppose &quot; long @-@ term preparation &quot; which seeks compromise under the pretext of preparation .
Smedley : Will the resources and finances available to the Chinese people be adequate to launch a victorious war of resistance against Japan without international aid , and can China shoulder the responsibilities of the finances and economics of war ?
Mao : China must fight the war of resistance even without friendly troops , and with the resources and natural conditions China has prolonged warfare can be sustained .
The 10 years of the Red Army ? s fighting history is living proof .
But we are seeking friendly forces because Japan already has its bandit allies , and China cannot elect for isolation , and on this basis we propose that the five countries of China , Bxitain , the United States , France and Russia set up an allied Pacific Front .
This kind of allied war front is to assist China , and , at the same time , it is mutual help .
JapanTs aggression is not only China &apos;s misfortune but also that of the world , as Germany is a great catastrophe to the world , , and since these two aggressor countreis have formed an alliance , I fe ; el that the five countries of China , Britain , the United States , France and Russia should quickly unite , as one or else face being destroyed one by one .
,
Smedley : Under the present circumstancesthat is , under the situation of Italian @-@ German @-@ Japanese alliancewhat impact will such a war have on the economy , finances , and commerce of Japan ?
Can Japan carry this war through successfully with the .assistance of these two countries ?
Mao : It is absolutely of no benefit to the Japanese people for Japan to carry out aggression against China .
The final result of Japan &apos;s war against China will be the financial , economical , and political collapse of Japan .
This fact is understood not only by the Japanese people , but even those bourgeoisie with foresight , but the Japanese militarists are completely blind to it .
The Japanese militarists have already formed a world @-@ wide league for aggression , and they hope to receive help from Italy and Germany in coordinated offensives .
They hope to carry through the war of aggression against China using this method and get hold of the entire world as well .
Of course their dream is perfect and satisfactory , but in my view , the end result will not be that way .
The Chinese people should have the confidence of overcoming the Japanese in warfare .
Smedley : Why did the Communist Party elect for a peaceful solution to the Sian Incident ?
This was a complete surprise and we hope you will give us an explanation .
Mao : It is not an event that is out of expections , but entirely within reason .
It is simply that nobody connected it with the political proposals set forth in the past by the Communist Party .
With the beginning of the Japanese aggression we have been.willing to stop the civil , war since only with internal peace can there be an anti @-@ Japanese war of resistance .
In such things as the announcement 4 years ago that we were ready to contract an agreement with the Kuomintang troops @-@ to fight the Japanese under the three conditions set forth , the proclamation made on 1 August of last year , and last year &apos;s letter to the Kuomintang all expressed our sincere desire
to establish a new United Front with the Kuomintang .
During the Sian Incident there were people in the country who vigorously fomented civil war and the seriousness of it was critical .
A peaceful solution would not have been possible without Chang Han @-@ ch &apos;ing accompanying Mr.
Chiang Kai @-@ shek back to Nanking on 25 December and follow up steps taken in accordance with Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s handling of the Sian Incident .
Soldiers would have been everywhere and to what disastrous ending it would bring nobody would know .
But it would provide the Japanese , with the best opportunity for aggression , and because of this China might have been lost , or at least most grieviously harmed .
When the Sian Incident occurred , the Japanese militarists and some Chinese from the areas of Nanking , Shanghai , Peiping , and Tientsin claimed that it was a communist plot .
That was completely false .
The incident rose from differences in political views within the Kuomintang on the questions of resisting Japan and domestic reforms , and it was an incident that erupted suddenly of which we had no prior knowledge .
After the incident there was opposition between Nanking and Shensi , and again there were people who claimed that the Communist Party was turning Sian.into another Madrid .
This is again completely at odds with reality .
The political circumstances between the Chinese and the Spanish are fundamentally different .
In Spain there was no other recourse but civil war , but in China , today , the only objective is to wage a war of resistance against outsiders , and there must be peace domestically .
The peaceful solution to the Sian Incident has proved that these claims were mere conjectures and some of them were outright malicious lies .
Smedley : Many people claim that the Sian Incident was concocted by the Communist Party , and that red flags flew high over the walls of Sian .
They also accuse the Red Army of seizing young men and women in the Sanyuan area .
What are the facts of this case ?
Mao : Red flags on Sian &apos;s walls must have been seen only by the Japanese and traitors , for they have yet to be seen by the people of Sian .
As for seizing young men and women of Sanyuan , this must also have originated from the Japanese and traitors , and the truth can be found only by asking the young men and women of Sanyuan .
In official documents it is still asserted that the Red Army kills and burns , oppressing the people and destroying the rural areas .
They have repeated this over and over again for 10 years and they are still not tired of it and must say it again .
Of course the person who made the statement has the freedom of speech , but the people of all China also have the freedom to look at the facts themselves .
The government has not promulgated a law prohibiting people to take a look at facts with their own.eyes , and anybody can go to those places where the Red Army has passed through or been stationed to see for themselves what the facts really are and there is no need for me to talk more about this .
Smedley : It is going the rounds that the policy of the Communist Party is to concede to the Kuomintang , surrendering to them and be repentent .
What are your , views on this ?
Mao : I know there are people outside saying this , but of note is that the Japanese are not willing to say that .
The Japanese want the Kuoraintang and the Communist Party to fight each other , and they are absolutely against this kind of &quot; concede , surrender , and @-@ repent &quot; policy .
Because the Japanese militarists deeply understand that regardless of whether people called it &quot; conceding , surrendering , and repenting , &quot; such a policy adopted by the Communist Party toward the Kuofflintang would mean in practice dealing a heavy blow against the Japanese policy of aggression .
In viewing the Chinese problem there is one standard , and that is the Japanese will definitely oppose any policy that is revolutionary , and they will welcome any policy that is counterrevolutionary .
It is only necessary to look at what the attitude of the Japanese is in order to investigate the correctness of any policy or action .
By just taking a look at the .
way the Japanese oppose the @-@ so @-@ called policy of &quot; conceding , surrender , and repentence &quot; will verify how revolutionary our policy is .
The Communist Party requests the Kuomintang to and their 10 @-@ year @-@ old policy and change to the new policy of national revolution and democratic revolution .
These requests were expressed in the cable sent to the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang congress concerning the convening of a national salvation congress , democratic freedom for the people , improvement of the people &apos;s livelihood , rapid preparations for a war of resistance , and other matters ..
Under these circumstances the Communist Party is willing to change the names of its Soviets and the Red Army , and its opposition against the Kuomintang , and cease confiscating land from the landlords .
These measures are without doubt a .major concession made by the Communist Party to the Kuomintang .
However , this concession was necessary because it is based on an even greater and more important principle , which is the urgency and need to resist Japan and save the country .
This is known as mutual concession , and joint unity .
With regard to the resistance against Japan , the intelligent people in the Kuomintang leadership and party members understood this significance .
But there are people within the country possessing the Ah Q spirit who go about boasting that the concessions we made is &quot; conceding , surrender , and repentence . &quot; It iw well known that Lu Hsun , who passed away recently , wrote a story about a person known as Ah Q.
This Ah Q is always victorious under any circumstances , although it would have been failure for others .
Let them say what they wish , there are Ah Q &apos;s throughout the world .
Besides , there are personages suffering from / Jleft tending gullibility &quot; and you can find them everywhere .
Sun Ming @-@ chiu &#91; 1327 06S2 0046 &#93; , who shot and killed Wang Yi @-@ che &#91; 3769 0110 0772 &#93; , is an extreme example of such people .
Theirs is patriotic enthusiasm , and they are sorrowed by the historical tragedy of losing political power and home territories .
They are pure hearted people but they lack political experience .
They are unable to orient themselves when major events occur ; they do not understand the relationship of the part to the whole in a situation , and they cannot distinguish the past from the present , the difference between today and tomorrow , and the connection between them .
First , they opposed Mr Chiang &apos;s return to Nanking ; later they oppose peaceful solution to the incident .
As with regard to Sian , some of the people not only do not understand the Communist Party , but also do not understand Chang &#91; 1728 &#93; , Yang &#91; 2799 &#93; and others who supported peace .
They do not understand that although progress by the Kuomintang was slow , a united resistance against Japan still exists .
In the Kuomintang and within
the national revolutionary army the anti @-@ Japan fervor is mounting daily .
The majority of the leaders and party members can join us and the people to work together for the cause of anti @-@ Japanese national salvation war .
The sincerity of the changes in the Kuomintang policies have yet to satisfy the people but a beginning has been made .
From the resolution of the third plenary session comes evidence of these changes .
They do not know how to make distinctions between the majority of those patriots and possible patriots within the Kuomintang from those elements that are actually betraying the nation , the so @-@ called pro @-@ Japanese faction , and they have these two mixed up .
They also do not understand that the responsibility of all progressive elements in the country is to persuade those who do not understand our viewpoints for the moment and bring.them around to an understanding so that we can face the common enemy .
There must be patience in this work , and at times there must be concessions .
So long as it does not go against the cardinal principle of anti @-@ Japanese national salvation there is space for consultations .
We can only submit the aforementioned self @-@ criticism to those who have a high degree of impatience and do not understand our policies .
But for those whose only thought is personal and group benefits and who have pushed national interests out of their minds , this will be no self @-@ criticism regardless of whether they are the.pro @-@ Japanese faction or those giving lip service to resistance against Japan .
It is also not a matter of a few words of sarcasm directed against them but a means to expose their schemes and prevent them from plying their trade .
Smedley : What is your attitude toward the Three People &apos;s Principles ?
Mao : We have come to believe in the Three People &apos;s Principles long ago , otherwise how could we join the Kuomintang from 1925 to 1927 ?
Many of the members of the Communist Party have been members of the Kuomintang &apos;s Central Committee and provincial party committee members .
I was one of them , as well as Lin Po @-@ ch &apos;u &#91; 2651 0130 3255 &#93; , Wu Yu @-@ chang &#91; 0702 3768 4545 &#93; , Tung Pi @-@ wu &#91; 5516 1801 2976 &#93; , Hsieh Chueh @-@ tsai &#91; 6200 6030 0762 &#93; , and Tung Wei @-@ chien &#91; 5516 1919 0256 &#93; .
Many of our people , such as Chu Teh , Chou En @-@ lai , P &apos;eng Teh @-@ huai , Liu Po @-@ ch &apos;eng , Ho Lung , Lin Piao , Yeh Chien @-@ ying and Hsu Hsiang @-@ ch &apos;ien , were former leading cadres of the Kuomintang &apos;s revolutionary army .
The current task is to struggle for the actual realization of the revolutionary Three People &apos;s Principles .
This is to say that nationalism for an independent and liberated China must be realized through the war of resistance against the outsiders , in order to realize democratic freedom internally , establish a system of general elections for the national assembly , republic with the power to the people , and improvement of people &apos;s livelihood to alleviate the sufferings of the people under the principle of people &apos;s livelihood .
The Three People &apos;s Principles is not incompatible with our current political program , and we are asking the Kuomintang precisely for these things .
In our letter to the Kuomintang of last August we requested them to revive the three principles of Dr.
Sun Yat @-@ sen .
We are most resolute and most loyal in our struggle to bring about a China governed by the three principles .
The agrarian reform policy practiced in the past is but the proposal of Dr.
Sun Yat @-@ sen that those who farm shall have their land .
As to our continuing belief in communism there is no conflict there .
When Dr.
Sun Yat @-@ sen was still living he agreed
to our continuing belief in communism .
In recent times you can name it and you will find it in the Kuomintang .
There are many in the Kuomintang who believe in capitalism , and there are also quite a few believers in anarchism .
Some of them believe in Confucianism , Buddhism , .
the Methodist denominationa conglomeration of all sorts of beliefs .
It is necessary only for the current revolutionary political program to become unified and unanimous thereby forming a foundation of unity for national salvation , then all doubts will be dispelled and we shall take the path of facing the nationrs peril together .
The bright and prosperous future of China rests on this .

LETTER TO THE SPANISH PEOPLE 15 May 1937 &#91; Text &#93; To the armed comrades of the Spanish people !
We of the Chinese- Communist Party , the Chinese Red Army , and the Chinese Soviet hold the view that the war being fought under the leadership of the Spanish government is the most sacred one in the world .
This war is not only being fought for the very existence of the Spanish nation , it is also a war fought on behalf of the oppressed peoples of the world .
This is so because the Spanish people and its government are resisting the Italo @-@ German fascist imperialists and Spanish rebels who are destroying world civilization , culture , and human justice .
The Spanish government and its people are now fighting the Italo @-@ German fascist imperialists who are now going all out to support the fascist imperialists of Japan who are attacking China in the Orient .
The fascist imperialists of Japan are putting all their effort into China .
After forcefully occupying our Four Northeastern Provinces , they launched their aggression against north and central China .
Without the help of the Italo @-@ German fascist imperialists ^ the Japanese fascist imperialists would not be launching such frenzied offensives against China as they are doing today .
The Chinese Communist Party is in full concurrance with the unification of all parties and factions on the people &apos;s front .
Furthermore , we are also calling upon all parties and factions in China to unite and form a national unified front to oppose the Japanese fascist imperialists .
This work is being carried out with utmost urgency .
A victory for us will be a blow against the Japanese fascist imperialist , and this will also help the people of Spain and its government .
We believe that the struggle of the Chinese people cannot be separated from the struggle of the Spanish people .
Today , the Chinese Communist Party is using its struggle against the Japanese fascist imperialists to help and encourage the Spanish people .
The Chinese Communist Party , the Chinese Red Army , the Chinese Soviet , and the Chinese people are deeply moved by your victories on the northern and southern fronts and in protecting Madrid .
The
newspapers in our Soviet areas daily publish news concerning your heroic and courageous struggle .
We are firmly convinced that the unification of all parties in your people &apos;s front is the foundation for your final victory .
We unreservedly concur with the 10 major guidelines set forth by the Spanish Communist Party .
Besides pointing out the similarity between your struggle and the struggle we are engaged in .the , East , we would like to mention that Trotskyite bandit elements have infiltrated our ranks .
Only by resolutely opposing these internal renegades can we consolidate our fronts , and by launching a struggle opposing our own enemies we are also helping you .
in your struggle in Spain .
In China there are over 100 different newspapers and periodicals that publish news , articles , and photos and they are sympathetic with your heroic struggle for democracy and freedom .
We know.that your victory will directly assist us in our struggle against the Japanese fascist imperialists .
The cause you are struggling for is our cause , too .
We read with , deep emotion about the International Brigade composed of people from various countries of the world , and we are very happy to learn that there are Chinese and Japanese participants .
Many comrades of the Chinese Red Army are willing to go to Spain and join you in your struggle , and not a day passes without their discussing your struggle and the situation in the entire country of Spain .
If there had not been the Japanese enemy to be dealt with , we would certainly have joined your ranks .
You all know that the Chinese Red Army has gone through 10 years of ceaseless warfare of the most difficult kind .
There were no resources , hunger and cold were constantly with us , and there was no supply of arms and ammunition .
But in the end we finally won our present victory .
We understand that you and your troops are going through the same difficulties we experienced , but we believe that you will be victorious .
Our 10 @-@ year struggle has taught us that if a revolutionary people and army oppose an enemy unwaveringly and without fear of difficulties , they will be certainly victorious .
We , the Chinese Communist Party , the Chinese Red Army , the Chinese Soviet , and the Chinese people , extend our deepest comradely respect to the heroic men and women of Spain who are fighting for their democratic system .
Through them is expressed the spirit of unlimited unity and friendship of the oppressed nations of the world .
As we had done before , we shall continue to keep our attention focused every hour , every day on the course of your struggle , and we shall be happy and joyous with all the victories you win , and we believe that final victory will definitely be yours .

ON ANTI @-@ JAPANESE DEMOCRACY AND NORTH CHINA YOUTH 1937
&#91; Text &#93; Question : How are the recent peace negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party going ?
Answer : The talks are still in progress .
The common political program for the two parties is of primary importance since it is the basis for their cooperation .
If there is no such program cooperation will not be complete , and the principles underscoring the program are the revolutionary tasks of nationalism , democracy , and people &apos;s livelihood .
On the reorganization of the military and the transformation of the Soviets , these concrete tasks will be carried out soon .
So far , what the Kuomintang has expressed is still not enough , for example the charges brought by the leaders of the save the nation party of Shanghai .
The various limitations set upon the rules and regulations governing the national congress and the treatment of Shanghai textile plant workers were quite disappointing .
Question : Has the danger of civil war been completely eliminated ?
Answer : On the surface it appears that the danger of civil war has passed , however it still exists although it is not significant now .
If peace is said to be wholly successful it will lead the people to slacken their efforts in the movement to &quot; consolidate peace . &quot; Cessation of civil war on a nationwide scale still has not been achieved today .
The Communist Party on their part has issued orders to Red troops dispersed all over the country to stop fighting , but the Kuomintang troops are still carrying on with their annihilation offensives .
Fighting is still going on along the border areas of Fukien @-@ Chekiang @-@ Kiangsi , Hupeh @-@ Honan @-@ Anhwei , Hunan @-@ Kiangsi , and the Hunan @-@ Hupeh @-@ Kiangsi provinces , and we are requesting the Kuomintang to stop their offensives against these areas .
The opposition of Nanking and the local areas also exist .
Only through exercising absolute democracy can these dangers of opposition and civil war be completely averted .
Question : What are the views of the Communist Party with regard to the various factions in Nanking ?
Answer : We are willing to join with all those Kuomintang elements who are sympathetic with the national democratic revolution , as for those who are not we shall carry out the work of explanation to make them understand and not to interfere with the national democratic revolution .
The Kuomintang left wing &apos;s approval for peace and the movement for democratic war of resistance is still developing , and they hope to see the entire country united , the Three People &apos;s Principles of Dr.
Sun.Yat @-@ sen revived , and the Kuomintang reformed in order to revive its revolutionary spirit .
A certain section of people are not resolute enough , they do not unreservedly accept the tasks of national democratic revolution and entertain doubts about cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party .
They are struggling against the impact and the pull of the people &apos;s tasks which are pushing them to the side of the people .
Another body of people , the so @-@ called pro @-@ Japan faction , also exist within the Kuomintang .
The entire country , as well as the majority in the Kuomintang , are very much dissatisfied with them .
If they do not change their attitudes they will be destructive to the people and to the Kuomintang .
Question : What kind of development was attained with regard to the United Front after the Sian Incident ?
Answer : There was development in the United Front Movement after the Sian Incident , significantly the contact between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party .
There were also modifications in the attitude of suspicion toward the policy of the Communist Party .
They did not oppose the cooperation of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party , and there was also a diminishing in the views held by the &quot; leftists &quot; opposing the peaceful solution of the Sian Incident .
However , distrust of the Nanking government still exists in literary circles , the student bodies , and the media , because Nanking , so far , has given no concrete expression of its willingness to thoroughly and resolutely change over .
Many erroneous things were still held on to by the government , thereby leading to distrust throughout the nation .
We say &quot; everybody should work , &quot; but the complete changeover of the Nanking government must wait for the people to continue with their work and this is not necessary .
There is hope for a United Front in the future .
There must be unity within the country before we can attain the objectives of the war of resistance .
This is quite obvious .
Question : What is the reaction of the various parties and factions within the country toward the United Front idea ?
Answer : With the exception of traitors , all other parties and factions are in sympathy with the idea of nation @-@ wide unity .
Many of the bourgeois class have welcomed and agreed with the policy of peace obtained by the Communist Party during the Sian Incident .
However , some of the obdurate personages adopted an attitude of opposition .
If these elements do not change their attitudes they will be in actuality helping Japanese imperialism regardless of what their subjective viewpoints are .
In accordance with what we have learned , it is precisely those traitorous elements who are directly under the command of the Japanese who are the fiercest opponents of unity within
the country .
For instance , the likes of the Trotskyite elements are quite obvious examples .
The activities of these elements are , beyond the shadow of a doubt , the activities of traitors .
In dealing with this portion of people will use all available means to expose their plots so that they will not be able to deceive the masses and have the people of all China recognize them as the public enemy of the nation so that they will rise en masse and attack them .
Question : How will the problem of opposition between Nanking and the factions holding local powers be resolved ?
Answer : The existence of this opposition between Nanking and the factions holding local power will be a disadvantage in dealings with foreign matters .
It is our policy to diminish such oppositions as much as possible in order to attain the objective of uniting against the foreigners .
In order to achieve such an objective the Nanking government and the various provinces should all take a step toward rapproachment .
Foremost , there must be progress on the question of democracy , only thence can opposition be eliminated and we all step onto the great road of united opposition against the Japanese .
Question : How can a suitable solution be worked out on the question of class struggle in the policy of the United Front ?
Answer : It will be impossible to eliminate class contradictions before the class system is done away with .
Faced with the war against Japan , we must , however , seek a suitable solution for this problem .
Therefore , in the program of the United Front , we proposed giving the people democratic rights in the political field , and improvement in livelihood in the economic field .
It is inevitable that workers and peasants will rise in opposition when they are oppressed politically and economically , and this contradiction can be alleviated only by giving them democratic rights and improving their livelihood .
We will set forth in the mutual political program now in the process of being negotiated with the Kuomintang that the workers will have the freedom of assembly , association , and speech and universal , suffrage .
Improvements must be made in the treatment of workers and in their working conditions .
As for the peasants , there should be cuts in rents and taxes .
With regard to the land problem it should be settled through legislation and other suitable methods .
Question ; Why are you now stressing the question of democracy ?
Answer : At other times I have talked a lot about the relationship between democracy and opposition against Japan .
In order to secure peace and unity in the country , peace will not be consolidated and there will be no true unity if there is no democracy .
It requires the participation of the people of the whole country to fight Japan and if there is no democracy the civilians cannot participate , and there will be no peace and unity .
The war of resistance will become impossible without the participation of the people , and even if the fight is carried on victory cannot be guaranteed , therefore , the democratic system is a necessary condition , for victory in the war of resistance against Japan and it is absolutely indispensable .
Therefore , it is to be victorious against Japanese that we stressed the question of democracy .
Question : How are you going to promote the realization of political democracy ?
t
Answer : The realization of political democracy is dependent upon the democratic movement .
Political democracy will not be realized without the broad masses of people demanding for and giving impetus to the democratic movement ; All parties and factions and various circles throughout the country should unite and struggle to win democratic rights .
The military throughout the country should support this democratic movement .
We can achieve victory over Japan and save China and avoid the danger of becoming a colony only by realizing political democracy and giving.the people the freedom to take part in politics .
In practical implementation of the democratic movement we must give our attention to the election , convention , and holding of the national congress .
We should pay attention to winning complete freedom of speech , assembly , and association , as well as patriotism and saving the nation .
These are the very minimum of democratic rights and if the entire nation turns in this direction it will be possible to realize a unified democratic republic .
Question : What is the attitude of the Communist Party toward the current national congress ?
Answer : The current national congress is of national defense in nature , and , at the same time , it forms a bridge to cross from dictatorship to democracy .
Therefore , the entire country should participate and the Communist Party intends to take part .
With regard to the election , convention , and tasks of the national congress , the Nanking government has not been democratic about it .
If they do not make any revisions then the congress will have very little effect , therefore , the entire country should join in requesting the Nanking government to revise those illegal regulations .
The election of the national congress should have the participation of the people .
Ample freedom should be permitted for convening and opening this congress and its task should not be limited to the discussion of the Constitution but must be expanded to discuss thoroughly and concretely the policy of fighting the Japanese to either save the country or lose it .
The opinions of the Communist Party regarding the national congress have already been proclaimed to the country .
They have also been proposed to the Kuomlntang and talks are now being held .
The objective is to have the congress accomplish the task of democratic opposition against Japan .
Question : What are the views of the Communist Party on the question of freeing political prisoners ?
Answer : Long ago , the Communist Party requested the release of political prisoners throughout the country .
This request is still being made and it is incorporated into the talks held with the Kuomintang .
If the Nanking government desires to express a thorough transformation of its policy there is no reason why the political prisoners should not be freed .
However , there has been no concrete expression from the Kuomintang presently on this question .
Although they have verbally agreed to free political prisoners nothing of this sort has actually taken place .
Besides , incidents of continuing arrests of patriotic prisoners have occurred .
The trial of the leader.of the Save the
Nation party in Suchow was a great disappointment for the people , and there were also many within the Nanking government who were dissatisfied .
If the Nanking government sincerely desires to express its determination to make a new beginning with , the people it should immediately release the seven leaders of national salvation and proclaimed thetn to be innocent .
Question : What suggestions do you have with regard to the question of preparing for the war of resistance ?
Answer : We must- immediately put up resistance regardless of when the Japanese imperialists launch its offensive against us .
We are prepared to deal with incidents at any moment without regard to when or where the war erupts .
But if Japan does not launch a massive armed attack against China for the moment and adopted a relatively mild policy during the period of preparation for aggression , we should then utilize this moment to take positive action in the work of preparing for the war of resistance .
The &quot; preparations &quot; we have set forth has a different context from the principle of preparation propounded by the Kuomintang in the past .
The Kuomlntang &apos;s preparation theory is to pacify domestically first and then drive out the foreign enemy .
It vas a civil war with no defined boundaries , and an attrition on the forces to resist Japan .
Today &apos;s preparations in the making are for stopping the civil war , consolidate domestic peace , realize political democracy , open the doors to all freedomes of the people to save the nation , organize the masses , train and arm them , and , at the same time , to accelerate the accomplishment of the preparation work for resisting the enemy in such areas as the military , political , finance , economy , culture and education .
The war of resistance in China seeks final victory .
The sphere of this victory is not limited to Shanhaikuan nor is it restricted to northeast China .
It encompasses the liberation of Korea and Taiwan , and even the success of the people &apos;s liberation revolution in Japan .
This is our proposal for the preparations for the war of resistance .
Question : What is your estimation of the conclusion of the Sino @-@ Japanese war ?
Answer : There are two possibilities for the conclusion of the war .
First , China is completely victorious over Japanese imperialism , the Chinese nation gaining freedom and liberation , the success of the United Front within the country , a close unity between the government and the people , victory for the international peace front , support of the peace forces within the Japanese nation , striving to attain the conditions that will bring about such a future .
But the most important and decisive condition for winning such a future is the self @-@ unity of the Chinese people and a determined war of resistance .
Without this condition the war of resistance is hopeless .
Second , Japanese imperialism achieves its objective of transforming China into a colony solely its own .
This danger also exists .
This will happen only under such conditions as when the Chinese people are scattered and not united , offering no resistance or fighting a war of resistance irresolutely and haphazardly , and not uniting with their friends who are helping them .
If the Chinese people continue to sleep , the enemy will take away their house .
The Communist Party is struggling for the first one .
Setting forth the proposal of a National United Front is to achieve this first future .
We call on all parties ,
factions , and classes to resolutely oppose the attempt to make China a colony and demand the freedom and liberty of China .
We must struggle to the end with the enemy in order to achieve victory in realizing such freedom and liberty .
Question : What are your views on the recent closeness between Britain and Japan ?
Answer : The rulers of Japan and the conservative government of Britain between them are planning to ameliorate their conflicts by carrying out negotiations of compromise in order to achieve their objective of sacrificing China .
The Chinese people cannot allow them to carve up China as they please , and the Chinese people must give their closest attention to this matter .
Should the Wanking government manifest vacillation and apathy in the task of protecting national interests , the people and patriots within the Ruomintang must not show them any mercy .
At the same time we must realize that the compromise between the two countries of Britain and Japan has not yet formed a good base .
It is true that there will always be the possibility of compromise between Britain and Japan but there is a limitation as to where and when .
The British want to preserve the status quo , but its contents are easily mutable ..
This can be seen from the step @-@ by @-@ step retreat made by the British after 18 September .
Basically , the policy of Japan to solely occupy China and the open door policy held by Britain and other imperialists are in opposition to each other .
But temporary and partial compromises are possible because Britain can sell out the interests of China at any time in order to attain the objective which will be to its interest .
Regardless of the degree of compromise reached between Britain and Japan , the Chinese people should not for a single moment drop their guard regarding the life and death of China , and in the movement to resist Japan we must not place too much trust in Britain .
By understanding clearly the basic nature of the British we will not be taken in by them .
China cannot be completely isolationist .
Dr.
Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s policy of union with Russia has practical political significance today .
The relationship between China and Russia should advance a step closer and be improved upon .
The interests of the United States in the Par East is also incompatible wi.th the continental policy of Japan , therefore , the United States should not .
be an idle bystander with regard to the question of China and we should make a distinction between the British conservative party and the broad masses of the British people .
With regard to the British conservative party &apos;s policy on Western Europe , it vacillates between the peace front and the fascist front and it has already aroused great dissatisfaction among the country &apos;s people .
If they once again hobnob with the Japanese aggressors to seek a compromise , they will not only arouse the opposition of the Chinese people but it is doubtful whether they will have the sympathy of their own people .
The organizing of a world @-@ wide peace front Is proceeding in depth and breadth , and it Is also making preparations to stop all fascism .
The liberation movement of China is closely connected with the liberation movement of the world and our future is absolutely bright .
Question : What hopes do you hold for the youths of the North ?
Answer : The youths of the North are the vanguards In the struggle for national liberation .
The majority of them should unite and struggle to the end for national democratic revolution .
Many among them are troubled by the situation , and a solution should be sought in a collective movement , and this movement is a struggle to realize democracy and the war resistance against Japan .
The youths of the North should heighten their enthusiasm for achieving freedom of the peopleTs livelihood .
Striving to achieve the patriotic freedom of democracy forms one link in the core of the political life of today .
For instance , if some , people only talk about resisting Japan and do not understand the realities of the struggle for political democracy , then resistance against Japan will not be effective .
The reformism of the bourgeoisie is having an impact on the youths of the North .
Its attempt is to draw them from the front lines to the rear areas , from an environment of excitement to peace and quiet , and from positions of leadership to become followers , thereby extinguishing the leadership roles played by the youths of the North in the national democratic revolution , and the youths should struggle against such reformism and strictly examine the influence and trends of these reformists and completely overcome them .

LETTER TO BROWDER , SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE U.S.
COMMUNIST PARTY 24 June 1937
&#91; Text &#93; Dear Comrade Browder :
Through the courtesy of a comrade &apos;s visit we are writing to you , our respected comrade Browder , a good friend of the Chinese people and a leader of the American people .
The Chinese Communist Party are similarly faced with a historical task .
This task is no other than to oppose and overthrow Japanese imperialism1s policy of aggression .
The Chinese Communist Party is endeavoring to bring about a National United Front of opposition against Japan .
Although our work is currently in the midst of a difficult period we have made progress , and we are also giving all our efforts to achieve the results we are working for .
We hear from American friends and other sources that the Communist Party of America and the masses of America are very much concerned about the Chinese struggle against Japan and are giving us help on many fronts .
This makes us feel that our struggle is absolutely not a solitary one .
From the heroic and courageous aid given us from abroad we feel that when victory becomes ours , it will be very useful to the struggle of liberation waged by the American people .
The world is on the eve of a big explosion .
The working class of the world and all people seeking liberation must unite and rise to engage in a common struggle .
In closing I give you my revolutionary salute !

1 TO &apos; RURAL INVESTIGATION &apos; 6 October 1937
&#91; Text &#93; Of all the materials I personally collected from the rural areas during the period from the Northern Expedition in 1927 to my departure from the Central Soviet Region in 1934 , only the following are left : ( 1 ) the Hsun @-@ wu Investigation ; ( 2 ) the Hsing @-@ kuo Investigation ; ( 3 ) the Investigation of Tung @-@ t &apos;ang and Other Places ; ( 4 ) the Mu @-@ k &apos;ou Tsun Investigation ; ( 5 ) the Land Distribution in Southwestern Kiangsi ; ( 6 ) the Problem of Land Rental with Unharvested Crops ; ( 7 ) the Mistakes in Land Struggle in Kiangsi ; ( 8 ) the Rich Peasant Problem After Land Distribution in Yung- ^ -hsin ; ( 9 ) the Two Initial Stage Land Laws ; ( 10 ) the Chang @-@ kang Hsiang Investigation ; and ( 11 ) the Ts &apos;ai @-@ ch &apos;i Hsiang Investigation .
The last two had been published in &quot; Struggle News &quot; in the Central Soviet Region .
The original manuscript of the other nine investigations , which survived the long march , are preserved .
All the other materials were lost .
The most regrettable loss is the Five Hsien ( Changsha , Hsiangtan , Hsianghsiang , Hengshan and Liling ) Investigation . , done in Hunan in the spring of 1927 .
It was lost because of the Hsu K &apos;o @-@ hsiang rebellion .
The Ningkang and Yunghsin investigations made in the spring of 1928 at the Chingkang mountains were lost because of the fall of the Chingkang mountains .
The materials preserved here were all from the Central Soviet Region .
The first nine parts reflected land distribution at its early stage .
The last two parts reflected land distribution as it was thoroughly implemented .
Incomplete as they are one can get a general idea from these materials .
This is a kind of historical material in which some of the viewpoints were my opinions at that time and which I have subsequently changed .

TALK WITH &apos; HSIW @-@ CHUNG @-@ HUA , PAO * REPORTER IN YENAN ( ON ONE @-@ PARTY DICTATORSHIP )
2 February 1938
&#91; Text &#93; Question 1 : Is the present political system in the Soviet Union a one @-@ party dictatorship ?
Answer : The Soviet Union is a country under the dictatorship of the proletariat , that is , a worker @-@ peasant socialist dictatorship state and not a state under a party dictatorship .
From the Marxist @-@ Leninist viewpoint , class dictatorship and party dictatorship are two different things .
Party is only an organization of the most awakened people in a class .
A party should and can only play a leading role in a country under a proletarian dictatorship .
A party should not and cannot take the place of a class to effect a dictatorship .
Therefore , Lenin and Stalin , founders of the political system of the Soviet Union , never mixed party dictatorship and class dictatorship as one problem .
Instead , when occasionally borrowing the so @-@ called term of &quot; dictatorship , &quot; they referred only to the leadership function of the party in the country &apos;s political system .
In order to enable you to understand and believe my interpretation , I am glad to introduce to you what Lenin and Stalin said about this problem .
For the sake of recollection and understanding , I wish to introduce to you especially Lenin &apos;s opinion cited in Stalin &apos;s book &quot; Concerning the Problem of Leninism &quot; and Stalin &apos;s own opinion on this problem .
In the section on &quot; Party and Worker Class in Proletarian Dictatorship System &quot; in this book , Stalin made detailed and clear expositions on Lenin &apos;s opinion on this problem .
For instance , he said :
&quot; For example , here in our Soviet Union , in a country under proletarian dictatorship , this fact should be regarded as the highest manifestation of the leadership role of the party .
This fact is that our Soviet or other mass organization , in resolving any important political or organizational problem , must base its decision on the direction of the party .
In this sense , it may be said : proletarian dictatorship , in fact , is the &apos; dictatorship &apos; of the vanguard of the proletariat , or the &apos; dictatorship &apos; of the party of the proletariat because the party is the basic
leadership force of the proletarian class . &quot; Please see Lenin &apos;s talk about this problem at the Second World Congress of the Comintern :
&quot; ( Tienaire ) said : He advocates proletarian dictatorship , but his understanding of proletarian dictatorship is not entirely the same as our understanding of it .
He thinks that the proletarian dictatorship as we understand it is in substance the dictatorship of a minority of the proletarian class who are well organized and awakened .
It is true that during the capitalist era when the proletarian class was subjected to incessant exploitation and unable to develop their ability as human beings , the greatest characteristics of the workers political party is that this political party can include only a minority of its own class .
The political party can only unite with a minority of its own class , just like the fact that in any capitalist society the really awakened workers constitute only a minority of all the workers .
Hence , we cannot but admit that only this awakened minority can guide and lead the broad masses of workers .
If Comrade Tienaire says that he is the enemy of the political party and at the same time advocates letting a minority of the best organized and most revolutionary elements give direction to the entire proletarian class , then I would say that there is actually no difference in opinion between us . &quot; ( See &quot; Complete Works of Lenin , &quot; Vol 25 , p 347 )
However , is this to say that we can put an equal sign between proletarian dictatorship and the role of party leadership ( or party &quot; dictatorship &quot; ) ?
Is this to say that we can regard the former and the latter as one thing ?
May we substitute the former for the latter ?
Of course not .
Of course , we should not say so .
For example , Comrade ( Sulin ) had said that &quot; proletarian dictatorship is our party &apos;s dictatorship . &quot; ( Please see &quot; Lenin &apos;s Theories on Party , &quot; p 95 ) This way of saying evidently regards &quot; party dictatorship &quot; and proletarian dictatorship as one thing .
From the standpoint of Leninism , may we accept as correct this matter of regarding these two things as one thing ?
No , we cannot .
Prom this we can see that what is carried out in the Soviet Union is proletarian dictatorship , not the Communist Party dictatorship .
To confuse class dictatorship with party dictatorship is neither in agreement with Marxist @-@ Leninist theory , nor with the facts in the Soviet Union .
I think , as far as the Soviet aspect of this problem is concerned , the opinion of the founders of the Soviet political system , Lenin and Stalin , is the most authoritative and most creditable .
Question 2 : Although the Soviet Union is not under party dictatorship , why is there only one communist party in existence in the Soviet Union ?
Answer : In one respect9 this is the result of the choice of people1s will during the long struggle among the various parties and factions in Russia .
That is , the result of the fact that the Russians , in their long historical struggle , had become tired of and rejected other parties and only supported the Communist Party .
In another respect , due to the fact
that in the socialist Soviet Union , there is no social base for the existence of other political parties , and consequently there is no necessity or possibility for the existence of other political parties .
In order to make you understand and believe my way of interpretation , perhaps the best thing to do is to introduce to you what Stalin himself said on this problem .
The fact that the Soviet Union has only one Communist Party in existence is not a result of the workers1 manipulation or imagination , or the use of administrative order .
It is , rather , a result formed by historical life .
Concerning this point , Stalin said clearly in his talk with the First American Workers Delegation on 9 September 1927 .
He said :
&quot; The position of our Communist Party , the position of being the only public political party throughout the country ( the position of one @-@ party monopoly ) is neither created at will , nor out of empty imagination .
This kind of position can never be deliberately created by the use of administrative order .
The monopoly of our Communist Party grows spontaneously from actual life , and was gradually formed in history .
It is the result of the total bankruptcy and the subsequent fall of the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the Menshevik Party . &quot;
In the Soviet Union , there is no social foundation for the existence of other political parties besides the Communist Party , and there is no necessity and possibility for the existence of other political parties .
Concerning this point , Stalin made a special explanation in his report on the new constitution of the Soviet Union on 25 November 1936 .
He said :
&quot; At last , there is another group of critics .
If the above @-@ mentioned group of critics blame the draft constitution of the Soviet Union for abandoning the workers class dictatorship , then this group of critics is just the opposite .
They blame the draft constitution of the Soviet Union , saying that it has not changed the present situation in the Soviet Union at all .
They say it has not given up dictatorship of the working class , and it does not tolerate the freedom of various political parties , and it still maintains the validity of the present leadership position of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union as before .
At the same time , this group of critics regards the lack of freedom for various political parties in the Soviet Union as a sign of violation of the principle of democracy . &quot;
&quot; I admit that the draft of the new constitution of the Soviet Union still retains the validity of the dictatorship of the working class as before , and preserves the present leadership position of the Communist Party without any change .
If respectable critics regard this as a weakness of the draft constitution of the Soviet Union , then we can only express our regret .
We Bolsheviks regard this as a merit of the draft constitution of the Soviet Union . &quot;
&quot; As to the freedom of various political parties , then , our viewpoint in regard to this problem is slightly different .
A political party is part of a social class , and the vanguard of that class .
Only in societies where there are antagonistic classes whose interests are mutually antagonistic and irreconcilable with each other , in other words , only in a society where there are capitalists vs.
workers , landlords vs.
peasants , rich farmers vs.
poor farmers , etc .
can we talk about the existence of several political parties and the freedom of their existence .
In the Soviet Union , capitalists , landlords , and rich farmers disappeared a long time ago .
Today , the Soviet Union has only two classes of people , workers and farmers .
The interests of these two classes are not only not antagonistic , but , on the contrary , are harmonious .
Therefore , in the Soviet Union , there is no basis for the existence of several political parties , and consequently there is no basis for their freedom .
In the Soviet Union , there is a basis for only one political partythe Communist Party .
In the Soviet Union , only one partythe Communist Party which bravely and thoroughly safeguards the worker @-@ peasant interestcan survive .
The Communist Party has done a good job in protecting the interests of these two classes .
About this point , few can doubt . &quot;
&quot; Everyone is talking about democracy , but what is democracy ?
In capitalist countries , there are antagonistic classes .
Democracy there , in the last analysis , is democracy for those who have power , and democracy for the minority who have property .
Democracy in the Soviet Union , conversely , is democracy for the laborers , and democracy for all the people .
From this we can see that what violates the principle of democracy is not the new constitution of the Soviet Union , but the constitution of the capitalist class .
Therefore , I think the constitution of the Soviet Union is the only thoroughly democratic constitution in the world . &quot;
From this we can see that the existence of one party can only be achieved in a country with a social foundation like that of the Soviet Union where other parties have been totally rejected and overthrown by the masses of people during the course of revolution and where there is no other party in existence .
Question 3 : How can Germany and Italy carry out one @-@ party dictatorships ?
Answer : First of all , we must make a clear distinction between one party in power in a country , and the real existence of one party in a country .
It is true that in Germany and Italy there is only one party in power , but this is not to say that the political party in power is the only party in existence in these two countries .
In Germany , the fascist National Socialist Party is the only party in power today , but all the other political parties before the fascist party came to powerthe Social Democratic Party which had the support of hundreds of thousands of German voters during the last election ( 1933 ) , the Communist Party which had 5 @-@ 6 million voters , and other historical and traditional capitalist class parties in support of a democratic system with several
million voters @-@ are still in existence and active , although their existence and activities are covert and illegal .
Anyone who goes to German cities and rural villages to make a careful investigation will immediately see that although hundreds of thousands of anti @-@ government party elements are confined in concentration camps , the Social Democratic Party , the Communist Party and other parties in support of democracy and against fascist dictatorships are still struggling secretly and bravely .
They secretly publish papers and magazines .
They are engaged in educating and organizing the masses of people under difficult conditions .
The German political exiles in France , Czechoslovakia and Belgium are contacting political parties in Germany for establishing an anti @-@ fascist , democratic people &apos;s front .
In the leadership organizations of Social Democratic Internationale ( or the Second International ) and Comintern are seated delegates from the German Social Democratic Party and the German Communist Party .
The situation in Italy is not any different from that in Germany .
Similarly , the Italian Communist Party , Social Democratic Party and all other democratic parties are courageously and secretly conducting their anti @-@ fascist activities .
In the same manner , the delegates of these parties are establishing an anti @-@ fascist popular front inside and outside of Italy .
Delegates of the Italian Communist Party and Social Democratic Party also occupy important positions in the leadership organizations of the Third International and the Second International .
From this we can see , it is right if we say that in Germany and Italy there is only one party in power , and there is only one party which has legal status .
It is totally unrealistic to say that there is only a fascist party in existence in these two countries .
Question 4 : Some people say : Now Kuomintang should carry out &quot; one @-@ party dictatorship . &quot; What is your opinion on this problem ?
Answer : First , if what you call &quot; one @-@ party dictatorship &quot; refers to the control of national government by the Kuomintang alone , then this is a fait accompli today because , as everybody knows , all responsible persons in the national government are Kuomintang members , or persons whom the Kuomintang chooses to appoint of its own will .
Up to now there is nobody representing other Chinese parties in the government .
Our Chinese Communist Party is China &apos;s biggest political party outside the Kuomintang .
Today we do not ask for participation in the government .
This point has been frankly and earnestly announced on behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party by our party leader Comrade Ch &apos;en Shao @-@ yu &#91; 7115 4801 4416 &#93; in his interview with American correspondent Pal Te @-@ en on 25 December 1937 , and by another leader of our party , Comrade Chang Wen @-@ t &apos;ien &#91; 1728 5113 1131 &#93; &#91; or Lo Fu 3157 3940 &#93; in his article &quot; Consolidate Kuomintang @-@ Communist Cooperation To Strive for the Victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan11 published in &quot; Chieh @-@ fang , &quot; No 28 .
On this point I wish to represent the Chinese Communist Party to make a serious announcement again : We of the Chinese Communist Party now
earnestly help the Kuomintang fight the Japanese , but we do not ask for participation in the national government at this time .
Second , the so @-@ called one @-@ party dictatorship , whereby one party controls the country &apos;s political power , does not necessarily have to adopt the method of &quot; dictatorship . &quot; If the so @-@ called &quot; one @-@ party dictatorship &quot; method is actually equal to the policy carried out by the Kuomintang in the last decade , then I think it calls for consideration .
In my opinion , although the Kuomintang is able to maintain its one @-@ party control of political power , for the sake of concentrating all the talents to resist Japan and save the country and expressing the people &apos;s will of resisting Japan and saving the country , it seems that the Kuomintang should use considerably democratic measures .
Of course , these democratic measures are measures absolutely beneficial to the war of resistance , and measures which will absolutely consolidate the government and further enhance people &apos;s support of and confidence in the government .
Question 5 : Now there are people who say that the Kuomintang should carry out its &quot; no party outside the party &quot; policy .
In other words , a policy which does not allow the legitimate existence of any political party except the Kuomintang .
Sir , what is your opinion on this problem ?
Answer : To allow only one party , the Kuomintang , legitimate existence means not only nonrecognition of the lawful existence of the Communist Party and other political parties ( the National Youth Party , National Socialist Party , etc . ) j but is also an attempt to eliminate other political parties by armed force .
This is not only not a new theory , but an old fact which has been carried out for 10 years .
However , the miserable result of this fact is not only ceaseless internal strife , but also an invitation to unprecedented foreign aggression .
The painful experience of China &apos;s actual political life in the last decade tells us : The Kuomintang &apos;s policy of attempting to eliminate other political parties by armed force has failed ; meanwhile , the Chinese communist attempt to create a one @-@ party leadership regime under China &apos;s existing conditions has not reaped the anticipated results .
The experience of the first Kuomintang ^ Communist Party cooperation which resulted in the victory of the Northern Expedition and the serious national crisis caused by the Kuomintang @-@ Communist Party split in the last 10 years has taught comrades of both parties and all the people of China a bitter truth ; that is , the real effective way for creating a united China is not continued internal strife with one party opposing or attempting to eliminate another party , but pooling the strength of all parties on a common political basis to form a national united front ; first of all , close cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party .
The basic reason why China has been able to carry on the war of resistance against Japan in the last 6 months is the consolidation and unification of all national forces within the country .
The specific formula and specific content is the formation of the national united front against Japan by various parties with the Kuomintang @-@ Communist Party cooperation as the foundation .
That
is , the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have not only abandoned their mutual nonrecognition and mutually antagonistic stand , but carried out hand @-@ in @-@ hand cooperation in the interest of the anti @-@ Japanese and national salvation war .
That is , the Kuomintang has abandoned its former stand which denied the existence of the communist and other parties and carried out the policy of uniting with all other anti @-@ Japanese parties in the war against Japan .
The Communist Party and other anti @-@ Japanese parties also abandoned their former anti @-@ Kuomintang stand and cooperated with the Kuomintang in pursuing the common cause of resisting Japan and national salvation .
From this we can see that the forging of an anti @-@ Japanese national united front by all parties and factions is a necessary premise for China &apos;s war against Japan .
Lack of this premise or destruction of this premise will indeed put China in continued internal turmoil .
Once China is in internal turmoil , there will be no way to continue the war against Japan .
This is a truth easily seen and recognized by everybody .
It is precisely because of this that the Japanese militarists always attempt to apply , in addition to their military aggression , the poisonous plot of &quot; using Chinese to control Chinese . &quot; Their first attempt is to instigate another internal strife among the parties in China in order to destroy the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front .
From this we can see , the theory propounded by some people today for banning all political parties aside from the Kuomintang is in fact a theory which has been negated by historical facts of China , as well as an attempt to push China back to a tumultuous situation which existed before the national unification for the war of resistance against Japan .
At the same time , it will make the situation of a united China formed by the united front against Japan unable to continue , and subsequently creates again a situation in which China is powerless to resist Japan .
Therefore , no matter how loudly the proponents of this theory shout &quot; national unity , &quot; if unfortunately their theory is put into effect , the result would definitely be the destruction of the national unification already formed today .
No matter how loudly the proponents of this theory give lip service to &quot; resist Japan , &quot; if unfortunately their theory is put to practice , the result will definitely be the destruction of unification against Japan and we will be unable to continue the war against Japan .
It is precisely because of this that I firmly believe that such a theory in the name of national unification but actually detrimental to unification , such a theory in the name of fighting Japan but actually harmful to the war effort against Japan , and such a theory which will draw China back to the miserable situation which existed before unanimous unification against foreign aggression , will definitely be opposed by patriotic people , definitely be negated by the armed units throughout the country , and at the same time definitely be denounced and rejected by the wise leaders and comrades of the Kuomintang who are dedicated to the country and the people and who are willing to continue the war against Japan .
This is not strange at all because , first of all , this kind of theory is not in conformity with and runs against reality .
These people say : If there are nother parties which also have legal status , then the war effort against Japan will be hampered by party squabbles .
Facts have proved that when only one party , the
Kuomintang , was allowed to exist with legal status and other parties were not allowed to exist with legal status , China did have a very serious party squabble which had caused it to fail to resist Japan , or , at best , resist Japan in some places , and made China powerless to launch an all @-@ out war against Japan .
On the contrary , as soon as the Kuomintang allowed other political parties to have legal status and cooperated with other political parties , civil war stopped and party squabbles came to an end , and an unprecedented unification in both national administration and armed forces was achieved .
Consequently , China became able to conduct an unprecedented sacred war of national defense for safeguarding national existence and seeking national liberation .
These people say if other political parties are allowed legal status , then the legal existence of multiple parties will become an element hampering national unity or destroying national unity .
Facts in China have proven that when only the Kuomintang had legal status and other political parties were denied legal status , the country became tumultuous and incessant civil wars ensued .
Conversely , once other political parties were allowed legal status , national unity immediately emerged .
Even though there were quarrels among the parties on certain problems , they never used firearms as weapons for criticism ; at most they used mutual and friendly criticism as their weapon .
Facts in England , the United States , France , Belgium , Switzerland and other countries prove that the legal existence of multiple parties has never hampered or destroyed their national unity .
From this we can see , the theory that only when one party , the Kuomintang , is allowed to exist legally can China be unified and fight Japan is a theory incompatible with the actual life in China , and a theory which will make China neither really unified nor able to really resist Japan .
This kind of theory can never be accepted by China &apos;s soldiers and civilians who support national unification and resolutely resist Japan .
Question 6 : Now there are people who say } since the Communist Party has declared that it believes in the Three People &apos;s Principles then it can no longer believe in communism .
Sir , what is your opinion ?
Answer : First of all , I wish to say that since Communist Party members have declared that they will struggle for the realization of the Three People &apos;s Principles , some people say that this is tantamount to giving up their belief in communism .
I wish to make a serious statement once again on behalf of our party : This is a rumor spread by troublemakers , and is absolutely untrue .
We are Communist Party members .
We declared that we are willing to struggle together with Kuomintang comrades to accomplish the unfinished revolution of Dr Sun Yat @-@ senthat is , the goals of the Three People &apos;s Principles for China &apos;s equality in international status , political equality and economic equality .
At the same time , we will never give up our own communism which we have believed in for so many years and for which we have sacrificed and struggled for so many years .
Next , some people say , if you declare that you will struggle for the realization of the Three People &apos;s Principles , but at the same time you believe in communism , then this is in contradiction to the stand
of the Three People &apos;s Principles because it and communism are incompatible .
Concerning this point , I wish to point out seriously once again that this kind of saying is entirely wrong .
This kind of saying is neither in agreement with the theory and the action of Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen , the founder of the Three People &apos;s Principles and the revolutionary tutor of the Kuomintang , nor with the actual situation of China &apos;s revolution .
Theoretically , the substance of the Principle of Nationalism , Principle of Democracy and Principle of PeopleTs Livelihood under the Three People &apos;s Principles are tolerable with such thoughts advocated by communism as the complete overthrow of imperialist oppression in.order to enable the Chinese people to attain national independence , the complete destruction of feudalistic oppression in order to enable the Chinese people to have democracy .and liberty , and the complete transformation of China &apos;s economic system in order to enable the Chinese people to enjoy a happy livelihood .
Therefore , it is absolutely untrue that communism and the Three People &apos;s Principles cannot tolerate each other .
It is , therefore , not impossible that our party and Kuomintang can lawfully coexist and cooperate hand in hand .
Concerning this point , Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen had clearly indicated more than once in his talks on the Principle of People &apos;s Livelihood .
He said : &quot; Hence , as soon as we talk about social problems , the majority of the youth agrees with communism .
They want to carry out Marxism in China .
What , after all , is the intention of those young patriots who accept communism ?
Their intention is good .
Their ideal is to resolve the problem at its root , thinking that if we wish to set the basis of political and social problems right , the fundamentals of these problems must be resolved .
Therefore , they actively organize the Communist Party and conduct activities in China .
Now , our old comrades of the Kuomintang have a lot of misunderstanding about the Communist Party .
From what I said before , you may see that from Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s own writings on the theories of the Three People &apos;s Principles you can never
find any indication that the Three People &apos;s Principles and communism are repugnant to each other .
As to the indications of Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s actions on this problem , they are facts well known to everybody .
The Communist Party was founded in 1921 .
Since its founding , Dr Sun had close relationship with members of the Communist Party .
In 1924 when Dr Sun made up his mind to reorganize the Kuomintang , he openly cooperated with the Communist Party , The cooperation was very intimate .
It had not only established a Kuomintang @-@ Communist Party national revolution alliance , but also permitted Communist Party members to participate in Kuomintang organizations in their personal capacity to share the tasks of revolution .
At that time , the Communist Party had only about several thousand members in the entire country , the party was founded only a few years ago , and Communist Party members joined the Kuomintang in their personal capacity to struggle together for the cause of national revolution .
Under those circumstances did Dr Sun demand that those communist members should not believe in communism ?
No .
Or under those circumstances , did Dr Sun propose that only the Kuomintang was allowed to exist and the Communist Party was not allowed to exist at the same time ?
No .
He did not ; rather he resolutely opposed anyone making such a request or advocating this idea .
This is exactly why Dr Sun was great , farsighted and discerning because he deeply understood : the birth of any doctrine or any political party is not accidental ; it has its social foundation and historical background .
Nobody can be forced to believe anything , nor can anybody &apos;s belief be eliminated .
In history there were numerous people who died martyrs for their beliefs .
Any social foundation or organization supported by the masses can never be dispersed by force or eliminated .
In history numerous revolutionary organizations continued to exist arid develop under tremendous pressure and suppression .
Today &apos;s situation is quite different from before .
The Chinese Communist Party already has 17 years of revolutionary history .
It has hundreds of thousands of members , a strong organization which has long combat experience , a leadership cadre which is unswervingly and bravely struggling for their doctrine , their party , their revolution , the Chinese people &apos;s liberation , and the liberation of mankind , and the faith and support of millions of people .
How can we talk about eliminating the Communist Party members &apos; faith in communism and their party organization ?
If we say that we should renounce our belief in communism just because we have declared that we are willing to struggle for the thorough realization of the Three People &apos;s Principles , this is entirely a misunderstanding because our understanding of the relationship between the Three People &apos;s Principles and communism is exactly the same as that of Dr Sun Yat @-@ senthat is , we think that they are good friends and can tolerate each other .
Therefore , not only during the first Kuomintang @-@ Communist Party cooperation had our Communist Party members struggled together with comrades of the Kuomintang for the implementation of the Three People &apos;s Principles in their capacity as Communist Party members , but also during our lone bitter revolutionary struggle after our split with the Kuomintang our objectives remained to be China &apos;s national independence , democracy , liberty and happy livelihood ^ -objectives in conformity with the basic thinking of the Three People &apos;s
Principles .
The difference between today &apos;s situation and that during the Kuomintang @-@ Communist Party split is that during the split we Communist Party members struggled single @-@ handedly for our own communist ideal as well as the revolutionary ideal of the Three People &apos;s Principles .
How the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are cooperating with each other again , we Communist Party members are struggling together with our comrades of the Kuomintang again for our common revolutionary cause .
Therefore , under this condition , if there is any person who asks Communist Party members to give up their communist thinking and their organization , this is not only unacceptable to the Communist Party , but also in direct violation of Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s doctrines and actions , &#91; omission &#93; to promote the Three People &apos;s Principles is repugnant to communism . &quot; ( See &quot; Chung @-@ san Chuen @-@ chi , &quot; Vol 1 , &quot; Second Talk on the Principle of People &apos;s Livelihood , &quot; p 42 ) From this we can see that Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen publicly pointed out that it was a mistake for some of the comrades of the Kuomintang to think that the Three People &apos;s Principles and communism are not compatible .
Why has this mistake occurred ?
As Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen has particularly pointed out in his talk ( &quot; Chung @-@ shan Chuan @-@ chi , &quot; pp 44 and 45 ) , the reason is that these people don &apos;t understand the interrelationship among the Three People &apos;s Principles in general , and that people don &apos;t understand the Principle of People &apos;s Livelihood in particular .
Therefore , after giving the reason , Dr Sun continued in his talk : &quot; Why dare I say that our comrades of revolution did not understand the Principle of People &apos;s Livelihood ?
It is due to the fact that during the recent Kuomintang reorganization many comrades , because of their opposition to the Communist Party , went so far as to say that communism is different from the Three People &apos;s Principles , that it is good enough to carry out the Three People &apos;s Principles in China , and that communism cannot be accepted .
Then what , after all , is the Principle of People &apos;s Livelihood ?
In my last talk I raised a new question : What is the center of gravity of the development of civilization , the improvement of economic organization , and the progress of morality in society ?
The people &apos;s livelihood is the center of gravity .
People &apos;s livelihood is the motivating force of all activities in society because if the people &apos;s livelihood is not satisfied , civilization of society cannot be developed , economic organization cannot be improved , and morality will degenerate .
All injustices , such as class war , sufferings of the workers and various kinds of suppressions are attributable to the failure in resolving the problem of unsatisfied livelihood .
Therefore , all anomalies in society are the effects , while the problem of people &apos;s livelihood is the cause .
According to this reasoning , what is the Principle of People &apos;s Livelihood ?
The Principle of People &apos;s Livelihood is communism , or socialism .
Therefore , in regard to communism , not only that we cannot say it is in conflict with the Principle of People &apos;s Livelihood , but we should say it is a good friend .
Those who advocate the Principle of People &apos;s Livelihood should make a careful study . &quot; Continuing in his talk , Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen raised the question : &quot; Since communism is a good friend of the Principle of People &apos;s Livelihood , why do the Kuomintang members oppose communism ?
The reason is perhaps that members of the Communist Party themselves do
not know what communism is , and frequently make remarks opposing the Principle of People &apos;s Livelihood , thus causing hostile reaction from the Kuomintang .
However , we cannot blame the entire Communist Party or its doctrines for the behavior of these ignorant and mischievous party members .
We can only say that these are their personal conduct .
Therefore , we should never use the undesirable personal conduct of a few Communist Party members as the standard to oppose the Communist Party ; that is , we should not oppose communism as a doctrine on the basis of some personal conduct , Why should have this problem arisen among our comrades ?
The reason is that they don &apos;t understand what the Principle of People &apos;s Livelihood is .
They don &apos;t know that the Principle of People &apos;s Livelihood , after all , is communism . &quot; From this passage of Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s talk , what conclusion can we draw ?
Our conclusion should be : Pirst , the Three People &apos;s Principles and communism can tolerate each other and coexist .
The Three People &apos;s Principles has good relations with communism .
Second , those who think the Three People &apos;s Principles cannot tolerate communism actually are people who do not understand the Three People &apos;s Principles , especially the Principle of People &apos;s Livelihood .
These people should be only an extremely small minority in the Kuomintang .
Similarly those who think communism cannot tolerate the Three People &apos;s Principles are also actually people who do not understand communism , especially the relationship between communism and the Three People &apos;s Principles .
These people should also be only an extremely small minority in the Communist Party .
In regard to the solution of this problem , Dr Sun thought that this is only the personal conduct of certain members of both parties .
One party should not oppose the other party as a whole or its doctrines just because of such personal conducts .
Third , Dr Sun thought , not only should those who advocate communism understand the Three People &apos;s Principles , but also those who advocate the Three People &apos;s Principles should carefully study communism .
This is a brilliant , open , and unselfish attitude .
We Communist Party members extremely admire this attitude of Dr Sun &apos;s .
Indeed , any great thought or doctrine in the world is not the patented commodity of a certain group of people or a certain party .
It should and certainly will welcome anybody to study it and carry it out .
Not only that we are willing to struggle for the implementation of the Three People &apos;s Principles but also that we welcome anybodyfirst of all , comrades of the Kuomintang , to study communism carefully according to Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s guidance .
We are deeply convinced that all those who are willing to struggle for the liberation of mankind and really understand communism ( or Marxism ) must recognize that Marxism is the noblest ideal for resolving social problems and the best cumulation of human thinking over the last several thousand years .
Communist society is the most satisfactory , happiest and the most fortunate society ^ which should not be regarded as something to be afraid of .
It is precisely because of this that our country &apos;s greatest contemporary revolutionary Dr Sun said : &quot; Judging by the actual situation in China , the first Kuomintang @-@ Communist cooperation has led to the viable development of the revolution during 1925 @-@ 1927 , and the great victory of the Northern Expedition , while the split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has created an unprecedented serious situation
characterized by domestic turmoil and foreign aggression in the last 10 years . &quot; Now that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are cooperating with each other , externally we are able to wage an unprecedentedly glorious war of national defense ; internally we are able to achieve a political and military unification unprecedented in the last several decades and created a great unprecedented consolidation of all the forces of the parties and classes of the entire nation .
This has made all our fellow countrymen and the people all over the world feel that this is the only opportunity and hope for survival during this critical moment of life and death struggle for the Chinese nation .
Whether the legal coexistence of two doctrines and two parties is beneficial or harmful to the Chinese people and the nation should be adjudged by live and commonly known facts , not by biased or subjective wishes of a small number o people .
The past and present ironclad facts in China have proved once again that as soon as the Three People * s Principles and communism help and cooperate with each other , the country is unified and the revolution forges ahead ; as soon as the Three People &apos;s Principles and communism oppose each other and negate each other , the country is divided and the revolution runs into difficulty .
Therefore , any idea in violation of this fact cannot be carried out .
If unfortunately such an idea is carried out it will definitely create new disasters for the country and the nation .
From this we can see , the opinion that the Three People &apos;s Principles and communism cannot tolerate each other and , as a consequence , the Kuomintang and the Communist Party cannot lawfully coexist is an opinion without foundation and detrimental to the liberation of the country and the nation , This kind of opinion is not only in violation of the bequeathed theory and deeds of Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen , but also in contradiction to the actual situation in China .
The danger of this opinion lies in changing the good domestic situation characterized by unanimous opposition to foreign aggression into a possible situation where people &apos;s eyesight is turned inward , thus causing internal trouble .
Therefore , at the conclusion of this interview , I wish to repeat and seriously tell you a few words on this problem .
If the content of the so @-@ called Kuomintang one @-@ party dictatorship is Kuomintang control of the political power of the government , this is already fait accompli , and this is not a problem .
Although we Communist Party members do not participate in the government ourselves , we absolutely support the national government which is leading the country in the war against Japan .
Today , only the Japanese fascist militarists deny the authority of the national government and attempt to overthrow the national government .
Today only those Trotskyists and their disciples who execute the will of the secret service agencies of the Japanese aggressors spread the rumor that the national government is a Karensky @-@ type temporary and transit regime , and consequently adopt the traitor &apos;s policy of &quot; perfunctorily accommodating on the surface &quot; with the national government , but &quot; actually preparing to bring about its downfall . &quot; The support and help of the Communist Party members to the national government are absolutely sincere , started from
the fundamental stand of the basic interest of the country and the nation .
At the same time , if the content of Kuomintang one @-@ party dictatorship is enlarged to or misinterpreted as meaning that the communist and other political parties are not allowed to exist legally , or that the Communist Party members are not permitted to believe in their own communism , then this is absolutely not a new theory , but an old fact .
This is a return to the unworkable deadend road method of 10 years ago .
If this idea is put into effect , it will be harmful not only to national unification , but also to the war effort against Japan .
It will fragment the already formed national united front against Japan , and thus endanger the war of resistance and national salvation .
This thinking will definitely be utilized by Japanese fascist militarists and Chinese traitors .
It is precisely because of this that I can hardly believe this kind of thinking will have the sympathy of those knowledgable persons in the Kuomintang who take the basic interest of the country and the nation seriously , not to mention the sympathy of those unbiased nonpartisan soldiers and civilians who value national unification and dedicate themselves thoroughly to the war against Japan .
However , since this problem is publicly raised at this moment when the national crisis is increasingly acute , we cannot but seriously alert the Communist Party members , all political parties and fellow countrymen who are dedicated to the war effort against Japan and for national salvation .
This concerns not only the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party , but also all other parties and the fate of the entire Chinese nation .
Therefore , I hope my fellow countrymen from all walks of life throughout the country and the farsighted discerning gentlemen of all parties would pay serious attention to the tendency of development of this problem , make every effort to insure that China &apos;s anti ^ Japanese national united front based upon the cooperation o all parties will not be threatened and the national unification , the anti @-@ Japanese war , and the national salvation , movement will not be endangered so that we can carry on the war to the very end and win the final victory for our country and nation .
0 &quot; Talk With HSIN @-@ CHUWG @-@ HJA PAO Reporter in Yenan , &quot; 1939 * &quot; Liberation , &quot; 11 January 1938
TALK WITH REPORTER OF ASSOCIATED PRESS February 1938
&#91; Text &#93; Reporter : Now there are many people who are pessimistic about China &apos;s war against Japan .
What is your opinion , Sir ?
Answer : I am entirely optimistic about this because the course of China &apos;s war of resistance is inevitably one of defeat first and then victory , and one of initial weakness gradually turning strong .
This has become a definite direction .
In the early stage of the Sino @-@ Japanese war , the general situation was that Japan was strong and China weak .
But in the future Japan &apos;s weakness will be gradually exposed , and China &apos;s strength will be gradually built up , Japan is now borrowing money to wage the war .
Aside from the 2.2 billion yen spent in the last 6 months .
Japan is said to need 4 billion yen or more .
This has greatly depleted its national strength .
Japan &apos;s international credit has deteriorated , and the price of its bonds has dropped .
Its &quot; quick battle , quick ending &quot; plan has failed .
Let us ask how can it have so much money to prolong the war indefinitely ?
Militarily , Japan &apos;s battle front has been extended several thousand miles from Hangchow to Paotow .
It does not have enough men to be deployed just for defense .
Therefore , its military strength is gradually weakening in proportion to the extent of deep penetration and wide expansion .
It occupies long stretches of railways , and troops have to be sent to guard each railway station .
Japan has mobilized one @-@ third of its armed forces to invade China .
If it wants to occupy Hankow , Canton and other cities , it has to mobilize hundreds of thousands of additional troops .
At that time , its situation will become worse .
Japan &apos;s enemy is not China alone .
Additionally , because of its domestic , international and other major contradictions , Japan will definitely be on the road to total collapse .
Question : Did you say , Sir , that China &apos;s strength can be gradually enhanced ?
Answer : According to the war experience in the last 7 months , militarily if we can employ mobile warfare , position warfare and guerrilla warfare
and coordinate these three types of warfare , we can definitely put the enemy force in an extremely difficult position .
In my opinion , at present , aside from using 200,000 to 300,000 crack troops to form a few strong field armies to launch annihilating attacks on the enemy &apos;s advanced units in a mobile warfare , we should also have 80,000 to 90,000 troops , organized into 20 or 30 hardcore guerrilla regiments with 3,000 to 4,000 men in each regiment , led by resolute and dynamic commanders and with their political work strengthened , deployed in front of the enemy &apos;s battle line from Hangchow to Paotow .
These forces should fight their way to the rear of the enemy line through 20 @-@ 30 gaps along this long battle front .
If this strategy is properly applied , the guerrilla units can work together with the local masses and proliferate into numerous small guerrilla units which will definitely be able to establish numerous anti @-@ Japanese bases behind enemy lines , mobilize hundreds of thousands of the masses , and forcefully coordinate with the mobile field armies and thus throw the enemy into discomfiture .
As to position warfare , we should not regard it as our main strategy at present because we are technologically inadequate .
However , we must build a national defense industry , and manufacture heavy and advanced weapons ourselves .
At the same time , we should find ways to transport these weapons so that we can effectively conduct both defensive and offensive positional warfare .
This is very necessary .
Some people say that we only advocate guerrilla warfare .
That is nonsense .
We have always advocated the coordination of mobile , position and guerrilla warfares .
At present , we are using mobile warfare as the main tactic , and the other two as complementary tactics .
In the future , we should make position warfare effectively coordinated with mobile warfare .
Guerrilla warfare , as a way of battle , is always complementary .
However , guerrilla warfare in semi @-@ colonial national wars , especially in countries with vast territories , occupies an important place in strategy .
Politically , we already have domestic unity , and have the sympathy and support of the democratic countries all over the world .
However , our present achievements are still not enough , and should be further strengthened .
The strengthening of the aforementioned military and political positions is necessary .
Only if we continue to exert our effort , can we strengthen our military and political positions , and this forecasts brightness in the future .
Question : Is the 8th Route Army being surrounded by the Japanese on all sides and facing the danger of being routed or annihilated by the Japanese ?
Answer : The 8th Route Army is presently engaged In an enlarged guerrilla warfare in four areas .
The first area is a pocket bordered by the Peiping @-@ Hankow , Peiping @-@ Suiyuan , Chengting @-@ Taiyuan , and Tatung @-@ Puchow railways and the adjacent areas to the east and the north of this pocket .
This area has 12 million people who are resolutely against the Japanese , and working closely with the armed forces .
This is a large bulwark of the war of resistance .
The 8th Route Army has firmly established its foothold here .
Although the enemy is stepping up its attack on this area , it is impossible
for him to chase them out , not to mention annihilating them .
Several big branch units of the 8th Route Army advancing toward the east have now come close to Tientsin @-@ Pukow Railway .
The second area is in northwestern Shansi , south of the Peiping @-@ Suiyuan Railway , west of the northern section of the Tatung @-@ Puchow Railway , and east of the Yellow River .
The third area is in southeastern Shansi and southwestern Hopeh bordered by the Peiping @-@ Hankow , Chengting @-@ Taiyuan and Tatung @-@ Puchow railways .
The fourth area is in southwestern Shansi .
The 8th Route Array is intimately associated with the local people , ready to severely attack the enemy &apos;s communication line at any time .
They have scored many major and minor victories , and greatly bogged down the enemy &apos;s advance forces .
In view of these areas , what China has lost are only several railways and a few cities , and it has not lost anything else .
This fact illustrates to the entire nation that if we adopt this method everywhere in the country , the enemy can never annihilate China .
This is one of the solid foundations for launching an offensive in the future for recovering the lost territory .
Question : Sir , do you think this Kuomintang @-@ Communist Party cooperation is of permanent nature ?
Answer : I think so .
The 1928 split was against the wishes of the Communist Party , The Communist Party has never wanted to split with the Kuomintang .
In the last 10 years , both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and the people all over the country had lived through hardship experiences which should strengthen future unification .
The purpose of the present and future cooperation is to fight the Japanese together and to rehabilitate the country together .
Under this principle , as long as our friendly party has the same sincerity as we have and as long as we have the supervision of the people of the entire nation , this cooperation will definitely be long lasting .
Question ; True , the Communist Party in its declaration on the current situation has said that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will not only fight Japan together . , but also rebuild the country together after winning the war against Japan .
But , may I ask how can these two political parties which represent two different classes of people cooperate with each other in building a new country ?
Answer : China is in a semi @-@ colonial status .
Right now , it is in a critical moment facing the danger of being wiped out as a nation .
Even its semi @-@ colonial status is in danger .
Although party is different from class , they share this same status .
This has predetermined that the two parties can cooperate not only in resisting the Japanese aggression but also in rebuilding the country .
But this cooperation is cooperation under a definite platform , and cooperation based on a principle .
It must be genuine cooperation , not just for experience or appearance .
If this cooperation is divorced from a common platform or principle , it will of necessity degenerate into expediency or cooperation only in appearance .
This is not permissible by any political party which , stands by principle .
Cooperation based upon principle and a common platform is comparable to the righteous friendship between two persons .
Only this kind of righteous friendship can last long .
Question : What is this &quot; democratic republic &quot; advocated by the Communist Party ?
Answer : The democratic republic we advocate is a country which has a system whereby its representative bodies are organized by representatives selected by people who are unwilling to be slaves through unrestricted universal election .
This kind of country is a country based on the principle of people &apos;s rights .
By and large this has been advocated by Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen a long time ago .
The policy of rebuilding China should be formulated in this direction .
Question : Is the Communist Party satisfied with the present central government ?
Is it still necessary to convene an ad hoc national congress ?
Answer : We support the present central government because of its adherence to the policy of waging a war of resistance against Japan , and its action ia providing leadership in this war .
But we wish this government to substantiate and broaden its basis and make necessary reforms in its internal administration so as to be more beneficial to the war of resistance .
We have proposed to convene an ad hoc national congress .
This was also proposed by Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen .
In our opinion , it will be beneficial for consolidating the country and strengthening the forces for the war effort .
As to what method we should use more beneficial to the war effort , we have no predetermined opinion .
As long as it is really beneficial to the war of resistance , any method can be adopted .
Question : Does the Chinese Communist Party provide leadership to the anti @-@ Japanese activities of the Volunteer Army in Manchuria ?
Answer : The Chinese Communist Party indeed has a close relationship with the anti @-@ Japanese Volunteer Army in Manchuria .
For example , such famous Volunteer Army leaders as Yang Ching @-@ yu &#91; 2799 7231 1342 &#93; , Chao Shang @-@ chih &#91; 6392 1424 1807 &#93; , Li Hung @-@ kuang &#91; 2621 4767 0342 &#93; and others are all Communist Party members .
Their meritorious services in the hard struggle against Japan is well known to everybody , A national united front exists there also .
Aside from Communist Party members , there are also other parties , other different armed units and mass organizations of the people .
They have united under a common policy .
Question : Sir , what is your general thinking about the United States ?
Answer : The American Democratic Party &apos;s support of international peace , President Roosevelt &apos;s condemnation of fascism , the Scripps @-@ Howard
newspapers &apos; sympathy toward ChinaTs war against Japan , and especially the support of the broad masses of American people for China1s struggle against Japan @-@ all these are welcome and for which we are grateful .
But we hope that the United States will take a further step by uniting with other countries to give the brutal Japanese some real censure .
It is time for China , the United States and other anti @-@ aggression countries to take a further step in their unification against the enemy .
&#91; Associated Press correspondent Mr Wang Kung @-@ ta &#91; 3769 0361 6671 &#93; visited Yenan in February 1938 , and had a talk with Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung .

SPEECH AT RALLY IN COMMEMORATION OF THE 13TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF DR.
SUN YAT @-@ SEN AND OF FALLEN OFFICERS AND MEN ON BATTLE FRONT
13 March 1938
&#91; Text &#93; Today is the 13th anniversary of the death of Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen .
We are here holding such a solemn commemorative rally .
Meanwhile , the war against Japan has been going on for 8 months .
Many brave officers and men have made the ultimate sacrifice .
We are holding here such a grave commemorative rally .
All these are not at random or accidental .
They have their reason in the development of our nationTs history .
Where does the greatness of Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen lie ?
It lies in his Three People &apos;s Principles , his united front policy , and his hard struggle spirit .
When I met Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen in Kwangtung , the Kuomintang First National Congress was in session .
The new outline of the Three People &apos;s Principles written personally by Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen , that is , the famous &quot; Declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang , &quot; was adopted .
At that time , the united front policy based on Kuomintang @-@ Communist Party cooperation began to be put into effect .
This united front included domestically uniting with the Communist Party , the workers and the peasants , and externally uniting with those nations which treat us equally to share the common struggle .
The famous &quot; Three Great Policies &quot; were established at that time .
Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s outline of the Three People &apos;s Principles and his united front policy are the greatest contributions to the Chinese nation from a great revolutionary of a country in a semi @-@ colonial status .
Dr Sun &apos;s greatness also lies in his hard struggling , unyielding , unbending and unfailing revolutionary perseverance and revolutionary spirit .
Without this kind of perseverance , and without this kind of spirit , his doctrines and policies could never be carried out .
The first sentence of Dr Sun Yat @-@ senTs Testament , which we just recited a moment ago , said : &quot; I have declared myself to the national revolution for 40 years . &quot; During those 40 years , he experienced much hardship and complicated situations , but the more he was frustrated , the more vigorously he struggled .
Unyielding and unbending , he always came back with redoubled strength after each failure .
When many of his followers showed signs of despair or were even ready to surrender or
desert the cause , Dr Sun stood firm .
He insisted on his doctrines .
During his lifetime , he had never neglected to develop his Three People1s Principles .
Never was there a time when he disregarded his doctrines .
He always insisted on and developed his Three People &apos;s Principles .
The Declaration of the First National Congress indicated the development of the Three PeopleTs Principles .
So was his effort for the united front .
Dr Sun had not only insisted on but developed the united front from a policy for the overthrow of the Manchus by uniting with all revolutionary parties and underground societies to a policy for the overthrow of imperialism and feudalist influence by uniting with the Communist Party , the workers and the peasants .
All these , in combination with his fearless , unyielding , unbending , and undaunted revolutionary perseverance and his practical revolutionary spirit , portray Dr Sun as a model , great revolutionary .
Today we have another united front .
This united front is much more broadened than the last .
The enemy with which this united front is dealing is much more formidable .
The program this united front is to execute is basically the same as that stated in the Declaration of the First National Congress , although it has undergone some development in form and content .
In the future , there will definitely be further developments .
For attaining the goal of implementing the Three People &apos;s Principles , enlarging the united front and defeating our enemy , we must manifest our hard struggling , unswerving and uncompromising revolutionary spirit through revolutionary practice .
If we are to commemorate Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen not merely as a matter of perfunctory formality , we must pay attention to the following : First , struggle for the thorough Implementation of the Three People &apos;s Principles .
Second , struggle for the consolidation and enlargement of the anti @-@ Japanese national united front .
Third , manifest the hard struggling , unyielding , unbending and unfailing revolutionary spirit .
I think these are the most pertinent , most substantial and the greatest heritage left by Dr Sun .
All Kuomintang members , all Communist Party members and all patriotic countrymen should accept and develop this heritage !
To judge whether one is a loyal disciple of Dr Sun , we should see his attitude toward these three precious heritages .
Now let us talk about the commemoration of our fallen officers and men in the war against Japan .
Since the Lukou @-@ chiao incident , a great war unprecedented in the history of the Orient has lasted 8 months .
The enemy has thrown in all available forces .
Their purpose is to wipe out China .
Its strategy is to win a quick victory through a quick war .
How about us ?
We have also employed all our available forces to resist .
Our purpose is to defend our fatherland .
Our strategy is protracted warfare .
In the last 8 months , our land and air forces gave a heroic account of themselves , a great national unity is carried out throughout the country , several million troops and numerous people have joined the fireline , and several hundred thousand of them have heroically given their lives while executing their duties .
Among them , many were Kuomintang members , many were Communist Party members and many others were nonpartisan .
We sincerely mourn for those who are dead , and we shall remember them forever .
From Generals Meng ^ -ling &#91; 6787 1125 7881 &#93; ,
T &apos;ung Lin @-@ ko &#91; 0157 7792 7040 &#93; , Chao Teng @-@ yu &#91; 6392 6260 4416 &#93; , Jao Kuo @-@ hua &#91; 7437 0948 5478 &#93; , Liu Chia @-@ ch &apos;i &#91; 0491 1367 4388 &#93; , Chiang Yu @-@ chen &#91; 1203 3768 6297 &#93; , Ch &apos;en Chin @-@ hsiu &#91; 7115 6930 4423 &#93; , Li Kuei @-@ fan &#91; 2621 2710 0030 &#93; , Huang Mei @-@ hsing &#91; 7806 2734 5281 &#93; , Yao Tzu @-@ hsiang &#91; 1202 1311 7449 &#93; , and Pan Chan @-@ kuei &#91; 3382 0594 7608 &#93; to each warrior , all were noble and great models for the Chinese people .
The Chinese nation is not a flock of sheep .
Rather it is a great nation richly marked by a sense of self @-@ respect and human righteousness .
For national self @-@ respect , human righteousness and their right to live on their own land , the Chinese people will never permit the Japanese fascists to achieve their lawless purposes without paying a heavy price .
Our methods are war and sacrifice .
We use war against war .
We use a revolutionary war for righteousness against a barbarian war of aggression .
This spirit has been proven during the several thousand years of our national history .
Now , another great proof is given .
It was for this proof that General Ho Meng @-@ ling and several hundred thousand men have sacrificed their lives .
We are sure that the Japanese fascists will make further advances .
They will attack Sian , Chengchow , Wuhan , Nanchang , Poochow , Changsha and Canton .
They want to devour all of China .
But we wish to inform the fanatic enemy that his objective can never be attained .
The enemy should not think that he has achieved his purpose after occupying our territory .
He has not and will never achieve his purpose .
In the verdict of history the victory of the Japanese fascists can only be temporary , not permanent .
There are enough reasons to prove that the eventual victory belongs to our side .
When the war comes to an end , they can only occupy a part of our territory , it being impossible for them to occupy the whole country .
If they can fight a quick war for the cities , then they will have to fight a protracted war for the vast rural areas .
For example , they have occupied several main roads and several cities in Shansi , but the vast countryside , which is many times bigger than the occupied areas , still belongs to China .
We have to tell our fellow countrymen this reason .
The Japanese can only achieve a partial occupation of any province .
They do not have enough strength for deployment .
In addition , their barbarian policy has angered every Chinese .
China has a huge army and hundreds of millions of people .
It is carrying out an excellent national united front policy .
All these have predetermined which side is going to win the protracted war and the final victory .
In the future , if Japan occupies a larger part of China as a result of bloody battles , we can use the remaining smaller part as our base to continue the war and win victory .
But in the larger portion of China ( Japan can only occupy big cities , main roads , and some plains .
If we can organize and arm the majority of our people in the countryside and establish many anti @-@ Japanese bases , such as the bases we have established at Wu @-@ tai Shan , we will have the Japanese army surrounded .
Someday , after all important party , political and military tasks are improved on a nationwide basis , our outer @-@ perimeter force will be coordinated with our inner @-@ perimeter forces for a well concerted big offensive .
At that time our effort must also be coordinated with the support of the revolutionary forces of the world and the support of the people &apos;s revolutionary force in Japan .
Who can say that the final victory will not be ChinaTs ?
Who can say that General Ho Meng ^ ling &apos;s blood was shed in vain ?
Who can say that the Japanese robbers will not be driven out of China ?
Who says that Dr Sun Yatsen &apos;s three great idealsnational liberation , freedom of people &apos;s political rights , and happy livelihoodcannot be carried out in China ?
We want all Chinese people to have this kind of clear understanding and firm conviction .
We want them to understand that the best policy is to wage a protracted war .
Under the leadership of the central government and Generalissimo Chiang Kai @-@ shek , we must in this great war , with one heart , break the shackles or the threatening shackles for slaves .
At this rally , we wish to salute all the officers and men on the front because they are fighting heroically for the final victory .
We wish to salute all the family members of our soldiers who are engaged in this war against Japan , especially the family members of those who died martyrs in this war because these families have produced such soldiers who fought so valiantly for their country unafraid of sacrifice .
We wish also to salute all those devoted , self @-@ denying and public minded workers and leaders at all levels and in all walks of life engaged in the war against Japan in the rear because their work has directly or indirectly helped the war effort .
At this rally let us salute our national leader and commander in chief Generalissimo Chiang Kai @-@ shek because of his unyielding , unbending and unfailing leadership in waging and directing this great war against Japan .
Fellow countrymen at this rally !
Fellow countrymen all over the country !
Let us be united forever !
Down with Japanese imperialism !
Long live China &apos;s national liberation !

NOTICE OF THE REAR AREA OFFICE OF THE 8TH ROUTE ARMY OF THE SHENSI @-@ KANSU @-@ NINGHSIA BORDER AREA GOVERNMENT
15 May 1938
&#91; Text &#93; The public is hereby notified :
Since the Lukouchiao Incident , the entire country and nation &apos;s forces and patriotic fellow countrymen under the leadership of the central government and Generalissimo Chiang Kai @-@ shek , are dedicated resolutely to the war of resistance against Japan .
The officers and men on the battlefront are shedding their blood and sacrificing their lives .
All parties and factions are sincerely united .
People from all walks of life are making a concerted effort to save the country .
These are strong safeguards for a bright future for China as a nation and a victory against Japan .
All our countrymen should march ahead along these lines .
The soldiers and civilians in the Shensi @-@ Kansu @-@ Ninghsia border area are a constituent part of China .
They obey the leadership of the central government and exert their efforts to prevent their country from perishing .
Everything we have done has been open and upright .
We struggle hard without claiming any credit .
All the people in the country regard us highly in their conversations .
This office of the border area government cannot but encourage all people in the area to exert their effort in order to thoroughly carry out our mission .
Hot a single person is allowed to neglect his duty , and nothing should be done to jeopardize the task of national salvation .
Recent investigations reveal that there are some elements who , in disregard of the general situation , use different methods to compel the peasants to return the land and houses already distributed to them , or compel the debtors to repay their already abrogated debts , or compel the people to change the already established democratic system , or sabotage the already established military , economic , and cultural organizations , and other mass organizations .
They are even disguised spies who contact bandits to instigate rebellion in the armed units , survey the land and draw maps , secretly investigate local situations , and openly oppose the propaganda of the border area government .
These conducts are evidently in contradiction to the basic principle of unification , for fighting Japan and in violation of the public opinion of the
people in the border area .
They attempt to create internal trouble , instigate class struggle for destroying the united front , destroying people &apos;s interest and destroying the prestige of the border government , increase the difficulty for mobilization against Japan , and create skepticism in the mind of the people toward their supreme commander and the central government .
This is attributable to a few stubborn elements who , disregarding the interest of the country and the nation , willfully pursuing their whimsical wishes and even being utilized by the Japanese aggressors , misrepresent themselves as a means to camouflage their covert activities .
In the last few months , many reports were received from people in various hsien .
There are several such reports each day causing an unusually heavy work load .
In order to strengthen the war effort against Japan , consolidate the rear area , and protect the interest of the people , this office of the border government cannot but forbid the above @-@ described activities .
It is deemed appropriate to notify the public as follows :
( 1 ) In the territory under the jurisdiction of the border government , all land and houses distributed and all debts nullified at the beginning of domestic peace in the country should not be changed at will as this office of the border government must protect people &apos;s obtained interests .
( 2 ) All military , political , economic and cultural organizations already established and all such organizations established , improved or developed according to the principle of national united front against Japan at the beginning of domestic peace in China should be guarded against intrigues and sabotage as this office of the border government must protect their activities and promote their development .
( 3 ) Under the principle of resolutely carrying out the central government &apos;s platform for war of resistance and national reconstruction , this office of the border government is glad to promote any anti @-@ Japanese and national salvation activities , and welcomes people from all walks of life to give their bona fide assistance .
However , all those who entered and then stayed in the border area without the consent of this office or the border government or without any identifying documents issued by this office or the border government are forbidden to engage in any activities , no matter what activities they are , in order to prevent imposters , traitors and spies .
( 4 ) During this tense period of war against Japan , people are allowed to inform on and arrest , if there is concrete evidence , elements who attempt to sabotage , willfully create trouble , incite people , or covertly gather military information in the border area .
If the accusations are found true , severe punishments will be meted out without exception .
All the soldiers and civilians in the entire border area must observe and not violate the above four points .
Any who dare to instigate trouble are hereby warned that these words are followed by law enforcement .
Don &apos;t say that they are not forewarned .

Yenan 2 July 1938
&#91; Text &#93; Question No 1 : What are the significance and function of the Border Region in China currently ?
Please tell us .
We wish very much to clarify this point .
Answer : You must understand the nature of the Frontier before you can understand its significance and function in China .
What is the nature of the Border Region ?
In a word , it is a democratic anti @-@ Japanese base .
First , in regard to the people , they all have their own organizations .
The people of the Border Region , as long as they remain under the principle of resisting Japan , all have their freedoms of speech , publication , meeting , and forming associations .
Ee they organizations of workers , peasants , merchants , students , intellectuals , women , children , or free lances , all of them have such freedoms .
The Communist Party and the Border Region Government actively support and aid them , enabling them to develop more generally .
Here , only the traitors are restricted in their activities .
In regard to the traitors , no freedom is granted them .
Hext , the Border Region has become the region directly involved in the resistance war .
A part of the 8th Route Army is stationed here , and there are also local armed forces .
In regard to such troops , there is a democratic spirit in the relationships between the officers and soldiers and between the troops and the people , so that there is unity between the officers and soldiers and between the military and the civilian , resulting in an invincible force in the resist @-@ Japan war .
Thirdly , education in the Border Region is also anti @-@ Japanese and democratic .
You can see this spirit in the Anti @-@ Japanese Military and Political University and the Northern Shensi Public School .
Fourthly , this also holds true in the economic aspect .
The principle is to benefit the resistance war , and the operation is by the democratic spirit .
The fairly developed cooperative here and the agriculture of the peasants
who have obtained land , for instances , are all : based on such spirit , improving the people &apos;s life and benefiting the resist @-@ Japan cause .
Here , we have taxation , but no harsh levies and vexatious collections .
We implement a sort of unified progressive tax , compatible with the principle mentioned above .
Fifthly , which is the most important , all levels of the Border Region Government are elected by the people by means of voting .
Here , we have proved one point : The claim of some people that , &quot; among the intellectually backward workers and peasants , the election system cannot be introduced &quot; is incompatible with the facts .
The result of popular election here is not bad , which anyone with eyes can see .
When the people elect those they like to handle the affairs of the government , the result is very good .
It is much better than the system of appointing government officials .
It is especially positive and effective in mobilizing the people &apos;s strength to participate in the resist @-@ Japan w.ar.
What is different from the Soviet of the past is that the sphere of voting and being elected has been enlarged .
Be they workers , peasants , women , intellectuals , students , merchants , or property owners , as long as they do not oppose resisting Japan and are at least 18 years of age , they have the right to vote and to be elected .
All the aspects discussed above link the resist @-@ Japan war with the democratic system and will produce a great effect .
Under such a system , regardless of his occupation or activities , everyone can manifest his talent .
Individuals with whatever skill can bring it to light .
Such is the nature of the Border Regionthe characteristics of the Border Region .
Once one understands such nature and characteristics , one will understand its national significance and function .
The nation should also adopt this system .
It should link the resist @-@ Japan war with the democratic system , striving for victory of the resist @-@ Japan war by the general introduction of the democratic system ..
If , in the whole nation , the people have full freedoms of speech , publication , meeting , and forming associations , the officers and soldiers in the army become one , the military and the civilian become one , education is pursued with the democratic spirit , economic construction is carried out by launching the strength of the people and linked with improving their life , the election system is introduced for all levels of the government , and the people &apos;s representative organs are formed on all levels , all for .
the purpose of striving for victory in the resistance war , then victory over Japan can be expected soon .
The democratic system is already a matter of history in foreign countries , but China has yet to introduce it .
The function of the Border Region is to set an example for the people of the entire nation , so that they will understand that this system is most beneficial to resisting Japan for national salvation , and the only correct war to resist Japan and save the nation .
This is the significance and function of the Border Region in the nation .
To have this system adopted in the whole country , the people of the entire country must truly understand it and find it feasible .
Therefore , we welcome the people of all parties and factions , and those without party or.factional affiliations , to come and take a look .
Many have come and looked , especially the young students .
Aside from a minority .who find this system not good , the majority find it good .
This is encouraging .
The Border Region is a part of China .
Under the leadership of the central government , it is similar to other parts of China , except for one point : This is an area which practices the democratic system .
It is the characteristic of the Border Region , and we hope it will spread throughout China .
Currently , there are two kinds of incorrect views of the Border Region : Some few obstinate elements say that nothing is good in the Border Region .
Apparently this view is incompatible with the facts .
Others say that this area is similar to paradise , without any defect .
This view is also excessive .
One should describe it correctly as follows : Its democratic system and anti @-@ Japanese spirit are very good , and deserve the emulation and reference of the people of the entire nation .
Nevertheless , the work here is still restricted by certain conditions , and material difficulty is one instance .
Many tasks await continued effort before they can be more successful .
It is not a situation where everything is excellent and no improvement needs to be sought .
Therefore , we welcome the.criticism of outsiders in order to make the work personnel here strive harder .
This must also be pointed out .
Now that you have favored us with your visit to Yenan , we welcome your criticisms , pointing out the defects for us to correct , and making it more beneficial to the great cause of resisting Japan to save the nation .
Question No 2 : What is the function of the Chinese Communist Party in China at the present time ?
Answer : This is a very simple question .
Persevering in the resistance war , persevering in the United Front , and persevering in a war of endurance constitute the basic principle of the Chinese Communist Party at the present time and its work and function in the entire nation .
What is persevering in the resistance war ?
To compromise or to persevere in the resistance war is an existing issue .
We advocate resistance to the final end and oppose any kind of compromise .
We with to persevere in the resistance war together with the Kuomintang and other parties and factions and the people of the entire nation , without wavering , until we recover our lost territory and reach the Yalu River .
What is persevering in the United Front ?
It means national unity to the very end .
Only when there is national unity will there be perseverance in the resistance war .
Though there is national unity at present , we must unite even more .
Not just uniting several parties and factions , but we must unite the people of the entire nation .
Only when the people of all fields in the nation are united in a definite organization and when they can all activate their positivity in the resistance war will the United Front be consolidated and expanded .
What is persevering in a war of endurance ?
China now has two types of people .
Those of one type say : &quot; China will perish ; it cannot wage a war of endurance . &quot;
Those of the other type say : &quot; China will soon expel Japanese imperialism ; there is no need for a war of endurance . &quot; We find both views incorrect .
First , China definitely will not perish .
Though Japan is powerful , its foundation is inadequate , and i t has many domestic and international conflicts ; though China is weak , it is a large country , and it has many superior domestic and international conditions .
Therefore , though China has lost much territory , it can persevere in the war and will win final victory .
However , it is difficult to defeat Japan soon , because , while there are conditions making victory possible , such conditions cannot be completely realized within a short period of time .
Be it China &apos;s progress , Japan &apos;s internal collapse , or international aid , all require a fairly long period of time before the goal is reached .
Hence , we must prepare for a long @-@ term war , and we must not hope for immediate victory .
Thus , the current policy must be : First , persevering in the resistance war ; second , persevering in the Anti @-@ Japanese United Front ; third , persevering in a war of endurance .
What does the Chinese Communist Party do in the country ?
The items discussed above are what it does .
The Chinese Communist Party wishes to unite with all parties , all factions , and .
the people of the whole country and implement the policy .
This is the function of the Chinese Communist Party in the entire nation .
Question No 3 : Does China have the conditions to shorten the duration of the war ?
Answer : To shorten the duration of the war , three conditions must be re @-@ enforced : First , China &apos;s United Front must be further consolidated and expanded .
This is fundamental .
Under the policy of the United Front , all items of work must be greatly developed and advanced .
Such development and advance will shorten the war by that much .
The second condition is the help of the people inside Japan .
Currently , such help has started , such as the unwillingness of the Japanese soldiers to fight , some committing suicide , some surrendering , and other distributing anti @-@ war handbills .
The anti @-@ war thinking of the Japanese people is , also developing .
If the soldiers and people of Japan will become more aware , the duration of the war will be shortened by that much .
The third condition is the help of the various nations in the world .
We need the help , of the world students , the help of the world people , and also the help of the governments of the nations .
If such help becomes greater and more prompt , then the war will be shortened .
These three conditions are mutually linked .
If China accelerates its progress and its unity , it will , in turn , accelerate the development of the helping strengths inside Japan and of the nations in the world .
If the development of the helping strength in Japan and the nations of the world is accelerated , it will , in turn , accelerate the development and progress of the anti @-@ Japanese strength in China .
China &apos;s blow to Japanese imperialism constitutes an aid to the Japanese people , and .
it will hasten the development of the liberation struggles of the Japanese people .
This applies to the world also .
China &apos;s resistance war is , at the same time , an aid to the people of
the world against our common enemy .
Therefore , the many kinds of antifascist forces of China , Japan , and the world are mutually Influencing and mutually aiding one another .
World peace cannot be divided ; the world is one entity .
This is the characteristic of world politics at present .
The greater the presence of the three conditions , the shorter will be the duration of the war .
It is the mission of the Chinese Communist Party and all the anti @-@ Japanese parties and factions and people , and also that of all the progressive parties and all the peoples of Japan and the world .
Ours is a war of endurance , but we must strive for the conditions to shorten it .
Without such conditions , the idea of shortening the war will be merely an empty thought .
Question No 4 : After the final victory of the resistance war , what will be the main mission of the Chinese Communist Party ?
Answer : After the victory of the resistance war , the main mission of the Communist Party , in a word , is to build .a free and equal democratic nation .
In such a nation , there will be an independent democratic government , a congress representing the people , and a constitution consistent with the people &apos;s wishes .
In such a nation , all the races are equal , and they will build their relations under the principle of equality .
In such a nation , there will be an independent democratic government , a congress representing the people , and a constitution.consistent with the people &apos;s wishes .
In such a nation , all the races are equal , and they will build their relations under the principle of equality .
In such a nation , the economy will develop ; agriculture , industry , and commerce will progress greatly , jointly operated by the state and the people .
There will be an 8 @-@ hour work system ; the peasants will own their land ; the unified graduated tax will be enforced ; there will be peaceful trading with foreign countries , and agreements of mutual benefit will be formed .
In such a nation , the people will have complete freedoms of speech , publication , meeting , association , and religion ; all types of superior talents will have a chance to develop ; science and culture will be advanced ; illiteracy will be wiped out in the entire country .
In such a nation , the troops are not opposed to the people , but become one with them .
Such a nation is not yet a socialist state , nor its government a Soviet government , but a state and a government practicing a complete democratic system and under the principle of respecting private.ownership.
Such is China &apos;s modern state .
China greatly needs such a state .
With such a state , China will depart from the semi @-@ colonial and semi @-@ feudal position and become a free and equal nation ; it will depart from the old China and become a new China .
The Communist Party desires to- unite with all parties and factions and the people of the entire country , &apos; so that everyone will strive to build such a nation .
Such a nation has been desired and striven for by the people of the entire country for several decades and by Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen .
The building of such a nation is not started the next day after chasing Japan to the Yalu River .
All items of work in the process of the resistance war are connected with the building of such a nation , except that many important tasks , such as basic economic construction , can only be completed after the victory of the resistance war .
During the resistance war , we must have the prerequisites for the building of such a nation , and the main thing is to expel Japanese imperialism .
Such a mission is not only that of the Communist
. 122
Party , but should also be that of the Kuomintang and other revolutionary parties and factions as well as that of the people of the entire nation .
It is ChinaTs historical mission .
Question No 5 : What do you think are the main tasks of China &apos;s students and young people in the resistance war ?
What are the main tasks of the students and young people of the workd in the movement to aid China ?
Answer : The tasks of China &apos;s young people may be classified into the general and the specific .
The general tasks are identical with what has been discussed before .
They are to persevere in the resistance war , to persevere in the United Front , to persevere in a war of endurance , to expel Japanese imperialism , and to build a free and equal democratic republic .
These are the common tasks of the people of China regardless of their age or occupation , without any distinction .
The distinction is in the specific tasks .
What are the specific tasks of China &apos;s youths ?
There specific tasks are to strive for their own .
specific interests , such as improvement of education and learning , the right to participate in the movement to save the nation while in school , the right to organize student and youth groups and to form national salvation organizations , the right to vote and to be elected for those 18 years of age or over , the right of the impoverished to attend school without paying tuition , the obligation of the young people to go to the front line in large groups , etc .
As for the main tasks of the world youths in helping China &apos;s resistance war , I feel that , first of all , they must , through the World Student Federation , make the majority of the world youths and students understand the necessity of jointly resisting Japan and helping China , and also the fact that such work is linked with their own interests .
As world peace cannot be divided , the fascist world aggression is the enemy of world peace .
Next , the students are the bridge to link with the people .
Through the students , the people of all nations must be made to understand the necessity to resist Japan and help China and the relations of such work with their own Interests .
As for the concrete means of help , they may include verbal and written propaganda , urging the people and governments to render us material aid , boycotting trade with Japan , or even organizing an international anti @-@ Japanese volunteer army and preparing to participate in the war in China at the proper time .
On behalf of a large international student organization , you come to China to inspect and give us your great sympathy .
All the people of China are grateful to you .
I salute you on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party , and the Chinese people !
I hope that , when you return to your countries , you will bring the truth of China &apos;s great resist @-@ Japan war to the students and people of the world .
Let you and us unite forever and fight for China &apos;s freedom and equality , and for the permanent peace happiness of the world !

OUR VIEWS ON THE NATIONAL POLITICAL COUNCIL 5 July 1938
&#91; Text &#93; The National Political Council will hold its meeting shortly .
Seven of our Chinese Communist Party members have been selected as council members .
The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has formally decided that our seven members will accept the government invitation and join the National Political Council .
For this reason , many reporters , council members * and Communist Party members and friends of all areas ask us for our views on the National Political Council .
We now jointly express our views as follows ;
In the violent environment of the resistance war , the holding of the National Political Council meeting apparently demonstrates progress of China &apos;s political life toward the democratic system ; it apparently demonstrates an advance of the unity of China &apos;s parties and factions , races , classes and strata , and regions .
Though in regard , to the method of creation and the provision of functions and powers , the National Political Council is not a plenipotentiary representative organ of the people as might be desired , it does not , for these reasons , lose its effect and meaning todaythe effect of further uniting all forces in the entire nation to wage the resistance war and save the nation and of an initiation of the nation &apos;s political life toward true democracy .
Therefore , besides continuing our effort to promote the formation of a plenipotentiary people &apos;s representative organ by means of popular election in the future , we Communist Party members will participate in the work of the National Political Council with a most positive , eager , and sincere attitude .
Meanwhile , we feel that the active participation in the work of the National Political Council constitutes a part of the important work to reenforce the defense of Wuch &apos;ang ~ Hankow and the resistance war effort of the third period ; it constitutes also a part of the foundation to promote the future formation of a people &apos;s plenipotentiary representative organ .
We will participate in the National Political Council on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party , sincerely wishing to join hands and strive together with the council member comrades of the Kuomintang and other parties and factions and of those without party or factional affiliations , in order to discuss and decide , in a friendly and harmonious manner , the concrete means and implementation measures beneficial to the victory of the resistance war and the building of the nation ,
so that we will deal effective blows to and defeat the Japanese bandits and lay the foundation for an independent , free , and happy new nation of China .
To attain the goal of defeating the Japanese bandits and building an independent , free , and happy new nation , we must , primarily , in the military aspect , seek the strengthening of the combat power of the troops on the front line , the large @-@ scale expansion of the people &apos;s guerrilla warfare in enemy occupied areas , and the creation of vigorous troops with modern equipment ; in the political aspect , improve the political structures , promote the building of provincial , county , and local public opinion organs , and generally launch and organize the broad masses to actively participate in the war ; in the economic aspect , intensify the creation of national defense industries , readjust the wartime finance and currency , raise the industrial and agricultural production . , and safeguard and improve the people &apos;s livelihood by means of all kinds of effective measures .
Meanwhile , all military , political , and economic improvements hinge on the continuous consolidation and expansion of the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front .
All these items have been discussed repeatedly and in .detail in the documents and declarations of the Chinese Communist Party in the past several years ( such as the Declaration of 1 August 1935 , the Ten Great Policies for Anti @-@ Japanese Resistance and National Salvation published in September last year , the Declaration of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee on the Current Situation made in December last year , and the views of the leading comrades and members of the Party ) , and we trust they are well known to the people of the country .
In actively participating in the work of the National Political Council , we will sincerely implement all instructions of the Central of our party and continue to strive for the realization of the advocations of our.party in the resistance war period .
At the first session of the National Political Council , the iron hooves of the enemy have entered the heartland of China ; enemy artillery is permeating the regions of the Yangtze , Huai , Yellow , and Han rivers ; Anhwei , Kiangsi , Hunan , and Hupeh are under enemy threat ; Wu @-@ ch &apos;ang @-@ Hankow has become the target of enemy reconnaissance .
Therefore , our most urgent problem is how to defend Wuch &apos;ang @-@ Hankow and win the victory of the third period resistance war .
Currently , we feel that the most urgent issues requiring prompt solutions are roughly as follows : How to mobilize the military strength , manpower , finance , and material to defend .
Wuch &apos;ang @-@ Hankow , our military , political , economic , and communication center , and effectively wage the third period resistance war ; how to reform the current conscription system with its innumerable defects and replace it with the recruiting system by broad political mobilization , so that the troops of China will have continuous replacements with soldiers possessing a vigorous national consciousness and the creation of a new army will progress promptly , and effectively ; how to adopt concrete measures to truly attain the goal that &quot; those with money will donate money ; &quot; how to guarantee the minimum improvement of the people &apos;s life so that those
with strength will donate their strength ; how to generally activate and organize the masses and , at the same time , unify the mass movements and organizations under the general principle of the resistance war and democracy ; how to safeguard the people &apos;s freedoms of speech , meeting , publication , and association and the legitimate rights of the resistance war parties and factions ; how to truly and effectively train the young people , so that they can shoulder the responsibilities of cadres to resist Japan and build the nation , in order to overcome their disappointment over the many young people &apos;s training classes today ; how to improve the political structures of all levels , primarily those of the county level and below ; how to conscientiously promote local self @-@ government .
All these are urgently desired by the people of the entire nation and necessary to the victory of the resistance war .
We will discuss them with those in all fields holding the same , views and propose bills in the National Political Council .
Today , the enemy bandits are creating , havoc and our front line soldiers are fighting bloody battles for the survival of the nation of China .
In the great and noble national battlefield , our thousands and tens of thousands of soldiers , without distinction of parties and factions , without distinction of boundaries , are mutually helping one another , turning the gun muzzles toward the enemy with one mind and one heart , and gloriously merging their blood together .
We believe that , in the meeting hall of the National Political Council , similar to the battlefield of the National Liberation War , all the council members will absolutely not discriminate between the &quot; party in power &quot; and the &quot; party out of power &quot; or engage in any prejudicial disputes between parties and factions ; on.the contrary , they will sweep aside all misunderstandings without distinction of parties or factions , without distinction of areas , and jointly and unanimously devote their effort to the final victory of the resistance war , because the program of the resistance war and national construction promulgated by the Kuomintang Provisional Congress is not only recognized by the Party as being basically identical in direction in its wartime political policy with the Party &apos;s wartime program , but also approved by other parties and factions .
The National Government and its national policy to persevere in a long @-@ term resistance war and strive for the final victory of the state and the nation are unanimously supported by the people of the entire nation .
On such foundation , we believe that the work of the National Political Council will be successful in an atmosphere , of harmony and friendship .
Finally , we Communist Party council members will not evade in the slightest our proper , responsibilities in front of the people of the entire nation just because the National Political Council has not been created by popular election .
We deeply realize that , as the National Political Council.members are the public servants of the people , their messengers , and their representatives , we will faithfullyfollow their instructions and their will and work hard ; we will struggle for the realization of the will , desire , and demand of the people of China .
We firmly believe that consolidating the national unity and expelling the Japanese bandits constitute the most urgent demand of the people of China today .
We will not relax , nor fear difficulties , but will firmly and faithfully struggle hard for the satisfactory realization of this most urgent demand inside and outside the National Political Council .
We hope that
the people of the entire nation , whether individuals or organizations , will give us instructions and help .
If we make mistakes , we hope you will criticize and censure us .
We hope that we and all the council members , as the people &apos;s representatives in a sacred public opinion organ , will , under the help , supervision , encouragement , and criticism of the people of the entire nation , fulfill the responsibilities of the National Political Council and of each and every council member .

MESSAGE OF GREETINGS FROM COMRADE MAO TSE @-@ TUNG TO THE NATIONAL POLITICAL COUNCIL
6 July 1938
&#91; Text &#93; Council Chairman .
Mr Wang Ching @-@ wei and Vice Chairman Mr Chang Po @-@ ling of the WuchTang @-@ Hankow National Political Council and the entire council membership :
At this time , upon the anniversary of the resistance war , when the entire nation , from top to bottom , is united together , rallying time and again in spite of the setbacks , and swearing to expel the powerful bandits , while the enemy attacks are becoming ever more ferocious , the holding.of the meeting of the National Political Council in Wu @-@ ch &apos;ang @-@ rHankow provides a precedent for a constitutional government , and initiates the expression of the public opinion .
All people of the nation celebrate and rejoice deeply over the event .
I have a seat on the council .
However , due to trivial matters , I am .
unable to personally attend and listen to your noble discussions .
Nevertheless , I have .entrusted my comrades to express my limited personal views beneficial to the momentous issues of the resistance war and national construction , in order to contribute my little effort .
The calamity is pressing in on us and the nation is in danger of perdition , but the public opinion has been expressed , and there is a great hope to turn the tide .
While the means to turn the tide are many , I feel that the following three points are the most fundamental : The first is to persevere in the resistance war ; the second is to persevere in the United Front ; the third is to persevere in a war of endurance .
If we can advance with these points in mind , without relaxation , victory will doubtlessly be ours .
On this day of the inauguration of the council , I solemnly send this cable to congratulate you , and I extend to you my national revolutionary salute .

ON THE MEW STAGE 12 @-@ 14 October 1938
The new stage of development in the national war against Japan and the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Fronta report made at the sixth enlarged plenum of the Sixth CCP Central Committee held from 12 @-@ 14 October 1938 .
.
&#91; Text &#93; Comrades , I am representing the Central Political Bureau to make a report to the sixth enlarged plenum of the Sixth.CCP Central Committee .
What am I prepared to talk about ?
What I need to talk about is divided into several parts as follows : 1 ) from the fifth to the sixth enlarged plenums of the Sixth Central Committee ; 2 ) summation of the 15 months of war against Japan ; 3 ) the new stage of development of the war against Japan and the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front ; 4 ) current urgent tasks for the entire nation ; 5 ) a protracted war and long @-@ term cooperation ; 6 ) China &apos;s war against agression and the world @-@ wide anti @-@ fascist movement ; 7 ) the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s position in the national war ; 8 ) the Seventh National Party Congress .
These are the questions I wish to address .
Comrades , what tasks are we to carry out by convening the sixth enlarged plenum of the Sixth CCP Central Committee in the midst of a situation in which we hear gunfire echoing all over the country , and find the peril of world war pressing upon us .so urgently ?
What , are our objectives ?
We definitely must forever unite with all patriotic parties , factions , and compatriots throughout the nation , overcome new difficulties , and mobilize new forces to stop the enemy &apos;s attacks for the present , and carry out our counterattacks in the future , so as to attain the objective of driving out Japanese imperialism and establish a republic based on the Three People &apos;s Principles .
We absolutely must have freedom , we definitely will winthese are our objectives , and it is also the general orientation of my report .
From the Fifth to the Sixth Enlarged Plenums of the Sixth CCP Central Committee .
The Convening of the Sixth Enlarged Plenum of the Sixth CCP Central Committee .
It has been nearly five years now since the general membership meeting of our party &apos;s Sixth Central Committee held its fifth plenum in Kiangsi Province in January 1934 .
We were unable to gather together in one body because the various Central Committee members were scattered all over the country and abroad working under various different situations .
But , this time , most of the Central Committee members are attending , with the exception of a few comrades .
Moreover , many comrades who are leaders of various tasks from various areas throughout the country have also come .
This has made this general membership meeting the one with the greatest number of people attending since the convening of the Sixth Enlarged Plenum .
Originally , it was intended for the Seventh Congress of the CCP Central Committee to be convened this year , but we had to postpone it until next year because of the urgency of the war .
But the current situation has set before us many problems which must be clearly resolved in order to achieve victory in the war against Japan .
Therefore , we have convened this enlarged general membership meeting of the CCP Central Committee .
From the Fifth to the Sixth Plenums
In the past 5 years , our party had experienced very many events of great importance .
The transition of a situation in which the various parties , factions , and classes in the country were opposed to each other to that of the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front , and the transformation of the civil war into a war against Japan , are the biggest and most important events .
The unfortunate disruption of the United Front of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in 1927 was the reason that caused the civil war in the past .
This was created by the historical circumstances of that time .
How , then , was the policy of the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front formed ?
It was formed because of the new historical circumstances .
Since the 18 September Incident , Japanese imperialismthe enemy of the Chinese nation after carrying out the first step of aggression against the four eastern provinces is now entering the stage of .taking the second step of preparing to and carrying out the aggression against all of China .
This kind of unprecedented historical event has brought about a transformation in domestic and international situations .
First of all , it has transformed , and is transforming , the mutual relationships of the various classes , parties , factions , and cliques within the country , and , at the same time , it has transformed , and is transforming , mutual relationships on the international scene .
In accordance with this unprecedented historical event and the new relationships both domestically and internationally , our Party , as far back as 1933 , had begun to take a .
new road on its political standpoint ( setting up agreements , based on the three conditions to fight against the Japanese , with any elements within the Kuomintang who are willing to cooperate with us ) , raising it to the level of a new policy of the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front .
For this reason the August 1935 proclamation was published , the December decision was made , the August 1936 letter to the Kuomintang was written , and the September resolution of the democratic republic was passed .
Furthermore , it was these that enabled us to adhere to the policy of
peaceful resolution of the Sian Incident which occurred in December of that year , and to forward to the Kuomintang &apos;s Third Congress a concrete proposal to unite against the Japanese in .February 1937 .
In May of last year , a congress of a temporary nature was convened ( it was called a congress of the Soviet areas attended at that time by representatives from Soviet and non @-@ Soviet areas , as well as from the Red Army ) , It passed the &quot; Tasks of the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front at the Present Stage , &quot; and approved the implementation of the reorganization of the Red Army into the People &apos;s Revolutionary Army , and the implementation of a transformation into a democratic system in the Soviet areas .
Thus in reality a transition was made from a situation of civil war into a new era of a beginning to establish the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front .
It was also at that time that the Chinese Nationalist Party slowly began to change its policy , gradually turning toward a position of unification against the Japanese .
Without such a transition in the KuomintangTs policy it would not have been possible even if it was desired , to form the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front .
During that period , many national salvation groups began to have their own organizations , and other parties and factions also made demands to oppose the Japanese .
The measures taken by Japanese imperialism to commit aggression against China and destroy it encountered unprecedented opposition from the entire nation , because of the change in policies of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party , the leadership of Mr.
Chiang Kai @-@ shek , = the support of the military and the people of the whole country , and the cooperation of other cliques and parties and factions .
Following the Lukouchiao Incident on 7 July last year , all China , under the unified leadership of the national leader and supreme commander , Generalissimo Chiang , erupted with sounds of.sacred and righteous gunfire .
All China was transformed into an unprecedented massive unity of the great Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front .
In August of last year , 2 months after the Lukouchiao Incident , our Party announced the Ten Great Policies for Anti @-@ Japanese Resistance and National Salvation .
At the same time the reorganization of the Eighth Route Army was completed , and it marched to North China to fight .
On 22 September our Party made a public announcement of a proclamation to unite with the Kuomintang , in purest honesty based upon the Three People &apos;s Principles , and face the national peril together .
The second day , Mr.
Chiang Kai @-@ shek , the supreme leader of the Kuomintang , the national government , and the national revolutionary army , published a talk in which he admitted the legal existence of the Communist Party and to unite with it to save the nation .
Thenceforth , the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front , based upon the Kuomintang and the Communist Party , was completely established .
In December our party , in order to consolidate and develop the Anti @-@ Japanese National Unified Front , again proclaimed its willingness not only to cooperate with the Kuomintang in opposing the Japanese , but also in .
national construction .
Soon after , the guerrilla units of the Red Army in the South reorganized to form the New Fourth Army and marched to the south of the Yangtze River to fight against the Japanese .
Thereafter , anti @-@ Japanese unity improved daily .
Comrades , this kind of transition from 10 years of war between the two parties to a new cooperation between them , and carrying out this transition under conditions of extreme difficulties , stabilized the initial foundation of long @-@ term cooperation between the two parties .
These were accomplished only after
going through a lot of difficulties but it was accomplished finally through the efforts of the Central Committee and the entire Party .
The Comintern fully approved this new political line our Party had taken . ( see &quot; New China Daily &apos;s &quot; 9 September report on the Comintern &apos;s resolution ) , and , furthermore , called upon the proletariat of the world and the communist parties of the various countries to give aid to China &apos;s war against the Japanese .
Comrades , if there had not been such an undertaking , establishment , and adherence to the.Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front , based upon the Kuomintang and the Communist Party , it would have been impossible to launch this great anti @-@ Japanese national revolutionary war , persevere and .win victory , Now , people all over China and the world understand that the Chinese nation has stood up !
One hundred years of insult , ridicule , aggression , and oppression , especially the shameful position of a slave after the 18 September Incident , have been altered .
People of all China , with gunds in their hands , have marched onto the battlefields of the war of national self @-@ defense , and the dawning of hope for freedom and liberation of the Chinese nation has begun .
We knew that this great national war of ours today is different from all wars in the historical eras of China .
Because this war is for the liberation of the Chinese nation from a semi @-@ colonial position , and from the perils of losing the nation and destruction of the race .
Furthermore , this war is being fought in the most progressive era of China &apos;s history ; at the same time , this war is fought during the period in which our enemy , Japanese imperialism , , is seeking a path of self @-@ destruction and collapse .
At the same time , this war is fought in an era in which the progressive mankind of the world is preparing its forces for struggle on an unprecedentedly enlarged scale , and unprecedented intensity , in order to oppose and overcome the evil devils of the Gertnan @-@ Italian @-@ Japanese fascists and achieve a bright future for the world .
This kind of unification of factors from three sides with the advancement and continuous progress of China as the principal cornerstoneassures that our war against Japan will surely win final victory , and a free and liberated new China will emerge with certainty in the Orient and become an important , integral element in the bright world of the future .
Such a China will give prosperity not only to China &apos;s 400 million people , but also to all mankind .
The Tasks of the Sixth Plenum of the Sixth CCP Central Committee .
The sixth enlarged plenum of the Sixth CCP Central Committee is held at a crucial moment when the anti @-@ Japanese war is at the point of entering a new developmental stage , and the sixth enlarged plenum of the Sixth CCP Central Committee has shouldered a historical task of great importance .
It is absolutely correct that the anti @-@ Japanese war has been courageously fought for over a year now , and throughout the nation there is great unity and magnificent progress .
It has dealt a severe blow to Japanese imperialism .
Although we have lost much territory , we have won many victories .
This is a fact that cannot be denied .
It may also be predicted that final victory
will be ours , and not the enemy &apos;s , as the war develops further , mainly because of China &apos;s continuous progress , which , at the same time , is coordinated with the increasing difficulties of Japan and international assistance to make us stronger .
Whoever cannot see the magnificent achievements of the past and the victorious future will fall into the deep pit of pessimism and will be unable to extract himself .
However , it is not enough to see only this side of the matter .
There is another side to the anti @-@ Japanese war , the negative side , and this is the problem that faces us .
The present situation tells us that all the struggles , unity , progress , and victories in the past year and more in China , have not been able to stop the enemy &apos;s advance , and we still do not have the strength to go on the counteroffensive .
Wuhan is being threatened by the enemy , and he will also mount attacks against Canton , Changsha , and areas of the northwest .
Therefore , the people of the entire country expect the Communist Party to make proposals .
The new situation has set forth many problems .
Comrades , we must make proposals , we must solve these problems .
It is correct that our Party long ago gave its proposals , and many of the basic problems have been resolved , too , a long time ago .
But the new situation demands that we make new proposals and solve new problems .
What is the new problem ?
How to increase new forces on the present foundation to pass over the difficult phase of the war , stop the enemy &apos;s attacks , prepare to mount our counterattacks , and achieve the objective of driving out the enemythese are the key questions of the current problem .
A countless number of people all over the country discuss and worry over this problem .
Should or should we not address this problem ?
Without doubt we should address it .
This problem has developed various aspects and many problems have risen .
For instance , what has the experience of 15 months of resistance war proved .
Has it proved that the war will be a protracted one or a brief one ?
Is the strategic policy to be a protracted war so as to overcome the enemy or a quick one to win victory against the enemy ?
Is final victory to be China &apos;s or the enemy &apos;s ?
Is the way out through war or through compromise ?
If the war should be a protracted one , then what means should be adopted to support a drawn @-@ out war and win final victory ?
Can any basis be found in the 15 months of war experience so that a clear answer can be given ?
All these are important problems and they belong to one category .
Again , for example , how to develop and transform the entire course of the war against Japan ?
What , in actuality , is the nature of this so @-@ called new stage ?
Suppose we do not defend Wuhan , what then will be the trend of the war ?
Henceforth , in which direction should the efforts of the entire nation be directedthat is , the current urgent tasks of the Chinese nation ?
What effective means do we have to pass through the great difficulties of the war ?
These are even more important problems and belong to another category .
Again , for instance , what will .happen to the future and the perspective of the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party ?
On what
basis does the Communist Party speak of long @-@ term cooperation ?
What means does the Communist Party have to improve the relationship between the two parties ?
What kind of nation is to be established with regard to the so @-@ called cooperation not only in the war effort , hut also in .
the national construction ?
What are the relationships between the Three People &apos;s Principles and communism ?
These are also very important questions and they again belong to another category .
Once more , for example , with the world &apos;s political climate in such a state of emergency , what will its situation become ?
What advantages or disadvantages are there in the relationship between the anti @-@ Japanese war of China and the world , movement to oppose fascism ?
These are.also important questions , and they belong to still another category .
Furthermore , what is the position of the Chinese Communist Party in the national war ?
What kind of attitude should a Communist Party member adopt in his work when he struggles to implement the Party &apos;s policitcal policies ?
What other effective methods do the Communist Party have in cooperation with other parties and in liaison with the people to bring about a transition of the situation from a difficult period to one of smooth sailing ?
How are the internal relationships of the Communist Party ?
Are there any effective methods to bring about unity in the entire Party so as to enable it to play its great role in the war against Japan , specially in the current difficult situation ?
What is to become of the Seventh Congress of the CCP Central Committee ?
These are also important problems and they belong to yet another category .
All these problems are urgently demanding for solutions within the party and outside of it .
In the recent several months we have constantly encountered people requesting answers to these questions .
Comrades , our nation is a big .
and complicated one , and it is now engaged in a life @-@ or @-@ death struggle with a strong imperialist country .
This struggle is .drawing near to a new developmental stage , and it is currently situation in the transition period .
Our sixth enlarged plenum is being held in this period and its responsibilities are very , very important as we must resolve many problems .
A General Summation of 15 Months of War
What Has the Experience of 15 Months Proved ?
Let us begin from the experience gained during the 15 months .
What have we gained from the experience of 15 months of war ?
I hold that in the main there are three aspects .
First , it has proved that the war against Japan is a protracted , and not a brief one .
Therefore , the strategy for the war of resistance is protracted warfare and not a blitzkreig type of war .
Second , it has proved that China &apos;s war of resistance can win final victory , and there is no basis for pessimism .
Third , it has proved that the only correct road that will support a protracted war .
and win final victory is that of unifying and uniting the entire nation , striving hard for improvement and relying on the masses , , and applying them to overcome difficulties and secure
victory .
There is no other way .
The War of Resistance Against Japan Is Not a Brief War But a Protracted One , and the Strategy Is Protracted Warfare , Not a Quick and Decisive Campaign
When the war of resistance first broke out , many people assumed that the war would soon be over , and the idea of a quick victory prevailed for a while .
.This was so because they did not proceed from the basic comparison of the strength of the enemy and ours , but from some temporary and superficial phenomena .
However , at the Double Ten festival last year , Generalissimo Chiang clearly pointed out : &quot; This war of resistance will not be over in a short time .
It must go through a period of extreme sufferings and difficulties before it can achieve final victory . &quot; As for us , we pointed out a long time ago the protracted nature of the anti @-@ Japanese war of resistance , and that it could not be resolved in a short period of time .
&quot; The outcome of the war is inevitable victory for China and unavoidable defeat for Japan , however , the sacrifices will be great , and there will be a period of great sufferings &quot; ( 16 July 1936 talk between Mao Tse @-@ tung and Snow ) .
&quot; It should be perceived that this war of resistance is a very difficult , protracted war &quot; ( the 15 August 1937 resolution passed by the CCP Central Committee on the current situation and the Party &apos;s tasks ) .
These all pointed out that the anti @-@ Japanese war of resistance is a protracted.war and not a short one , the strategy is protracted warfare and not a quick , decisive campaign .
The experience of the past 15 months of the war of resistance has completely proved this to be correct .
What is the reason for this ?
It is because the enemy is powerful and we are weak , the enemy is in a superior , and we are in an inferior position , and the enemy is an imperialist country and we are a semi @-@ colonial nation .
We long ago pointed out that there must be three conditions in order to be victorious over the enemy : firstly , China must be progressive , and this is the basic and principal thing ; secondly , Japan &apos;s difficulties ; and thirdly , international assistance .
Let us take a look at these three conditions during the 15 months of the war of resistance .
In short , they already have a foundation , but it is still a long way from the degree they must attain .
With regard to the first condition ( the basic and principal condition for victory against the enemy ) , China &apos;s progressiveness , a base has been formed in the past 15 months , but only through continuing progress can we finally overcome the enemy .
What is meant by the progress of China encompasses all aspects of domestic politics , military affairs , Party tasks , people &apos;s movements , and cultural education .
In these respects , progress has been very obvious during the past 15 months .
However , we cannot stop the enemy &apos;s attacks with only these and launch our counteroffensive .
In order to counterattack there must be a period of preparations .
There must be an intensive and wide @-@ spread mobilization of all new forces in our nation through the effort of all the people in order to be able to mount a counterattack and defeat the enemy .
Therefore , the theory of quick victory has no basis , because it has forgotten the salient point that the enemy is powerful and we are weak , that the enemy is in a superior and we are in an inferior position , that the enemy is an imperialist nation and we are a semi @-@ colonial country .
China has a vast latent potential , and when this potential is mobilized it is ample enough to turn defeat into victory , weakness into strength , and
basically alter the situation between the enemy and us all by itself .
However , it is not an existing fact , and it will require our efforts henceforth .
As for the second condition , .
Japan &apos;s difficulties , it is also the same .
During these 15 months the enemy put into the field a million men , sustained casualties in the hundreds of thousands , and expended hundreds of millions .
The morale of the troops disintegrates daily , and its finances and economy are being exhausted daily .
International opinions are rising all around to censure Japan , and it all resulted from the barbaric aggression of Japan and China &apos;s heroic war of resistance .
But these existing difficulties of the enemy are still inadequate to stop the attacks of the enemy and benefit our counter @-@ offensive .
We must wait for the day when the enemy has even greater difficulties and we have made even greater progress , and then only will the opportunity come to counterattack and be victorious over the enemy .
Therefore , with regard to the enemy situation , the theory of quick victory does not have a basis , which has been proved by the experience of 15 months .
On the third condition , international assistance , it is still not the time of greatest benefit for us .
In the past 15 months , we have the support of broad international opinion .
.
The Soviet Union and other democratic countries , in accordance with the resolution of the League of Nations , have already given us a lot of assistance .
This proved that we are not alone .
However , we must realize that the international peace front has different situations in different countries .
Among the capitalist countries the people are helping us , but the governments have adopted to a certain degree a neutral attitude .
Their bourgeoisie is taking advantage of this war to do business , and they are still transporting large quantities of armaments , and materials for making them , to Japan .
The socialist countries are basically different from the capitalist countries , and this has already been manifested in a concrete manner on the question of aid to China .
But the international situation currently does not permit them to provide assistance over and beyond the present degree .
Therefore , we , for the time being , must not place too much hope on international aid .
To discard the policy of self @-@ reliance and mainly place our hopes on assistance from abroad is , beyond doubt , an error of the greatest magnitude .
The experience gained from the past 15 months has proved that relying mainly upon our own efforts , and at the same time maintaining our efforts to win assistance from- abroad , is the correct path to be taken .
In this regard , past experience has also negated the theory of quick victory .
In general , the experience of the past 15 months proved that , regardless of whether it is with respect to China , the enemy , or the international &#91; aspects &#93; , the proposal of the theory of quick victory has no basis at all .
On the contrary , it has exposed the protracted and cruel nature of the war .
Therefore , our strategy absolutely must not be for a quick and decisive campaign , but should be one for protracted warfare .
The only correct policy for the war of resistance against Japan is to prolong the war and win against the enemy .
Those who did not believe this policy in the past have not been taught a lesson by reality , and they should no longer have any doubts now !
This is the first summation on the 15 months of war of resistance .
Final Victory Belongs to China , and Pessimists Have No Basis
Prior to the war of resistance , the theory of weapons only predominated on a grand scale .
The view was that China &apos;s weapons were inferior , and we would be destroyed if we.fought and China would become &apos;another Abyssinia .
After the war of resistance was launched , this kind of opinion seemed to have disappeared , but it was still circulating in the dark .
Whenever the war of resistance reached a critical situation , this kind of opinion would.emerge to stir up trouble .
It held that China should stop the war and negotiate for peace as it was no longer able to continue fighting , and should it continue to do so it would be inevitably destroyed .
We took the opposing stand .
We held that China &apos;s weapons were in fact inferior to others , but weapons could be strengthened through the efforts of man .
In war , victory or defeat is mainly decided by the human factor , not by materials .
Based upon the efforts of the entire nation , the result of a protracted war will be that of China slowly overcoming its weaknesses and strengthening its forces , transforming passivity into initiative , and inferiority into superiority .
At the same time , the difficulties on the enemy &apos;s side will slowly increase , and international aid to us will slowly grow .
When all these factors are combined , we will , in the end , be able to defeat Japanese imperialism .
Long ago , Generallissimo .
Chiang clearly indicated that &quot; since the war has already begun , there is only one way , and that is to go all out with all the strength of our nation and sacrifice to the end ..
There will no longer be such a thing as stopping mid @-@ way and compromising &quot; ( in the talk given at Lu Shan last July ) .
&quot; This war of resistance is a course which the people &apos;s revolution must go through , and it is a war of preservation fought by the victim against the aggressor .
It is totally different from the usual warring nations of matching strength .
Therefore , our reliance is placed not on weapons or military preparedness but on the powerful , unyielding revolutionary spirit and the strong , unbending national will &quot; ( in the letter to the people published in December of last year ) .
As for the Chinese Communist Party , it had long ago pointed out that &quot; the drain on Japan by China &apos;s protracted resistance has brought its economy to near collapse and the morale of its troops to near disintegration .
But for China , its latent power to wage a war of resistance surges higher and higher daily .
When all these factors are combined with others , it will enable us to mount the attack on all the territory occupied by Japan in the end , and drive Japan &apos;s army of aggression out of China . &quot; ( Talk between Mao Tse @-@ tung and Snow ) .
&quot; We believe that through the efforts of the people throughout the country , the war of resistance that has been launched will certainly sweep away all obstacles and continue to advance and develop .
Victory is certain for the war of resistance against Japan only if tens of millions of the masses are truly organized and join the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front . &quot; ( The August resolution passed by the Chinese Communist Party last year ) .
All these have been evidenced by the experience of the past 15 months .
It has been proved that such absurd falsehoods as &apos; the enemy is too strong to resist , 1 &apos; China cannot stand a fight , &apos; and &apos; compromise is the only way out &apos; spoken by pessimists and those who held that China will fall are totally wrong .
What is the reason for this ?
Because the fact that the enemy is strong and we are weak is but one side of the coin .
The enemy still has its weaknesses , China still has its strong points .
What are the weaknesses of the enemy ?
First , it is a smaller country .
It is inadequate in troops and finances , and cannot withstand a prolonged drain .
Because of its shortage of troops it is forced to split them and sustain attrition in the face of China &apos;s strong resistance so that it cannot occupy the whole of China , with regard to the territories it occupied it consist in reality only the big cities , highways , and certain areas of the plains .
The rest still belongs to China .
Second , the nature of the war waged by the enemy is imperialistic and very backward .
The contraditions within itself forced the enemy to launch a war of aggression , and it also compelled the enemy to adopt an extremely barbaric policy of plunder .
Thus , it transformed the enemy &apos;s war on the one hand into a war that places the entire Chinese people in absolute opposition , forcing them to unite and wage a war of determined resistance regardless of class , party , or faction .
On the other hand it is also transformed into a war which is in absolute opposition with its own people .
The results of Japanese imperialism &apos;s all @-@ out measures , with regard to manpower and finances in order to meet the needs of war , have begun to create much discontent among the people in its own country , and among .the troops on the front lines .
As the war develops it will without doubt force its people and soldiers to lean , en masse , in the direction of using resolute methods to oppose the war itself .
These have already surfaced during.the 15 months .
This is the most important basis existing on the enemy &apos;s side which will inevitably bring about defeat to it .
Third , precisely because the war the enemy is waging is Imperialistic by nature , in other words , selfishness , it will compel the enemy to place all countries whose interests are contrary to its own In the opposition camp .
With the exception of two or three fascist countries , all other countries , specially the masses of people of these countries , do not approve Japan &apos;s war of aggression , Thus Japan is forced to narrow gradually its sphere of international activities , and daily becomes more and more isolated .
This also has already begun to be evident during the 15 months .
Therefore , the comparative smallness of the country of Japan affected its troop strength , and its finances are insufficient ; the backward nature of Japan &apos;s war ; and Japan &apos;s international isolationall these are combined at the same time , and it becomes Japan &apos;s innate weaknesses and difficulties , and also these weaknesses and difficulties are growing daily .
Those who hold that the nation will fall and the pessimists are completely blind and can see only one thing , that the enemy is strong and we are weak .
Therefore , with respect to the enemy situation , there is no basis for pessimism or to holding the view that the nation will fall , so their policy of compromise can only be a policy for the downfall of the nation .
We are theoreticians of final victory , and our view has ample basis with respect to the enemy situation .
This has also begun to be evident during the 15 months .
What are our superior points ?
Firstly , we are a &quot; big country with a vast territory , rich resources , many people , and many soldiers .
Regardless of the fact that the enemy has occupied our principal big cities and communications lines , we still have a large tract of land left to form a base for our protracted war and.wrest final victory .
As for the enemy occupied areas , we still have.many bases for guerrilla warfare .
This characteristic is basically different from such small countries.as Czechoslovakia and Belgium .
This is our first superior point .
Secondly , our present anti @-@ Japanese war of resistance is different from any of the wars in the history of China .
Our war is a national revolutionary war , a progressive war .
Not only is the war itself progressive by nature , but it is fought upon a progressive foundation never before seen in China .
China in the second decade of the 20th century was different from the China of any other historical era .
We have progressive people quite different from those of any other historical period , and a progressive political party and progressive army .
The anti @-@ Japanese war of resistance which is being fought upon such a foundation , encompasses a great force that can continue to develop this progressiveness .
This is what we have on our side which will enable us to support a protracted war and achieve final victory .
The experience gained from the past 15 months has proved that the sacred national war carried out on its original base has already impelled the progress of all China .
The old tradition of national corruption is being destroyed , a new national progressive force is developing , and the developmental stage of the unification and progress of an entire nation is advancing toward completion .
The China after the war of resistance is different from the China preceding it , and this can be perceived by anyone with eyes .
It also may be predicted that the China of the first stage of the war of resistance ( this stage has not ended yet ) will be different from the China in the later stages .
Thirdly . , our anti @-@ Japanese war of resistance is not isolated .
China &apos;s anti @-@ Japanese war of resistance and the world &apos;s struggle against aggression and fascism are inseparably bound together , regardless of whether capitalist countries still preserve their many contradicting policies and regardless of whether the international situation may temporarily affect the degree of aid given by the various countries to us .
It is not only the Chinese that are opposing the Japanese war of aggression , but also Europeans , Americans , Africans9 Australians , and other Asians .
The sympathy and aid extended by the various countries of the world during these 15 months have given us this sure confidence .
That China , which has mainly relied on its own efforts , can , at the same time , coordinate with world aid , is because todayTs world is no longer the world it used to be .
Progressive mankind of the entire world has formed , into one body of close association .
.The enemy &apos;s plan to isolate us will not avail .
In this &apos;respect , ours is a very big country , our war is progressive , and we also have international assistance .
These three factors are combined at the same time .
These are all conditions favorable to us .
They not only already exist , they grow daily- Here , the pessimists and the subjugationists are both blind , unable to see anything at all .
All they can see is that we are a weak country , our position is inferior , and we are a semi @-@ colonial country .
They mumble such nonsense as &quot; the nation will surely fall if we wage a war
of resistance , &quot; and , &quot; if we carry on with the war , the nation will inevitably fall . &quot; The evil fellows among them covertly carry out their scheme to surrender and compromise upon the basis of such nonsensical talk .
We , .on.
the contrary , point out , based on the experience of the past 15 months , the strong points and weaknesses of our country and of our war , to the entire Party and the entire : country the conditions that are favorable to us and those that are not , and also point out clearly the superior position these strong points and favorable conditions hdld with regard to the war as a whole .
We shall call upon the entire nation to put its effort into the struggle , give rein to our own strong points , strengthen our own favorable conditions , overcome our own weaknesses and unfavorable conditions , and struggle to win final victory .
To whom will final victory belong ?
We answer decisively ; China .
Our policies are decided upon this basis : resolutely resist or vacillate and compromise ?
We answer with decision : there absolutely cannot be any vacillation and compromise .
The only way out is through resolutely waging a war of resistance .
The loss of the four eastern provinces , the annihilation of Austria , and the carving up of Czechoslovakia , are the result of no resistance .
This is quite obvious to all .
It is the same now .
With all the superior conditions in China , the war of resistance will inevitably thrive .
But if the road of compromise is taken , destruction cannot be avoided .
Therefore , the only policy is to resolutely oppose compromise @-@ ism and pessimism , and rouse the entire nation to fight courageously to the end .
In general , this contradicting comparisonthe enemy strength and our weakness has decided the protracted nature of the war , and the strategic policy of protracted warfare .
We hold the theory of victory over the enemy through prolongation and not the theory of quick victory .
The enemy is small and we are big ; the enemy &apos;s war is a backward one and ours is progressive ; the enemyTs position on the international scene is comparatively isolated while ours can get outside assistance .
These contradictory comparisons again decide that final victory of the war belongs to us , and not to the enemy .
This is the second summation of the experience of 15 months .
The Only Way To Support a Protracted War and In Final Victory Lies in Unifying and Uniting the Entire Nation , Striving for Progress , and Relying Upon the Masses
The anti @-@ Japanese war of resistance is a protracted one , and final victory belongs to China : these two basic questions have already been proved by the experience gained from 15 months of the war of resistance .
But what about &quot; a concrete program for supporting a protracted war and winning final victory ?
In the past , people in the country did not have a uniform opinion .
Many people held that it would be sufficient to carry on as in the past .
They did not pay attention to uniting the whole country , nor did they pay attention to military affairs , politics , culture , party tasks , and people &apos;s movements and their improvement .
They even went .so far as to increase friction and obstruct progress .
We have never approved of such opinions , and we hold that only through unified unity of the entire nation , striving for &apos;progress , and reliance upon the masses can we.support a protracted war and win final victory .
Otherwise , we will not be able to do so .
The Chinese Nationalist Party pointed out clearly in its program for the war of resistance and
national construction that &quot; if we are seeking certain victory in the war of resistance and certain success in national construction , we must surely rely upon the efforts of our Partyfs comrades , especially if the people of the entire country are to unite and shoulder this task together . &quot; Likewise , the Chinese Communist Party pointed out long ago that &quot; The most central task in the war of resistance is that of mobilizing all available forces to attain victory , and the key to winning victory is to develop the war of resistance that has already been launched into a total war with the entire nation participating .
Only this total war can bring final victory in the war of resistance . &quot; ( The Chinese Communist Party &apos;s resolution passed last August . ) The experience of the past 15 months has already proved that these are entirely correct .
Since the war of resistance began ^ the various classes , parties and factions , and cliques which had been in opposition to each other , have united , and the various different areas and armies have been unified .under the command of the Military Affairs Commission of the government of the Kuomintang .
Without this unity it would have been impossible to persist in the war of resistance for 15 months .
It is also because of the war of resistance that the unity of the various sides was made possible .
This kind of unity is the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front .
However , the experience of the past 15 months also made it evident to us the gravity of the enemy &apos;s schemes to sabotage and the inadequate consolidation of the unity within our ranks .
Besides objective causes , the most important reason why the war of resistance has encountered so many set @-@ backs and why we still cannot stop the enemy1s attacks and carry out our counteroffensive is that the United Front is inadequate in strength , and it has not had the necessary expansion and consolidation it must have .
It can be seen from this that the only way possible to support a protracted war and achieve final victory Is to further unify and unite the entire nation , and consolidate and expand the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front .
This is the first .
Second , the 15 months of the war of resistance has given impetus to the unification of the entire nation , but it has also shown its inadequacy .
It has impelled the progress of military affairs , politics , culture , party tasks , and people &apos;s movements and , at the same time , it has again exposed the insufficiency of this progress .
All viable forces among all class strata throughout the nation must be mobilized in order to support a protracted war and win final victory , and to achieve this objective efforts must be made so that there will be progress in all the fields of military affairs , politics , culture , party tasks , and people &apos;s movements .
If there is no greater progress made in all these respects , It will not be possible to mobilize all new forces throughout the nation and further unify and unite the entire nation .
Third , the 15 months of the war of resistance has also proved how powerful the people &apos;s assistance to the war of resistance can be .
At the same time it has also proved that the people &apos;s forces are now beginning to be mobilzied , therefore , it has caused the war of resistance to suffer many set @-@ backs because It was unable to receive the massive assistance of the people .
From this , a lesson has been learned .
The people must further understand this basic problem of the war of resistance being dependent.upon the masses .
By relying
upon the masses , all difficulties can be overcome and any powerful enemy can be defeated , but if we become separated from the masses , not a single thing can be accomplished .
Hereafter , the further progress of China must be fully manifested with respect to the mobilization of the people &apos;s forces .
In general , the only correct path to support a protracted war and wrest final victory is in consolidating and expanding the unity of the entire nation , in striving for progress so as to mobilize the new forces of the entire nation , and in relying upon the masses to overcome difficulties .
This forms our third summation .
Comrades , the basic lesson learned from the 15 months of the war of resistance is that we must.persist in the war of resistance , adhere to protracted warfare , and strive for unity and progress .
This the general policy of the war of resistance henceforth .
We can defeat the enemy if.we and the entire nation adhere to this general policy and put forth massive and protracted efforts .
The anti @-@ Japanese war of resistance is now developing toward a new stage , and there will be many new tasks , but this general program.remains unchanged .
The 15 @-@ month experience forms the basis for our observation of the new situation and it has set forth new tasks .
The New Stage of Development of the Anti @-@ Japanese War of Resistance and the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front
Policy Is Decided on the Basis of Studying the Laws Governing the War and the United Front
Comrades , after summing up past experiences , the important question will be to view the trends of the current situation .
How will the anti @-@ Japanese war of resistance and the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front proceed to transform and develop upon the basis of the past ?
This is a question we want to answer now , as it has important significance with regard to our solving the current problems .
Because , if there is no geenral estimate made on the course of transformation and development of the entire anti @-@ Japanese war of resistance , we will only be able to go around in circles with the war , permitting it to shackle us and making it impossible to place it under our own control to adjust and remold to create the necessary conditions for the war , lead it toward where we want it to go , and win final victory .
Therefore , it is necessary to know the laws governing the war of resistance against Japan in order to be able to implement the guidance of the war , and decide upon the strategies , tactics , policies , and plans which serve the purpose of the war .
It is the same with the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front .
We will be able to effectively propel the United Front onto the course of consolidation and development only by studying and understanding the laws governing its nature , and thereby permitting it to play the role of supporting pillar for victory in the war .
Let us first talk about the problem of war .
The Specifically Determined Historical Conditions and the Superiority of Subjective Capability Decide the Developmental Course of the War
Historically , wars ended after going through one stage .
For example , in the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1905 there were only the advance of the Japanese troops and the defeat and retreat of the Russians , and thereafter it ended .
It was also the same with the Italo @-@ Abyssinian war .
There were only the Italian advance and the defeat and rout of the Abyssinians before it ended .
It was also the same with China &apos;s war against the Peiyang warlords .
This is one type of situation stemming from , on the one hand , the inequality of the two sides , and on the other hand , from the difference between superior and inferior leadership which resulted in defeat .
This is one type of war .
The second type went through two stages and ended after that .
For instance , the Franco @-@ Russian war .
Napoleon went from the offensive into retreat , and the Russian from retreat to the counteroffensive .
There were two stages to both sides .
It was the same with the Ch &apos;lh Pi &#91; 6375 1084 &#93; campaign of tbe war between Wu &#91; 0702 &#93; and Wei &#91; 7614 &#93; , and the Fei Snui &#91; 3224 3055 &#93; campaign between Ch &apos;in &#91; 4440 &#93; and Chin &#91; 2516 &#93; of ancient China .
Although the comparative strength of the two .
armies was not equal , the weaker one went on the counteroffensive after retreating and defeated the enemy by being skillful in utilizing other favorable conditions and giving them correct direction .
But there is a third type of war , like the Seven Years1 War , the Eight Years &apos; War , the Thirty Years &apos; War , and the Hundred Years &apos; War of foreign countries , including the 4 @-@ year great war in Europe 20 years ago ( manifested specially on the Western Front ) , and all have three stages .
In the first stage .
A attacked and B retreated .
In the second stage , a long period of indecisive warfare .
The third stage was with B counterattacking , and A retreating .
There were also many such wars in the history of China .
The characteristic of this type of war is that there is a comparatively long , or very long period of confrontation .
This also stemmed from the specifically determined historical setting and the specific nature of the cliques directing the wars .
To which of these types does the Sino @-@ Japanese war belong ?
I hold that it belongs to the third type of war .
This stemmed from the different historical conditions and .the specific situations of the cliques directing the war .
The Protracted Nature of the Sino @-@ Japanese War Is Manifested in the Three Stages of the War
The protracted nature of the Sino @-@ Japanese war will be manifested in the three stages of the enemy &apos;s attack , holding @-@ on and retreat , and in our defense , holding @-@ on and counterattack .
The first stage of the enemy &apos;s advance and our defense emerges because of the enemy being strong and our being weak ( the enemy is in a superior position and we in the inferior , the enemy is an imperialist country and we are a semi @-@ colonial country ) .
Calling it defense instead of retreat is to say that the retreat is manifested through strategic mobil defense , that is , resisting at every step , and not an immediate pull @-@ out .
But also because of these very special conditions of the enemy being a small country , backward , and with little help , and our
being a big country , progressive , and with much support , and also because of our courageous resistance which has inflicted losses on the enemy in his attacks , through the difficulties and attrition brought about by the dispersion of his troops , the enemy has been compelled to end its strategic attacks at a definite period , and shift over to the stage of militarily defending the territories it has occupied , and attacking us politically and through economic blockade .
In this period , although the enemy has been drained , it has not yet reach the degree which would cause it to turn into defeat ; and although we have resolutely resisted in the war and made progress in many respects , we cannot , for the time being , progress to the point where it would be enough to shift over to the stage of counterattacking and driving the enemy out of the country .
Due to these factors , the second stage , or the middle stage , of stalemate is formed .
It will be possible to bring about a gradual transformation in which @-@ the original state of the enemy being strong and us weak , and the enemy in a superior position and us in an inferior one shifts to a situation which , viewed on the whole , daily becomes unfavorable to the enemy and favorable to us because of the continuing growth of the enemy &apos;s difficulties and our progress in.the second stage .
At first , balance will be reached which will turn into a superior position for us and an inferior position , for the enemy .
At this time , it will be possible to enter the third stage in which we counterattack and the enemy retreats .
The observations made on the above three stages have not yet become facts , but are possible .
It is a kind of estimate made on the entire course of the war based upon the concrete conditions of the mutually contradicting comparisons which are now in existence and those which will possibly occur in the future between the enemy and ourselves .
The possible situation can be transformed into fact only if we rely upon our subjective efforts to create the conditions necessary for such possible situations to occur .
However , such possible situations can be transformed into fact based upon existing conditions plus conducting a correct direction and the massive and resolute efforts of the entire nation .
4 , Those Advocating Quick Victory and Those Who Hold.That the Nation Will Fall Oppose Such Estimates
Those advocating a quick victory oppose the theory of three stages .
They hold the view that it is not necessary to have a middle stage for us to be able to go quickly onto the counteroffensive .
This is wrong .
The war against Japan is f.aced with many existing difficulties , and to overcome these difficulties require a definite period of time .
It is not possible to go quickly into the counteroffensive .
It is because they have , on the one hand , overly underestimated the enemy &apos;s strength , and , on the hand over @-@ estimated our own strength , that they oppose the three stages .
Those who hold the view that the nation will fall also oppose this .
They believe that it is impossible for both withstanding the enemy and going into the counteroffensive , and that China is but another Abyssinia .
This is incorrect .
They are opposite to the advocates of quick victory , over @-@ estimating the enemy &apos;s strength and under @-@ estimating our own .
Before them , there is only darkness .
They admit that the enemy can destroy all of China , and our resistance and efforts will not avail .
It is impossible to achieve the capability to withstand the enemy , let alone going into the counteroffensive and defeating the enemy .
For
this reason , we must , on the one hand oppose the quick victory theory and on the other hand oppose the theory that the nation will fall .
Only thus can we adhere to our three stage theory .
Under present circumstances , it is more important to oppose the theory that the nation will fall than quick victory @-@ ism .
There are some others who , on the surface , approve of protracted warfare , but disapprove of three stage theory .
This is also incorrect .
Where can the so @-@ called &apos; protracted warfare and drawn out war be manifested ?
In the three stages of the war .
If you accept protracted warfare and drawn out war , and yet do not approve of the three stages , then the so @-@ called protracted and drawn out war are entirely abstract things without an iota of essence and practicality .
Therefore , it will not be possible to implement any true , strategic direction , nor any factual strategic policy .
In reality , this kind of opinion still belongs to that of the quick victory theory , except that it has put on a mantle of &quot; protracted warfare . &quot;
The Relationship Between the Theory of Three Stages and the International Situation
When the Chang Kao @-@ feng &#91; 1728 7559 1496 &#93; incident.occurred , part of the opinion within the country was highly enthusiastic .
It held that if war broke out between Japan and Russia , China could go over to the counteroffensive , and a protracted war would not be necessary .
Before such a viewpoint , the theory of the three stages naturally becomes untenable , and our estimate is wrong .
This is mainly due to the idea of relying upon outside aid , and it is another form of the idea of quick victory .
However , the international situation did not develop according to the subjective wishes of these friends , but in accordance to its own laws .
The important center of the world is located in Europe , and the Orient is an important part that surrounds it .
The principal countries of the peace front in the world and the main fascist countries are in an uproar in the West over the question of the perils of war in Europe .
Regardless of whether it is on the eve of a war , or war has broken out between the big countries , the big and small nations of the West will then place the question of Europe at the head of their agenda and are reluctantly compelled to place the question of the Orient in second place .
Viewing China under such circumstances , the two stage theory of going quickly onto the counteroffensive is unreasonable .
We must mainly rely upon ourselves .
We are not afraid of the three stages , but is in the process of creating the three stages .
The three stages form the law governing the Sino @-@ Japanese war .
It has basis not only in the comparison of enemy strength and ours , but also in the International situation .
The.Stalmate Stage Is the Pivot of the War
The principal characteristic of the three stages is the inclusion of an interim transitional stage .
That is to say , first , our war of resistance must be carried out with concerted effort to stop the enemy &apos;s offensive .
If the enemy &apos;s offensive cannot be stopped at a given area and at a definite time , there will be no such thing as three different stages .
Second , it will be necessary to go all out in making preparations for all the conditions
needed to go on the offensive when the holding on stage emerges .
If this is not done , then it will not be possible to enter the counteroffensive stage .
It will be holding on forever , and the three stages become immaterial .
At this point , we positively say to those who hold the view.of quick victory that we must pass through a period of preparations before we can unite the entire nation , overcome difficulties , develop new forces , and , at the same time , coordinate these with the enemy &apos;s difficulties and international aid , and then carry out the counteroffensive and drive the enemy out of the country .
Otherwise , this will not be possible .
When problems are viewed from the standpoint of chiefly relying on our own efforts , this conclusion becomes unavoidable .
We possitively say to pessimists and those who hold the view that the nation will be lost : It is only this transitional period that is the pivotal point of the whole war .
Whether China becomes a colony or achieves liberation will be decided not by the loss of big urban areas and communications lines , but .
by the degree of effort , put out by the entire nation in the second stage .
Such losses are unfortunate , as they strengthen the enemy &apos;s forces and weaken ours , but there are still many things left which can be capitalized upon to defeat the enemy .
It will be of no avail to moan and groan over the loss of precious things .
The territories preserved during the first stage and the new , viable forces , especially the progressiveness already achieved in military affairs , politics , culture , party tasks , and people &apos;s movements , are the most valuable of all , as they form the base for the continuation of progress and preparation for the counteroffensive in the second stage .
However , these form only a base , and not a decisive factor , for counteroffensive .
The decisive factor is the force that is added on in the second stage .
Without the increase in this great , new force , counteroffensive will just be empty words .
The Characteristics of the Three Stages , the First Stage
There is a need to give a summarized explanation of the characteristics of the three stages which have already emerged , and those which can be estimated , of the anti @-@ Japanese war of resistance .
They have important ramifications with regard to the directing of the war and deciding policies .
What special traits or landmarks are there in the first stage ?
There are three aspects , which are as follows :
First , with regard to China , they are the formation of the National United Front , the bitter fighting of the entire nation &apos;s troops , the resoluteness of the war of resistance , the proclamation of the Kuomintang &apos;s program of carrying out the war of resistance and national construction , the convening of the People &apos;s Political Council , the legal status achieved by the Communist Party and other parties and factions , the advent of guerrilla warfare , the progress of all the troops in the country , and the development of people &apos;s movements .
These are all major events manifesting the progress made by China .
However , there are , at the same time , many unfavorable events and adverse phenomena .
For example , the loss of major cities , communications lines , and principal commerce and industry , the loss of territories and populations , the uneven progress of the entire country ( with some areas
progressing very slowly ) , the political system , in general , is just beginning to become democraticized , the continuing existence of obdurate conservatives and the phenomenon of corruption , the upsurge of the trend to compromise , etc .
Second . , with regard to the enemy : The drain on their military and financial resources , the censure of world opinion , the deterioration of military discipline , the corresponding weakening of the combat effectiveness of the troops , the increase of dissatisfaction among the people in its country and among the front @-@ line troops , -the failure of Chang Kao @-@ fengTs war , the difficulty of raising Chinese renegade troops and the ineffectiveness of those that have been organized .
These are major events manifesting the enemy &apos;s difficulties .
But , at the same time , there are things which show the capability of the enemy .
They are the determined nature of their offensive , the stubborn strength of its forces , the vastness of the territory it has occupied , the strength of its political organizations , and the effectiveness of its conspiratorial agencies .
Third , with regard to the international scene : The growth of the movement to aid China , and the growth of the Soviet Union1s strength and its aid to China .
All these are favorable to China but there are still other things : the brewing of a great war in Europe , the tendency toward compromise to a certain degree between Britain and Japan , the assistance given to the enemy by various countries in the form of materials for manufacturing armamentsall these are unfavorable to China .
The many things mentioned above with regard to China , Japan , and the international scene are all characteristics manifested in the 15 months of the first stage of the war of resistance .
These characteristics will effect the new stage of the future .
The Second Stage
Assuming that .
Wuhan is not to be defended , under this situation many new things will emerge from the state of the war .
Although Wuhan is occupied by the enemy , it does not mean that the old stage has ended and a new stage is beginning .
The period of time between the continuing ability of the enemy to attack and it is finally forced to stop its offensive is still the transitional period of the old stage into the new .
Although this may be so , after Wuhan is abandoned , many new situations will appear .
After Wuhan , is abandoned , as well as the greater part of the new stage , the predictable situation will be that of even more difficulties on the one hand , .and even greater progress on the other .
This is the basic characteristic of the new stage .
The increasing difficulties will be manifested as follows : 1 ) Because of the loss of major , cities and communications lines , the nation &apos;s political power and battle lines are carved up , terrain wise , and many new problems will arise from this effect ; 2 ) extreme difficulties in finance and economy ;
3 ) the tendency toward a certain degree of compromise between Britian and Japan ( or , on the contrary , the possibility of further conflict between Britain and Japan under the condition of Japan &apos;s persistance in monopolizing and threatening southeast Asia ) ; 4 ) if the enemy attacks Canton , it can be anticipated that China &apos;s sea communications routes will be cut , and international aid will temporarily drop off ; 5 ) there is the possibility of the formation of a puppet political power on a national scale and its effect on the anti @-@ Japanese front ; 6 ) the possibility of rebellion in parts of the anti @-@ Japanese frorit ^ and the upsurge of compromise atmosphere ; and 7 ) the growth of pessimism and divided opinions , etc .
These are matters which can happen and burden the anti @-@ Japanese war with new difficulties .
Only when these difficulties are taken into consideration can we overcome them in a prepared and planned manner .
Further progress will be manifested in various aspects as follows : 1 ) Generalissimo Chiang &apos;s and the Kuomintang &apos;s policy of resolutely waging a war of resistance and the further progressiveness , politically ; 2 ) improved relationships between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party , and the consolidation and expansion of the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front ; 3 ) the progressiveness of the work to reform the armies ; 4 ) the widening development of guerrilla warfare ; 5 ) the progress of democraticizing the nation ; 6 ) the even bigger development of people &apos;s movements ; 7 ) the implementation of new , wartime fiscal and economic policies ; 8 ) the elevation of cultural education of the war of resistance ; 9 ) the continuation and possible increase of aid from the Soviet Union , and the even more closer relationship between China and the Soviet Union , etc .
The entire second stage is that of stalemate .
It is the stage in which China prepares to go on the counteroffensive .
The duration of this period will be decided by the degrees of transformation in the strength of the enemy and ourselves , and what the international situation is .
But we should prepare for a long war .
After passing through this difficult course , we will arrive upon the smooth road to victory .
Although there is stalemate , strategically , in the second stage , there is still large @-@ scale warfare .
This is manifested mainly by the main forces in frontal positions standing on the defensive , while wide @-@ spread guerrilla warfare breaks out behind the enemy &apos;s lines .
At that time , in many important strategic areas , the guerrilla warfare will be fought with great difficulty , and we should begin now to make preparations to handle these difficulties .
The Third Stage
Concrete situations cannot be predicted .
But that must be the time when we have completed preparing the conditions for our counteroffensive and , at the same time , the degree of the enemy &apos;s difficulties has greatly increased and the international situation is also very much favorable to us .
At that time the war situation will no longer be strategic defense or strategic stalemate , but a strategic counteroffensive , not a strategic inner line , but a strategic
outer line .
Great progress must be made politically in country at that time , and there must be new military technology .
It will otherwise be unable to launch the counteroffensive .
Defending Wuhan Is a Question of Buying Time , and Not One of Defending It to the Last Man
The objective of the struggle to defend Wuhan is to drain the enemy on the one hand , and to buy time to enable progress of the work throughout China on the other .
And it is not to hold a position to the last man .
When the battle situation truly proves that it has become unfavorable to us and to pull out will , on the contrary , be favorable , we should follow the principle of giving up territory ; to conserve our military strength .
Therefore , a big , decisive battle which will be unfavorable to us must be avoided .
There should be no strategically decisive campaigns in either the first or second stages .
They are enough to impede the persistence in the war of resistance and the preparations for the counteroffensive , and must be avoided .
Avoiding strategically decisive battles and going all @-@ out to fight decisive combats in battles and wage campaigns under conditions favorable to us should become part of the policy for protracted warfare .
Giving up certain cities which can no longer be defended when it becomes necessary , and under definite conditions , is not only something that is forced upon us , but also a policy of luring the enemy to penetrate deeply , dispersing his forces , draining them , and sapping the enemy &apos;s enthusiasm .
Under the logical premise of not compromising and surrender but to resolutely wage a war of resistance , giving up certain points when it becomes necessary is permitted within the policy of protracted warfare , and it is not something to be frightened about .
Moving From the Current Stage to That of Stalemate
Stopping the enemy &apos;s offensive is the only way to benefit our preparations for the counteroffensive .
It still is necessary to make a big effort in order to achieve this objective .
Therefore , in transiting from the current stage to that of forcing the enemy to stop its offensive and go into defending the territories it has occupied , and the entire stage of stalemate has emerged , is still but a course of struggle , and many difficulties must be overcome in order to attain it .
This is because the enemy will not immediately conclude its offensive after Wuhan falls .
It definitely will still want to attack Sian , IchTang , Changsha , Hengchow , Wuchow , Peihai , Nanch &apos;ang , Swatow , Fuchow and adjacent &quot; areas .
We must focus on this kind of plans the enemy has and continue to use strategic mobile defense warfare if we want to stop the enemy &apos;s offensive .
We must go all out to fight resolute battles so as to drain the enemy on an even larger scale , and yet avoid being tricked by the enemy , forcing the enemy to stop its offensive , bring about a transition of the war situation to that of the enemy and ourselves into the favorable situation of stalemate .
The State of Stalemate Is Imminent
After the enemy occupies Wuhan , its weaknesses in troop strength and their dispersion will become even more pronounced .
If it still wants to attack
Sian , Ich &apos;ang , Changsha , Nanch &apos;ang , Wuchow , Fuchow , and other areas planning to occupy them , the great difficulties it has from its weakness of inadequate troop strength and its dispersion will develop to the highest degree in its offensive stage .
This is the extreme difficulty added to the enemy &apos;s phenomenon of inadequate troop strength ( it cannot possibly be adequate ) , and the dispersion of its troops ( it is compelled to spread out ) brought about by the stubborn , frontal resistance put up by our main forces and the threat of guerrilla warfare in the vast areas behind the enemy . &apos; s lines .
This situationthe enemy &apos;s inadequacy in troop strength and its dispersion , and our frontal defense and threat to the enemy &apos;s rear areasis most unfavorable to the enemy but most favorable to us .
In an overall comparison of strength between the enemy and ourselves , of course the basic situation of the enemy is strong , we are weak , and the enemy is in a superior position and we in a weak one , remains unchanged .
This change can come about only through a great effort put out by the entire nation in coordination with conditions abroad during the stage of a mutual stalemate @-@ off .
However , in the offensive campaign against Wuhan the enemy &apos;s powerful strength is further displayed .
Naturally this inflicts losses on us , but , at the same time , it creates difficulties for the enemy .
This is so because the powerful forces of the enemy ( it is , at the same time , inadequate and scattered ) , after giving further rein to its power , will deteriorate in strength , thereby compelling its overall strategic offensive to near its climax .
We adroit that the enemy &apos;s offensive still has remnants of power , and it is best , and most suitable , to estimate that this remnant.power is still considerably strong .
Therefore , there is still the possibility that the.enemy will want to attack and occupy Sian , Ich &apos;ang , Changsha , Nanch &apos;ang , Wuchow , Fuchow , and adjacent areas , and we must even be prepared for its offensive against the entire Canton @-@ Hankow line and the Sian @-@ Lanchow highway .
But , from the overall strength of the enemy , it is but a small remnant power .
From the overall national strength of Japan , it must guard against the Soviet Union in the north , the United States in the East , and the British and French in the South , while suppressing the people domestically .
It has only so much strength , and that part which can be used in China has about reached its limits .
Furthermore , in its frontal positions and in its occupied territories , the wide @-@ spread warfare , it must handle still exist .
The contradictions between Japan and the United States , Britain , and France are growing , and the contra @-@ dictions between the government and the people internally , between officers and men on the front lines , and between massive expenditures and the drying up of its finances are continuing to intensify .
All these make the enemy worry quite a bit .
We , and all the people in the country , must be able to see these , and not let the loss of major cities and communications lines to scare us .
We must approve of the support the government in rearranging the fighting all over the country , make preparations in a planned manner to give battle along the Lunghai line , the Sian @-@ Lanchow highway and other strategic areas , wage large @-@ scale guerrilla warfare behind the enemy lines , seize upon the weakness of the enemy in its inadequacy in troops and their dispersion in order to drain it even more and bring about even greater dispersion , and cause the war to move surely and victoriously into the new stage of stalemate between the enemy and ourselves .
This is the current urgent task for the entire nation .
The Enemy &apos;s Strength Is &apos;Gradually Ebbing , Our Strength Is Gradually Growing
Has the enemy &apos;s strength increased ?
From the original strength it has , there has not been much increase .
On the contrary , it has been greatly weakened .
The enemyfs original military and economic strength has been drained massively .
In the 15 months of warfare it has sustained casualties of several hundred thousand troops , used up a huge quantity of weapons and ammunition , as well as military supplies , over a hundred warships and several hundred planes have been destroyed , and it has expended several hundred.million yen .
This drain is unprecedented in the history of Japan .
Until it has been forced to stop its strategic offensive , a great part of its strength will be drained .
Its ally , Hitler , has been greatly worried over this for a long time .
But is there no increase at all in the enemy &apos;s strength ?
There is , and this is so because of its occupation of China &apos;s principal cities , communications lines , and part of the rural areas .
It has seized the market from the various countries and from Chinese national capital , raw material sources and tools of production from China , and much manpower .
These constitute the only objective of Japan &apos;s war , and it has been increased in such things temporarily .
But the question is can these things withstand the drain of war ?
They cannot .
The entire &quot; investment &quot; of the war has been drained off and will remain so .
If it seeks returns , it must put in new production .investments.
Again , the question is can it get returns to make up for tbe drain of war from its production investments , disregarding the ineffectiveness of its investments and assuming that they are effective ?
Again no .
Because in its rear a widespread war still exists , and the daily drain continues .
So long as there is a wide @-@ spread guerrilla war in the enemy &apos;s rear , such as the guerrilla warfare in North China , it will be very difficult for the enemy to get anything out of it .
Because of the continuous warfare , not only will it be impossible to get returns from its old investments , it will have to put in new ones .
If we only persist in this war of resistance the pitiful fate of Japan is certain .
We have said that in the second strategic stage , that is , the stalemate stage , Japan will gradually change from strength to weakness , from a superior to an inferior position .
This kind , of continuous drain is the deciding factor .
We will now talk with respect to China .
Has China &apos;s strength been weakened , or has it been increased ?
Our answer is that it has been weakened and it has increased .
What has decreased is the quality and quantity of its original strength .
This is manifested in the drain on weapons and personnel of the troops , in the loss of population , industry , territory , and natural resources .
This is an important aspect of what is making us feel difficult .
However , it is not that there has been no increase .
What has increased is the new quality and quantity .
This is manifested in the unity of the entire nation , the improvements made in military forces , politics , and culture , and in the enhancement o the degree of consciousness among the people and their organization .
Although the main force has retreated , guerrilla warfare has advanced .
Although a part of the territory has been lost , another part has improved .
The question is that the degree of increase attained today is not enough to stop the enemy &apos;s offensive , and , later , it will even be more inadequate to carry out our counteroffensive .
Therefore , it has created the problem of the necessity to apply a massive , prolonged effort to increase new strength .
This kind of increasethat is , the mobilization on an even greater scale of the new and viable forces among the various stratum of the people of the nation and the even greater improvement in the various fields of party , politics , military , and civiliansto be based upon a wide @-@ spread and prolonged effort hereafter is entirely possible .
In mainly relying upon the forces produced by ourselves , and in coordination with the increased difficulties of the enemy and the strengthening of international aid to us , it will enable the transformation of the situation between the enemy and ourselves to take place .
To go from the present situation of the enemy being in a superior and our being in inferior position first to that of equal balance , and then to our being in a superior , and the enemy in an inferior position .
This is the basic problem in the protracted mutually holding @-@ off stage which must be , and can be , resolved .
The Enemy Holds the Cities , We the Rural Areas , Therefore the War Is a Long , Drawn @-@ out One .
But the Rural Areas Can Eventually Overcome the Cities
Therefore , the problem is : after the enemy occupied China &apos;s major cities and communications lines , it holds the cities to deal with us while we hold the rural areas to deal with them , and can the rural areas be victorious over the cities ?
The answer is : there will be difficulties , but it is possible .
The protracted nature of the anti @-@ Japanese war of resistance is brought about not only because we are a semi @-@ colonial country and the enemy is an imperialist nation , but also because this imperialism also occupied our cities , and we have to retreat to the rural areas to resist the enemy .
On this point , the theory of quick victory has no basis at all .
But the problem of China &apos;s cities and rural areas is distinct in nature from those of the foreign capitalist countries .
In the capitalist countries the cities in form and in practicality dominate the rural areas .
When the headthe citiesis lopped off , the limbsthe rural areascannot survive .
It is inconceivable that in countries like Britain , the United States , France , Germany , Japan , and Italy a long , rural peasant war against the cities is possible .
It is also impossible in small , semi @-@ colonial countries .
Several decades ago , it would also be very difficult for a big , semi @-@ colonial country like China .
But today , this possibility has developed in a big , semi @-@ colonial country like China .
In this it is obvious that there are the 3 three @-@ in @-@ one conditions .
First is the semi @-@ colonial condition .
In a semi @-@ colonial country , the cities , although essentially in a leading position , cannot completely control the rural areas .
This is because the cities are too small and the rural areas too vast , and the large supply of manpower and material is in the rural areas , not in the cities .
Second is the condition of a big country .
A part of it is lost but another part remains .
The enemy encounters a big country with few troops .
When our strong and resolute resistance is added to this , it forces the creation of the difficulties of inadequate troops and their dispersion .
In this way it
has not only given us a general base for resisting Japanthat is the vast rear areas like Yunnan , Kweichow , Szechwan and other areas @-@ it has made it impossible for the enemy to occupy ; also , a vast area for guerrilla activities has been provided us behind the enemy &apos;s lines , such as North , Central , and South China and other areas , thereby making it impossible for the enemy to occupy all of the territories .
Third is the condition of today .
If China had been occupied by a big imperialist country by force of arms , as in the case of BritainTs occupation of India , several decades ago , it would be difficult to avoid becoming a colony .
But today it is different .
Today , of primary importance is that China has progressed .
It has a new political party , army , and people , and these form the basic strength for defeating the enemy .
Hext is that the enemy has retrogressed .
The developmental course of imperialist JapanTs social economy has reached the stage of senility .
The growth of capitalism in Japan has created , and is creating , conditions that will send it to its own grave .
In addition , the international situation has changed .
The old world is nearing death and annihilation and a new world is dawning .
I have spoken in detail.on these reasons in my article &quot; On Protracted War . &quot; In brief , in today &apos;s semi @-@ colonial big country like China , there exist many conditions which are favorable to our organizing a resolutely fought , protracted and large @-@ scale war to oppose the enemy occupying the cities .
Surrounding and isolating the cities with interlocking warfare , gradually fostering the growth of our own forces in .
a protracted war , transforming the situation between the enemy and ourselves , and coordinating with the changes in the world , will enable us to drive out the enemy and recover the cities .
It is beyond doubt that in today &apos;s China it is also difficult for the rural areas to oppose the cities because the cities are always concentrated while the rural areas are dispersed .
After the enemy occupied our major cities , our administrative areas and battle lines were carved up topographically , thereby bringing many difficulties upon us .
This decided the protracted and merciless nature of the anti @-@ Japanese war of resistance .
However , it is necessary for us to say that for the rural areas to be able to defeat the cities , it is because it has the above mentioned three @-@ ih @-@ one conditions .
Under conditions of civil war , a very small portion of the rural areas supported a long war of opposition against the cities , and that was at a time when the imperialist countries were as one in opposition to communism .
Who can say that under the condition pf national war , and also in a period when the imperialist camp is split , China , with its greater .part of the rural areas , cannot support a protracted war to oppose the enemy in the cities ?
There is no doubt that it is possible .
Furthermore , the present so @-@ called rural areas are greatly different from that of the civil war period .
Its territory is not only huge , but in the vast rear areas of Yunnan , Kweichow , and Szechwan provinces , there still are many cities and industries open to the outside , and still can carry out construction .
On the basis of the preservation of the broad , rear areas and establishing guerrilla warfare bases behind enemy lines , and fostering- the growth of our forces and weakening the enemy &apos;s , which , together with future favorable conditions on the international scene , will enable us to launch our counteroffensive and recover the cities .
In his letter to the
people last December , Generalissimo Chiang pointed out : &quot; The core of achieving final victory in China &apos;s protracted war does not lie in Hanking , nor in the various big cities .
In reality , it is dependent upon the rural areas of the entire country and the powerful and stubborn will of the people . &quot; This is entirely correct .
Although the war is difficult , a victorious future still exis ts .
The Peril of Compromise Exists .
Overpoweringly , But It Can Be Overcome
Long ago , we said that part of those inflicted with the disease of fearing the Japanese often attempted to shake the government &apos;s determination to wage a war of resistance .
They proposed the so @-@ called peaceful compromise , and this was seen in the past after Nanking fell .
Now , it is again fomenting .
This is a reflection of the enemy &apos;s plots within the anti @-@ Japanese front .
This kind of peril exist in serious preponderance , and the people must give full attention to it so that the pro @-@ Japanese faction will not be able to get its traitorous way .
The plans of the pro @-@ Japanese faction and that of the enemy is in accord .
It will surely concentrate on opposition to Chiang and the Communist Party , and foist its treachery under false orders .
This will cause the future of the war of resistance become doubtful .
Therefore , the entire country has been aroused and is aware of the fact that the enemy &apos;s schemes and the sowing of discontent within our ranks are frightening .
They must take the initiative to consciously strive to oppose this kind of plot without slackening its effort for the least bit .
Is this kind of peril possible to be overcome ?
It is .
After the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have become united as one with all patriots and put out the necessary effort , it is not only imperative , but also completely possible to overcome this peril of compromise , drive out and eliminate the devils who openly aided the enemy , and persist in the war of resistance .
This is because the pro @-@ Japanese , after all , does not have too much power , while that of the anti- ^ Japanese faction is greater than the pro @-@ Japanese .
The New State of the Guerrilla Warfare in the Stalemate Stage
In the new stage , the frontal defense is the main force , and the guerrilla warfare behind the enemy &apos;s lines will become , for a while , the principal form of warfare .
But the guerrilla war in the enemy &apos;s rear during the stalemate stage will adopt a type of new state to develop .
What is this new state of the guerrilla warfare ?
It is , firstly , the ability to develop extensively in the vast areas .
This is because the territory is huge on our side , while on the enemy side its troops are inadequate and dispersed .
If only we can adhere to the policy of expanding the guerrilla war and give it correct leadership , it will be impossible for the enemy to completely stop our expansion .
Secondly , in some important strategic areas , such as North China and the lower basin of the Yangtze River , we will encounter ruthless enemy attacks and it will become impossible to maintain big army corps in the plains areas .
The mountain areas will become the main bases , and.guerrilla troops in some areas will possibly have to cut back in numbers .
We must prepare now for the coming of this state of affairs .
Currently , in order to coordinate with the fighting of the main forces and prepare for the transition to a .
new stage , we should ,
in general , separate the guerrilla warfare behind the enemy &apos;s lines into two types of areas .
One type is the areas where guerrilla warfare has been fully expanded , such as North China .
The principal policy here is to consolidate the foundation already established , so as to make preparations which will enable us to defeat the enemy &apos;s ruthless offensives in the new stage and hold on to our bases ..
Another type is the areas where guerrilla warfare has not been fully expanded , or are now beginning to be expanded , such as in the areas of central China .
The principal policy here is to rapidly develop guerrilla warfare in order to avoid having difficulties with the expansion of guerrilla warfare with the return of the enemy &apos;s troops .
In the future , in order to coordinate with the main force manning the frontal defenses so that it will have an opportunity to rest and regroup , and to develop forces in preparation for the counteroffensive , we must put all our efforts into the guerrilla war resolutely defending the bases .
In the protracted period of persistence , train the guerrilla troops into a new force to enmesh the enemy and aid the frontal positions .
Generally speaking , the guerrilla warfare behind the enemy &apos;s lines in the new stage will be much more difficult than in the preceding stage .
We must foresee such difficulties and accept them .
We must not become confused just because it was easy to expand in the preceding stage , because the enemy will definitely turn around to attack the guerrilla war .
However , it is still possible to persist in it , and all leaders of the work being done behind the enemy &apos;s rear must have this confidence .
This is because the guerrilla warfare in the national war of resistance , regardless of how powerful the enemy is , is much superior than under the condition of civil war .
To win over and collapse the puppet forces so as to isolate the Japanese , is , at this point , an extremely important task .
The New Stage of Development of the Anti @-@ Japanese War of Resistance Is , At the Same .
Time , the New Stage of Development of the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front
The above.are problems all concerned with the state of affairs of the anti @-@ Japanese war of resistance , and the following will concern the state of affairs of the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front .
The time when the anti @-@ Japanese war of resistance has developed into a new stage is the time when the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front has done the same .
Because there will be even more difficulties to be encountered in the new stage , the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front , in accordance with this kind of situation , should display its might in the struggle against difficulties and overcome any kind of difficulties against which it is pitted .
So that the Chinese Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front can display that it has the power to overcome difficulties , and not its inability , in the current transitional stage and upon entering the new stage in the future , it must earnestly consolidate and expand the United Front .
A long @-@ term war can be supported only by a long @-@ ternj united front .
The protracted nature of the war and that of the National United Front are inseparable .
The Kuomintang Has a Bright Future
The Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front has the Kuomintang and the Communist Party for its base , and of these two the Kuomintang is the first big party .
The development and adherence.to the war of resistance cannot be imagined separate from the Kuomintang .
The Kuoraintang has its glorious history .
Of primary importance is the overthrow of the Ch &apos;ing dynasty , the founding of a republic , the opposition to Yuan Shih @-@ k &apos;ai , the establishment of a policy of unification with the Soviet Union , with the Communist Party , as well as a worker @-@ peasant policy , and the carrying out of the great revolution of the 15th and 16th year after the founding of the republic .
Today , it is again leading the great war of resistance against Japan .
It has a historical tradition of the Three People &apos;s Principles , it has two great leaders , Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen and Chiang Kai @-@ shek , one following the other , and it has a broad mass of loyal and patriotic party members .
All these must not be ignored by the people .
All these are the results of the development of China &apos;s history .
In the course of carrying out the war of resistance against Japan and in the forming of the Anti @-@ Japanese National.-United Front , the Kuomintang stood in the position of leadership .
In the past 15 months , the various anti @-@ Japanese parties and factions have seen improvement , and the progress of the Kuomintang was very clear .
It convened the provisional congress , proclaimed the program for the war of resistance , convened the People * s Political Council , began the organization of the Three People &apos;s Principles Youth League , accepted the legal existence of the various parties and factions to resist Japan and carry out national construction together , implemented to a certain degree democratic power , carried out reforms in the military and in political organizations , made foreign policy compatible with the demands of opposition against Japan , and others , all of which are major events of historical significance .
Based solely on the premise of persisting in the war of resistance and in the United Front , it can be predicted that the Kuomintang &apos;s future will be bright .
However , up to now , there are still quite a few people harboring an incorrect observation of the Kuomintang , and they doubt its future .
The doubt they hold is the problem of whether it can continue to wage the war of resistance , whether it can continue to progress , and whether it can become an ally for opposing Japan and national construction .
Furthermore , these problems are mutually connected and inseparable .
What is our opinion on this ?
We hold that the Kuomintang has a bright future .
On the basis of various subjective and objective conditions , it is able to continue with the war of resistance , continue to progress , and become an ally for opposing Japan and national construction .
Because of the determined nature of the enemy &apos;s offensive , the severe blows dealt by the enemy to the various class strata of China and its plunder , the anger of the troops throughout China against the enemy and their courageous war of resistance , the upsurge of the anti @-@ Japanese movement throughout China , the existence of a favorable state of affairs on the international sceneall these facts have basically decided the political direction of the Kuomintang and
the entire country .
First , any party or faction , including the Kuomintang , the Communist Party , and other anti @-@ Japanese political parties and organizations , must continue to wage the war of resistance .
Whoever does not do so has only one way out , and that is to become a traitor .
There is no other way .
Second , any party or faction , if it only continues to wage the war of resistance , must progress .
It is beyond doubt that the progress of domestic politics is not rapid and not .
on a general scale , therefore , it brought about the damage wrought by war .
But it is also because of such loss that will compel it to seek progress in politics , military affairs , culture , party tasks , and people &apos;s movements so as to enable it to resist the enemy and recover lost territory .
Regardless of whether it is the Kuomintang that is in power , or any other party or faction , they must all continue to make progress .
Third , , an important link in the progress made domestically is the democratici @-@ gation of the organizational form of the Kuomintang .
It has caused itself to become an alliance for resisting Japan and for national construction , and the best organizational form for the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front .
Is there such a possibility ?
I believe there is .
If the Kuomintang does not , in accordance with the trend of the situation of the war of resistance , open its doors to the masses and hold in one great organization the patriotic parties and factions and patriots of the entire nation , it will be impossible for it to shoulder the difficult task of continuing the war of resistance and defeat the enemy .
In its 50 @-@ year history , the Kuomintang , whenever it encountered a great revolutionary struggle , always transformed itself into an alliance of national revolution .
There were two occasions when this happened which were most prominent and had historical significance .
The first time was from the formation of the T &apos;ung @-@ meng Hui &#91; 0681 4147 2585 &#93; to the Hsin Hai &#91; 6580 0075 &#93; revolution .
With the objective to oppose the Ch &apos;ing dynasty and establish a republic , Dr.
Sun Yat @-@ sen formed an alliance with all revolutionary parties and factions ( from the Kuang @-@ fu Hui &#91; 0342 1788 2585 &#93; to the Kelau Hui &#91; 0766 5071 2585 &#93; .
During this period , annals of heroic struggles filled the party roster .
It went from victory to victory , enriched with vigor and , therefore , was successful in its Hsin Hai revolution .
The second time was from the 13th to the 16th years after the founding of the republic .
With opposition to imperialism and the warlords as the objective , an alliance was made , domestically , with the workers , peasants , and the Communist Party , arid , abroad , it formed an alliance with the socialist country of the Soviet Union , and established the famous &quot; Three Great Policies . &quot; Because of this , the Whampoa Military Academy was established , a party army was formed , and victory was won in the Northern Expedition .
All these not only manifested the development of the KuomintangTs United Front , but also that of the Three People &apos;s Principles .
Today is the moment for the Kuomintang to become a revolutionary national alliance for the third time in its history .
It is not only possible but imperative , for it to transform itself into a national alliance for opposing Japan and national construction for the purpose of opposing imperialist Japan and establishing a republic based upon the Three People &apos;s Principles .
This great movement is already beginning to unfold .
Ey accepting the legal status of the Communist Party and other parties and factions , by accepting the Eighth Route Army into the people &apos;s revolutionary army system , by its clear announcement in its program for war of resistance and national construction in which it declared &quot; if we are seeking certain victory in the war of resistance and certain success in national construction , we must rely upon the
efforts of our Party1s comrades and the people of the entire country to unite and shoulder this task together , &quot; as well as the convening of the People &apos;s Political Council and the organization of the Three PeopleTs Principles Youth League , the Ruomintang has indicated the beginning of a transformation of itself into a national alliance for opposing Japan and national construction .
The current problem is : what kind of attitude should the Communist Party take with regard to this movement of the Kuomintang to expand its organization ?
Should we.approve or oppose ?
We say we approve the KuomintangTs expansion and development of itself into a national revolutionary alliance at any time .
When the Kuomintang reorganized in the 13th year after the founding of the republic , we adopted an attitude of approval .
We shall go all out to approve and support it today when the national peril is extremely grave .
The reason is that the bigger the anti @-@ Japanese allied armies are , the better it will be .
It is not enough to beat back imperialist Japan with only the development and progress of the Communist Party .
Although the second place Communist Party of China has initiated and adhered to the United Front of all parties , factions , and armies , as well as opening the doors of its own organization to the broad masses of revolutionary comrades in a drive to achieve victory in opposing Japan , it will be extremely harmful to the United Front and the war of resistance if the first place Kuomintang continues to preserve the old state of affairs .
The war @-@ of resistance cannot be won , the entire nation will be in peril , and the Communist Party and the proletariat will not be able to escape this kind of danger .
Therefore , not only does the Communist Party not oppose , but also very much hope for and resolutely approve and support the Kuomintang &apos;s expanding and consolidating its organization , implementing democraticization within its party , and bring about its own transformation into a revolutionary national alliance to benefit the continuation of the war of resistance and winning final victory .
But There Still Are Obstacles Ahead for the Kuomintang , and Strong Efforts Must Be Made To Overcome Them Before the Kuomintang Can Develop
A bright future for the Kuomintang exists , and its progress and development are possible .
Chiang Kai @-@ shek and the majority of the Kuomintang are leading and propelling the Kuomintang forward .
But , it is known to every one that there are some conservatives still in the Kuomintang , impeding the speed and degree of the Kuomintang &apos;s progress .
Because of their existence , and their union with many conservatives in society , they form a counter @-@ current in the flood of the national revolutionary war , stubbornly resisting the ship of progress .
It has , with considerable strength , hindered the democraticization of the country , the implementation of all progressive enterprises necessary to the war of resistance , .the carrying out of the many good policies and methods contained in the repeated proclamations , talks , speeches , and orders of Chiang Kai @-@ shek , the implementation of the Kuomintang &apos;s program of war of resistance and national construction and the Kuomintang &apos;s orders for national salvation , and the development of mass movements .
These are all facts , and they are important reasons for the Kuoraintang &apos;s progress being slow and not wide @-@ spread , and for the harm inflicted upon the war of resistance .
They oppose the progress and development of the Kuomintang , and even went to the extent of proposing compromise .
If these fellows were to get the upper hand , then ChinaTs national liberation enterprise would receive great setbacks .
Therefore , it is worth paying great attention to them .
However , we firmly believe that such conservative influence cannot exist forever .
It will be difficult for it to get .
the upper hand although it has not , and they are not the main stream , but an adverse current .
Under the leadership of Generalissimo Chiang , and with the endeavors of the majority of the Kuoinintang and the approval and support of the people of the entire nation , this kind of conservative trend can be overcome .
The Communist Party resolutely support the progress of the Kuomintang , and hope that the conservatives , who are obstructing progress , will turn over a new leaf and seek progress together .
We hope that these people will change .
&quot; A gentleman &apos;s impropriety are like the eclipses , &quot; everything will be all right if they reform .
In reality we have seen many conservatives making progress in the course of the war of resistance , and , henceforth , there inevitably will be many people attaining consciousness through the lessons learned from the war of resistance and make progress together with the masses .
This is the refonnable nature of the conservatives in the anti @-@ Japanese war .
But there also is the possibility that some may become even worse , willingly allowing themselves to be swept away by the huge wave of the war of resistance .
And this is another side of the changeable nature .
With regard to this kind of people it is of no loss to us .
Other Parties and Factions Also Have a Bright Future
All the parties and factions participating in the anti @-@ Japanese war and the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front , based upon the premise of persisting in the war of resistance and the United Front , all have a future for development .
We are willing to establish long @-@ term cooperation with them , and also give them all possible approval and support .
This is the same for all regardless of whether it is a third party , the national youth party , national socialist party , national salvation association faction , or any other groups , parties , or factions .
It is very obvious that the so @-@ called bright future for all parties and factions on the premise of persisting in the war of resistance and adhering to the United Front encompasses the efforts made within the parties of the trend toward conservatism .
If there is such a trend which will be harmful to the war of resistance and the United Front , and it is allowed to develop unchecked , there will then be the danger of destroying its bright future .
Regardless of whether it is the Kuomintang , the Communist &apos; Party , or other parties and factions , it will be the same for all , and full attention must be given to this problem .
The Characteristics of the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front of China
Because of China &apos;s historical causes , it has made today &apos;s Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front of China different from any united fronts of foreign countries , like the popular front , nor is it like the united fronts in China &apos;s history , such as the first cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party .
This is the reason why there is the special characteristics of today &apos;s China .
Recognizing these characteristics has great significance with regard to the consolidation and expansion of the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front .
What are these characteristics ?
The conclusion is that there are eight characteristics .
They are those of national opposition against Japan , of the protracted nature , of imbalance , of the armies , of the experience gained from the 15 months , of the majority of the people still lacking organization , of the Three People &apos;s Principles , and of the new international situation .
First of all , it is that of the opposition against Japan by the entire nation .
This characteristic has defined the basic nature of our United Front .
On the one hand it is for the purpose of opposing imperialist Japan , a foreign nation which has invaded our nation &apos;s territory , that our United Front was formed and developed .
On the other hand , the organizational , elements include the various different parties and factions of the entire nation , different classes , different armies , and different nationalities , forming into &apos;one of the largest groups .
The organizational elements can be so big because it is for the purpose of opposing the aggression of a foreign nation .
Because of its colossal size , this United Front has immense power .
But at the same time , many mutual frictions within the United Front are difficult to avoid , and they must suitably be adjusted .
Only thus can the objective of uniting to oppose the outsiders be attained .
This kind of most basic characteristics of our United Frontthe political objective of opposing aggression by a foreign nation and the extreme massiveness of the organizational elements are different from the popular fronts of France and Spain .
It is also different from the national , front of the first great revolution period ( the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party ) .
It has brought about the production of many specific contents and specific results in the United Front of today .
This is the first characteristic and strong point of today &apos;s United Front , although , at the same time , it is unavoidable to have weaknesses with respect to the complexity of its organization .
Second is its long @-@ term nature .
This characteristic is an outcropping of the first .
Because this United Front utilizes national warfare to oppose Japanese imperialism , and Japanese imperialism is a powerful imperialism , it therefore , gave birth to the long @-@ term nature of the anti @-@ Japanese war and , in its turn , produces the long @-@ term nature of the United Front .
This will be brought up in the 5th part of my report .
It is the starting point for all policies .
In this regard it is also different from the first cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party .
The third is imbalance .
Because of historical causes , it has brought about an imbalance in the political power of the various parties , factions , and classes .
At the same time , this kind of imbalance is also manifested in the distribution of areas .
The Kuomintang is the first big party with real power , the Communist Party is second , and the others follow behind .
This situation has brought forth many specific things .
The fourth is the nature of the armies .
The Kuomintang and the Communist Party both have armiesthis result of specific historical conditions is not a weakness , but a strong point .
Because of the armies of the two parties , they have been able to discharge all of the best responsibilities of division of labor in the course of the war against Japan , and the benefits of mutual
emulation and encouragement also became more numerous .
In this respect , it
is similar to that of Spain , but different from that o France as well as
the first cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party .
This
is also one of the factors which made long @-@ term cooperation between the Kuomintang
and the Communist Party possible .
Fifth is that of the 15 months &apos; experience .
The period from 1924 to 1927 is the 4 years of the first cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party .
The period from 1927 to 1936 is the 9 years of division between them .
Now , the new @-@ cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has lasted for 2 years .
The experience of the cooperation @-@ division @-@ new @-@ cooperation of the past 15 years has taught a most profound lesson to the Kuomintang and the Communist Party , as well as to other parties and factionss and to the people of the entire nation .
The conclusion is that there only should be cooperation , not division .
This is also one of the foundations for long @-@ term cooperation .
This valuable experience is not available to other countries of the world , and it was also unavailable during the first cooperation between the two parties .
Sixth is that of the majority of the masses being without an organization .
This is a characteristic of China , and the various foreign countries are different from this .
Therefore , it is a shortcoming which made the United Front lacking an existing and organized people &apos;s base .
But at the same time , the various parties can divide the labor among themselves to organize the masses .
It is not necessary for them to crowd together in one place in perpetual friction , because you can find everywhere masses without organizations and are waiting to be organized to meet the urgent need of the war of resistance .
Seventh is that of the Three PeopleTs Principles .
The Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front &quot; has the Three People &apos;s Principles for its base .
It is a base not only for cooperating to oppose Japan , but also for cooperation in national construction .
The nationalism of the Three People &apos;s Principles will lead this cooperation to wresting national liberation , people &apos;s power will lead this cooperation to thoroughly establish a democratic country , and the people &apos;s livelihood will , even more possibly , lead this cooperation into a very long @-@ term affair .
The political program and political ideology of the Three People &apos;s Principles ensures the long @-@ term nature of the United Front .
Eighth is that of being in a new , international situation .
The political and economic conditions of today &apos;s world is different from both periods of the first cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and the subsequent division .
Today , only a portion of the imperialist countries like Germany , Italy , and Japan oppose Kuomintang @-@ Communist Party cooperation and the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front .
Another portion of the imperialist countries , because of the contradictions between them and Japan , also do not oppose our United Front for the present , but , on the contrary , they take a stand of approval .
All of the progressive people of all the countries support us .
The Soviet Union supports us sincerely .
This kind of a new international situation has very important impact upon our long @-@ term cooperation .
It will be possible to adopt a suitable policy politically and in the attitude toward work only through intense study and understanding of the aforesaid characteristics .
Political problems and work problems cannot be handled in the manner of treating the symptoms and not the cause , but problems should be resolved correctly on the basis of a scientific foundation .
The victory in the anti @-@ Japanese war and the consolidation and expansion of the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front require this type of scientific foundation .
The New Situation of the United Front
The Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front must appear with a new posture in the new stage of the war against Japan so as to be able to handle the new situation of the war .
This new posture is the wide @-@ scale development and high degree of consolidation of the United Front .
The lesson of the 15 months of unity and war of resistance will stimulate various parties to understand the necessity for this kind of consolidation and development .
With regard to development , it is the enlargement of the Party &apos;s organization and the expansion of people &apos;s organizations .
As for consolidation , the various parties are to adopt new policies and new work , diminish mutual friction , and achieve a truly sincere unity to meet the national peril .
There are many difficulties in the new stage of the war of resistance .
It is only through the large @-@ scale development of the organizations of the various parties in the United Front and consolidation to a high degree the inner relationships of the various parties , as well as the relationships between the various parties , that the new political tasks can be carried out with vigor , difficulties overcome and the objective of stopping the enemy &apos;s offensive and preparing for our counteroffensive attained .
This is the new state of affairs of the United Front in the new state of the anti @-@ Japanese var .
Through the concerted effort of the various parties and the enthusiastic support of the people throughout the country , it will be entirely possible for this kind of new state to emerge .
The Current Urgent Task for the Entire Nation
In accordance with the summation made in the past on the war of resistance and the estimates of the development of a new stage in the United Front , what should be the current , urgent task for the entire nation ?
What differences should there be with that of the past ?
In general , the task should be persisting in the war of resistance and in protracted warfare , consolidating and expanding the United Front so as to overcome difficulties , stop the enemyTs offensive , prepare our forces , carry out our counteroffensive , and achieved the objective of finally driving out the enemy .
Specifically speaking , there are the following concrete tasks .
All organizational elements of the Antir @-@ Japanese National United Front should support the government ..
Furthermore , they must , under the leadership of the government carry out the mobilization of the entire nation .
Communist Party members should be models in the implementation of these tasks .
Rouse To a High Degree National Self @-@ Respect and Confidence , Persist to the End With the War of Resistance , and Oppose Attempts at Compromise
It is estimated that there will develop and grow , among part of the people , a mood of pessimism and hopelessness regarding the future of the war of resistance , &quot; because of the loss of major cities and communications , difficulties in finance and economy , and the untimeliness of international aid .
The Japanese , traitors , and pro @-@ Japanese factions will definitely take advantage of this mood to vigorously fan up an atmosphere of compromise in an attempt to shake our determination to wage the war of resistance .
Therefore , the first task of the entire nation is to rouse to a high degree national self @-@ respect and confidence , overcome the pessimistic mood of some of the people , resolutely support the government in continuing with the policy of resistance , oppose any plans to surrender and compromise , and persist to the end with the war of resistance .
This task has become more important than in any other periods of the past .
With this as the objective , we must mobilize newspapers , periodicals , schools , propaganda groups , culture and arts groups , military and political organizations , people &apos;s organizations , and all other possible forces and carry out wide @-@ spread propaganda and encouragement among the officers and men on the front lines , rear echelon troops on guard , the people of the lost territories , and the masses of the entire country .
We must carry out this policy in a resolute and planned manner , advocate waging the war of resistance to the end , oppose surrender and compromise , and purge the mood of despair .
We must repeatedly point out the possibility and inevitability of final victory , that compromise means death , and the way out lies only in the war of resistance .
We must call upon the entire nation to unite and not to fear difficulties , nor sacrifices .
We definitely will have freedom , we definitely will win .
We must utilize these to achieve the objective of the entire country continuing with the war of resistance in one accord .
For this purpose , all propaganda and encouragement must take the following aspects under consideration .
In one respect we must utilize national revolutionary models which have emerged and are in the.process of emerging ( such as courageous resistance in the war and sacrificing oneself for the country , P &apos;inghsingkuan , T &apos;aierchuang , the 800 heroes , the advance of guerrilla warfare , the generous contribution of money , the patriotism of the overseas Chinese , and others ) and propagate widely to the front lines and the rear areas , domestically and internationally .
In another respect we must expose , purge , and eliminate the negative factors that exist , and are growing , in the national front ( compromise tendencies , moods of despair , phenomena of corruption , and others ) .
In still another respect we must announce to the entire country concrete facts concerning all of the enemyTs cruel and inhuman acts and make accusations to the world in order to achieve the objective of enhancing national consciousness and rousing national self @-@ respect and self @-@ confidence .
We must know that the inadequacy of such consciousness and self @-@ confidence is greatly hampering the tasks ofp overcoming difficulties and preparing for the counteroffensive .
Support Generalissimo Chiang , the Nationalist Government , and the Cooperation Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party , and Oppose Separation and Division and Any Puppet Governments
In the new situation the enemy &apos;s policy will inevitably concentrate upon opposing Chiang and the Communist Party , and establishing a puppet government on a national scale in an attempt to topple Generalissimo Chiang and the nationalist.government , and sabotage the cooperation and unity of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party .
With the focus on this enemy policy , the second task for the entire nation will be to call upon the whole country to act in complete accord and sincerely support Generalissimo Chiang , the nationalist government , the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party , and the unification of the whole country , and oppose any enemy action which will be harmful to them and any puppet government ruling China .
For this purpose we must adjust the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party , between the central government and the local areas , between the various armies participating in the war of resistance , and between the government and the people .
In these relationships , advocate a fair and reasonable spirit of mutual love and cooperation , reduce friction and divided opinions , and oppose action which utilizes difficulties to create trouble for the government .
We must call &apos; .upon the entire country to give serious attention to the enemy &apos;s , traitors &apos; , and pro @-@ Japanese factions1 evil plot to sow dissension in our.ranks and create dissatisfaction and division .
We must prevent any unfavorable impact upon the prestige of Generalissimo Chiang and the nationalist government ; we must create an ever @-@ growing intimacy in the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and the unity of the entire nation , and establish a solid core of continuing to wage the war of resistance in difficult circumstances , and we must use them to oppose the enemy and the puppet government , overcome difficulties , and prepare for the counteroffensive .
Strengthen the Combat Effectiveness of the Main Force , Defend Central , Southern , and Southwest China , and Halt the Enemy &apos;s Offensive
Focusing on the enemy &apos;s current attack on Wuhan and his plans to continue its attack on southern and southwest China , the third task for the nation is to heighten the combat effectiveness of the main force , reorganize existing troops , and increase organization of new troops for the purpose of defending central , southern , and southwest China andtstopping the enemy &apos;s offensives .
With respect to the Chinese main force , it must , for this purpose , first develop a high level of mobile warfare .
At the same time support it with necessary and possible line defense , oppose the enemy at every step and drain its effective strength ..
Second , it must establish in the vast rear areas those military factories that are possible to construct , and also enhance their manufacturing capability to support the front lines with weapons and ammunition .
Third , it must carry out the national revolutionary political work conscientiously among its troops , the education in politics , culture , and entertainment , and enhance the spirit of courageous struggle and prolonged and arduous combat throughout its forces .
Fourth , it must improve the
life of the enlisted men on the basis of materials on hand , organize economic committees in the companies , and let the soldiers control the food .
Fifth , it must promote conscious discipline , abolish the system of cursing and striking , and advocate friendliness and unity between the officers and men in order to improve their relationship .
Sixth , it must implement selling and buying publicly , treat people with friendliness , abstain from coercive levy of food grains and conscripting transportation labor and soldiers by force , and change to the method of political mobilization to resolve the problems of transportation labor and new soldiers so as to improve relations between the military and the civilians .
Seventh , enhance the spirit of friendliness and mutual aid between the various armies on the front lines and between the front line armies and the rear area armies , aiding each other in battle and emulating each other in work . , and eliminate the bad phenomena &apos; of watching each other and be envious of each other so as to improve the relationship between the various armies .
Eighth , reorganize existing troops and make up for the shortages while , at the same time , organizing additional new troops and intensifying their education and training in order to put them in an advantageous position for prolonged combat .
Utilize all these methods to enhance the combat effectiveness of the main force for fighting in defense of central , southern , and southwest China and for struggling to stop the enemy &apos;s offensives and prepare for our counteroffensive .
Expand on a Large Scale Guerrilla Warfare Behind the Enemy , Establish and Consolidate Our Bases , Constrict Enemy @-@ Occupied Territories , and Coordinate With the Main Force in Battle
With the focus on the enemyTs objective , which is to carry on with their offensive against us , and , also , to pull out some troops to attack the guerrilla war at a determined period of time , in an attempt to consolidate the territories it has occupied and make it difficult for China to counterattack , the fourth task of the entire nation is to develop on a massive scale the guerrilla warfare in the enemy &apos;s rear .
Establish many bases , consolidate them , and use them to decrease the size of the enemy &apos;s occupied territories .
Fight in coordination with the main force.to stop the enemy &apos;s advance at present and , later , to carry out the counteroffensive .
An important characteristic of the anti @-@ Japanese national war of the semi @-@ colonial country of China is the wide @-@ scale and protracted nature of the guerrilla war .
Without it , it would be impossible to tie up large numbers of enemy troops and give strong support in battle to the regular troops and stop the enemy &apos;s offensive ; it would not be possible to restrict the enemy &apos;s occupied territories to limited areas and prevent the enemy from occupying all of it ; nor would it be possible to erect many anti @-@ Japanese bastions behind the enemy &apos;s lines , persist in guerrilla warfare , and prepare to coordinate with the regular troops to mount , the strategic counteroffensive in the future .
Therefore , first , guerrilla warfare must he developed widely in all the areas behind enemy lines , a vast number of bases for guerrilla warfare must be set up , and those that have already been set up must be consolidated .
Second , we must follow the example of North China and retain or dispatch an ample number of regular troops to the various strategic areas in the enemy &apos;s rear to form the mainstay of the protracted guerrilla war .
These troops must learn
guerrilla tactics gradually , strengthen their political work , develop mass movements , set up bases , and help the people &apos;s guerrilla units and the guerrilla warfare they are waging to become regular troops and wage a regular war .
Third , the zeal of all men and women in all the war areas and behind the enemy lines to defend the country and protect their villages must be mobilized .
Besides mobilizing them in large numbers to participate in the guerrilla units separated from production work and filling the ranks of the regular troops left behind the enemy lines , organize them into quasi @-@ military anti @-@ Japanese people &apos;s defense units .
The organization of anti @-@ Japanese peopleTs defense units should become a regular and wide @-@ spread system in all the war areas and behind the enemy lines .
They must not become divorced from production .
Fourth , the people must be helped in organizing guerrilla units on a wide @-@ scale .
These units are divorced from production , and all counties and areas should have them so that they will become tiny units for attacking the enemy and defending the area .
Fifth , to enhance their combat effectiveness , political work must be established in these guerrilla units , education in military affairs , politics , culture ^ and recreation must be strengthened .
Sixth , correct systems in military affairs and political matters must be established in the guerrilla units , equal treatment of officers and men implemented , and economic matters handled openly .
Seventh , reform the bandit bands and make them take the road of resistance against Japan , and wipe out bandit bands that are behind our lines and those being utilized by the enemy .
Eighth , the supply of ammunition for guerrilla warfare is a very important question .
On the one hand , the vast rear areas should supply them as much as they possibly can , and , on the other , every guerrilla warfare base should by all possible means set up small ordinance factories , so that they will be able to manufacture on their own ammunition , rifles , and hand grenades so that there will be no worry with regard to the lack of ammunition for the guerrilla war .
Ninth , in accordance with the enemy situation and our strategic needs , re @-@ delimit the war areas and administrative areas behind the enemy lines , and make them compatible with the new war situation .
Tenth , in accordance with strategic needs , the leadership of the various units and administrative areas behind the enemy lines must be unified in order to concentrate forces to resist the enemy , eliminate contradictions within ; but warlord like behavior of swallowing each other up must be opposed .
Enhance Military Techniques , Establish Mechanized Corps , and Make Ready the Strength for the Counterroffensive
The chief reason the enemy is able to penetrate deeply step by step despite its inferiority in numbers is , besides our political situation , that of our being inferior in techniques .
Focusing on the enemy &apos;s strong points and our shortcomings , the fifth task for the entire nation is the enhancement of military techniques , increasing the number of planes , artillery pieces , tanks , and skills for handling them , and prepare our strength to carry out the counteroffensive .
For this purpose , it is necessary , on the one hand , to utilize the manufacturing capability we have now , and those that can possibly grow , to begin manufacturing partially , and carry out this work in earnest .
Ori the other hand , use many methods to import new weapons from abroad for gradual improvement of military equipment , and to establish a truly modernized mechanized corps .
Without doubt we should view problems in the light
of reality .
In fact , large number of inferior weapons are being used in battles .
Therefore , we should call upon the troops and civilians of the entire nation to arm themselves .
We believe that inferior weapons can also defeat the enemy .
We must enhance the political spirit , improve battle methods , develop guerrilla warfare to make up for the inadequacy in modern weapons .
If we do not concentrate our efforts in this respect , we are ignoring the current and real problems , and it will not be possible to overcome the present difficulties .
In order to prepare for the strategic counteroffensive , we must , in the future , enhance new technics and establish new types of troops .
We should know that troops in sufficient strength , but lacking in modern , new techniques and equipment , will find it impossible to carry out the counter @-@ offensive and recover lost territory .
If we do not heighten our attention in this respect , and begin working on it as circumstances permit , we will be only looking at the present and forgetting the future , and it will not be possible to overcome difficulties .
In China , where man and material power are plentiful , it is definitely not an impossibility to gradually improve technical equipment , if only the political conditions and mobilization methods make progress , plus the fact that there is international aid .
Implement Democratic Politics Under Unified Leadership , Make the Relationship Between the Government and the People More Intimate , and Give Play to the Utmost the Massive Strength of the Anti @-@ Japanese Political Power
The enemy is taking advantage of our shortcomings , not only in the military , but also in the political fieldour political system is not being democratized and cannot establish close relationship with the broad masses of people .
In order to make up for these shortcomings , the sixth task for the entire nation will be in implementing a democratic system under concentrated leadership .
If there is no such reform , to win final victory over the Japanese will also be impossible .
Democratic politics Is the prime mover for mobilizing all new forces of the entire nation .
With this system , the anti @-@ Japanese zeal of the people throughout the country will be mobilized to an immeasurable degree , and become an inexhaustible well @-@ spring .
The accomplishment of great course of uniting the whole nation thoroughly is also dependent solely upon the establishment of a democratic system .
On this point , we must plan and execute on the basis of facts regarding all its aspects .
First , the convening of the Kuomintang political council has started the demoeratization of the nation on its first step .
Henceforth , we should effect the open and smooth progress of the work of the council , implement all of the resolutions made by it , and in accordance with the programs already passed by the council , conscientiously carry out the establishment of local political councils at various levels and in various provinces to implement democratic politics .
Second , we must ensure that the freedom of speech , publications , gathering , association , and belief set forth in the program of the war of resistance and national construction will be fully implemented within the boundaries of the entire nation .
These freedoms are encompassed within the war of resistance and national construction , and only by fully guaranteeing them will it be beneficial to the rousing of the anti @-@ Japanese , national construction forces on a general scale .
The problem here is to ensure that the laws and decrees of the central government will be carried out and not restricted at will
locally .
What should be restricted is the type of freedom which will not be beneficial to the war of resistance and national construction , that is , the freedom of traitors and pro @-@ Japanese factions , and the others should not be put on the restriction list .
Third , many democratic systems should be begun from the war areas and the enemy &apos;s rear .
For example , local governments to be elected by the people , and the higher level placing them in office .
The various levels of government in the war areas should adopt the committee system of democratic concentrated power , and also establish various organizations of people &apos;s representatives .
The government in the war areas should increase certain necessary work departments .
It should change the style of official documents , purge corrupt , decadent , and inefficient elements , and absorb anti @-@ Japanese activists .
It should lower salaries and promote a spartan life so as to be compatible with the arduous , complicated , and fluid circumstances of the war areas .
Under the unified leadership of the Central Government , the local governments of the war areas have the power to proclaim laws and decrees for the locality only .
With the exception of traitors , the male and female citizens of the war areas all.have the right to elect and be elected , and the freedom to speak , publish , gather , associate , and arm themselves to resist Japan .
All anti @-@ Japanese parties and factions in the war areas have publicly recognized legal status , etc .
If there are no such political reforms in the war areas , specially in the enemy &apos;s rear , it will be impossible to support a long and difficult war against Japan .
The methods mentioned above are all geared to binding closer the relationship between the government and the people , increasing the effective strength of the government so that it will play an enormous role in the war against Japan .
There is no question that any local governments throughout the country should be concentrated under the leadership of the Central Government , and there should not be any kind of disrespect shown to the leadership of the Central Government because the administrative area has been carved up by the enemy topographically .
The entire nation should implement the democratic system in accordance with the laws and decrees of the Central Government , but it should be unified unted the Central Government .
Expand the Unified People &apos;s Movements and Give Ail @-@ Out Support to the War
The seventh task for the entire nation is to expand various people &apos;s movements and unify them to give full support to the war .
The long and difficult war against Japan is entirely dependent upon the people .
It will not be possible to wage a protracted war without general development and nation @-@ wide unification of the people &apos;s movements .
This is especially so in the war areas and behind the enemy lines .
The war against Japan is now beset with new difficulties .
These difficulties can be overcome successfully only by mobilizing the people .
The following must be carried out throughout the nation , especially in the war areas and behind the enemy lines : First , guarantee the freedom of all anti @-@ Japanese groups and people &apos;s movements , clearly establish the legal status of people &apos;s groups .
Second , help the people &apos;s organizations materially and respect their independence .
Third , diligently establish various national salvation associations which have the participation of the broad masses of workers , peasants , youths , women , businessmen , independent
entreprenures , people in the field of culture and children , and established a unified organization based upon the two principles of fields of enterprise and areas .
Fourth , mobilize the masses to take active part in the various aspects of the war and actively support the government and the troops .
Speed is essential especially in the war areas .
Improve the Well @-@ Being of the Masses , and Rouse the Enthusiasm of the Masses for the War of Resistance and For Production
In the past , the problem of improving the well @-@ being of the masses has been carried out without much strength .
Therefore it was unable to rouse the zeal of the broad masses of working people for the war of resistance and for production , and this was extremely unfavorable for persisting in protracted warfare .
For this reason , the eighth task of the entire nation , henceforth , is in the following policies to be carried out to improve the well @-@ being of the masses .
First , preferential treatment is to be given to families of anti @-@ Japanese soldiers and disabled fighters .
Second , give aid to the refugees and disaster victims of the war areas .
Third , initiate suitable cut back in rent and interest behind the enemy lines .
Fourth , make equitable arrangement of food grains and.important daily necessary items .
Fifth , increase wages in a suitable manner and im prove the treatment of workers and staff .
Sixth , agree to the group contracting right of workers and peasants with employers and landlords .
Seventh , prohibit employers , landlords , master craftsmen , and foremen to illtreat , beat , and abuse workers and apprentices .
By implementing these preliminary steps toward improving the well @-@ being of the people , it will later cause an inevitable enhancement in the activism of the workers , peasants , and masses of poor people to support the government and participate in the war and in production .
Not only all of the mobilized help the war needs will be greatly changed , but the quantity and quality of industrial and &apos; agricultural production and flow of commerce will be greatly increased and enhanced , and the nation &apos;s economy will also be resolved satisfactorily on the basis of the new agriculture , industry , and commerce .
Implement the Hew Wartime Economic Policy To Pass Over the Difficult Obstacle of War
After the loss of the major cities and the communication lines , great difficulties will appear in the nation &apos;s finances and economy .
It will be impossible to pass over the period of war without new and effective methods .
However , we need only to implement the new policies and mobilize the forces of the people to be able to overcome any difficulties .
Therefore , the ninth task for the entire nation is to carry out new wartime financial and economic policies .
The main points are as follows : First , the objective of the new policy is to ensure the supply of necessary things to the anti @-@ Japanese armed troops , meet the demands of the people for necessary commodities , and fight against the enemy &apos;s economic blockade and economic sabotage .
Second , reconstruct national defense industries in the rear areas in a planned manner .
Begin on a small scale in the areas of urgent need and gradually expand and improve .
Absorb capital from the government , the people , and from abroad , and mobilize workers politically , ensuring a minimum in material
compensation , improve the administrative system of factories so as to increase production ratio .
All these are not only necessary , but also possible .
Third , coordinating political mobilization and government laws and decrees , develop the growth.of agriculture and handicraft production throughout the country , organize spring plowing and autumn harvesting movements so that the agricultural and handicraft industries throughout the country will develop under the new posture .
Give.attention to protecting agricultural implements , livestock , and handicraft workshops in the war areas so as to ensure that the areas that have been cut off will be self @-@ sufficient economically .
Fourth , protect the free enterprise of private industry and business , and , at the same time , pay attention to cooperative enterprises .
Fifth , on the principle of paying in accordance with one &apos;s ability to pay , alter and regulate various old taxes into a unified escalating tax , abolishing excessive taxation and levies and the system of allocation , so as to lighten the people &apos;s burden and benefit revenue gathering .
Sixth , utilizing political mobilization in coordination with government laws and decrees exact collections of national bonds and national salvation public rations , and mobilize the people to voluntarily donate money and food grains to supply the fighting troops and to have adequate financial receipts .
Seventh , carry out a planned struggle against the counterfeit notes issued by the enemy and its policy to sabotage our currency .
Those areas that have been cut off must be permitted to set up their own banks and issue local currency .
Eighth , launch a drive for honesty and change to a new wage system on a generally equal basis in accordance with the minimum standard of living .
Ninth , the national banks will make low interest loans to help the development of production enterprises and the flow of commodities .
Tenth , resume and develop postal and telecommunications in the war areas .
The above is but a general account .
There must be a determination to earnestly reform the old system and to implement the new , and to apply it as a resolute strength , in order to eliminate the new difficulties .
To persist in the protracted war , the core of the matter lies in organizing the productive activism of the broad masses of people to supply and serve the war .
The Chinese war of resistance is fought under a special situation , the principal and big cities and communications lines have been occupied , and it is mainly dependent upon the peasants and the rural areas for fighting the war of resistance .
The peasants have great power to support the war , but it requires necessary reforms both politically and economically .
The new policies mentioned here are set forth in accordance with this kind of special situations .
Implement the Educational Policy on the War of Resistance , and Make This Education Serve the Protracted War
Under the principle of all for the war , all cultural education work must be made to meet the needs of the war .
Therefore , the tenth task for the entire nation lies in carrying out the following various cultural education policies .
First , amend the school system , doing away with subjects that are not necessary or in urgent need , and change the administrative system to teach the subjects necessary to the war and give play to the enthusiasm of the student to study as the principle .
Second , establish , expand , and
strengthen various types of cadre schools to foster large numbers of anti @-@ Japanese cadres .
Third , develop mass education on a wide scale , organize all sorts of supplementary schooling , literacy movements , theatrical plays , singing , and sports .
Establish local popular newspapers of all kinds in front of the enemy lines and behind them so as to enhance the people &apos;s national culture and national consciousness .
Fourth , operate compulsory elementary schools so as to inculcate the new generation with the national spirit .
It is also necessary to mobilize the people politically and in coordination with government laws and decrees to effect all these .
But , mainly , it is dependent upon mobilizing the people to educate themselves , with the government providing suitable leadership and adjustment , and giving it what possible material aid there is .
It is not sufficient to accomplish the great task of enhancing national cultural and national consciousness by solely dependent upon the government using limited financial resources to run a few schools and newspapers .
Since the war began the educational system has already begun to change , and there has been very obvious progress made in the war areas .
But , up to now , the entire system has not changed to meet the needs of the war , and this situation is not good .
The great war of resistance must be combined with a great war of resistance educational movement , and the situation of non @-@ combination of the two must be eliminated .
Strive To Obtain International Aid and Concentrate Our Efforts On Opposing Japanese Imperialism
Proceeding from the principle of protracted warfare and concentrated opposition against Japanese imperialism , we cannot ignore the organization of all possible aid from abroad .
Therefore , the current eleventh task is in * first , opposing the advocacy of some people on taking the road of Germany and Italy , because this is in reality a measure taken in preparation to surrendering to the enemy .
Second , strive all out to increase the aid given us by the various democratic countries and the Soviet Union , and , at the same time , exert all efforts to bring about a League of Nations sanction against Japan by various countries .
Third , set up a permanent organization to systematically collect the facts of enemy brutalities and compile a factual record to report and spread throughout the world to focus the world &apos;s attention and rouse it to punish the Japanese fascists .
Fourth , select representatives from various parties and factions , as well as various people &apos;s organizations and organize them into an international propaganda group which will visit all countries to evoke the sympathy of the peoples and governments of the various countries in coordination with the diplomacy of our government .
Fifth , protect the foreign residents of China who are sympathetic to us and those who are peacefully engaged in business or missionary work .
Sixth , give attention to protecting the interests of overseas Chinese , and , through the efforts of these overseas Chinese , propel forward the movements in various countries to oppose Japan and help China .
In these respects , without regard to whether the aid from various countries has not changed in.degree or can possibly decrease in part , and the League of Nations &apos; resolution being fine rhetoric , we should still strive to do our best .
In accordance with the protracted nature of the war , the foreign policy should also be geared for long @-@ term and not for immediate benefits .
Its emphasis must be in future aid , and this kind of foresight is necessary .
Establish An Anti @-@ Aggression Front Between China , the Soldiers and Civilians of Japan , and the Oppressed Nationalities of Korea and Taiwan , and Oppose Japanese Imperialism Together
The Japanese imperialist war of aggression not only endangers China , at the same time it endangers all the soldiers and civilians of Japan and the oppressed nationalities of Korea and Taiwan .
To defeat Japan &apos;s war of aggression there must be a massive and determined striving together of the soldiers and civilian masses of the two big nations of China and Japan , and the oppressed nationalities of Korea and Taiwan , and a common united front to oppose aggression must be established .
For this purpose , the twelfth task for the entire nation is , first , propose to the masses of soldiers and people of the two countries of Japan and Chinas and the Korean and Taiwanese nationalities this policy of a united front against aggression , and call upon them to struggle for this .
Second , the government is to issue orders to all officers and men of the anti @-@ Japanese and guerrilla units to learn a sufficient Japanese vocabulary .
High @-@ level political departments must prepare to dispatch Japanese instructors to the various troops and carry this out .
Beginning with a few words until conversations can be held with Japanese officers and soldiers .
Educate all the officers and men fighting the Japanese to orally propagandize the enemy &apos;s soldiers and low @-@ ranking officers and , at the same time , use written words and illustrations to convert them gradually , requesting their assent to set up a united front , against aggression together , and turning the more than 1 million Japanese troops into a friendly force which will withdraw from China and overthrow the Japanese fascists- Third , respect and treat well enemy prisoners of war and educate them so that they will influence others and efforts will be made to establish a united front against aggression .
Fourth , try to organize the people in.the field of culture in Japan who are opposed to aggression and bring them to China to participate in this struggle .
Fifth , protect the Japanese residents in China who are.sincerely loyal .
Sixth , educate the military and people masses of our country to , on the one hand , enhance national self @-@ respect and , on the other , to correct the wrong ideas that exist between the military and the people , to distinguish Japanese imperialism from the Japanese people , the enemy officers and their soldiers , and also distinguish high @-@ ranking officers from the low @-@ ranking ones .
By implementing the above policies and methods , and together with the massive and determined efforts , this anti @-@ aggression united front can be formed .
China &apos;s victory is dependent mainly upon the increase of its own strength , but we must seize upon the coordination of the enemy &apos;s difficulties and international aid .
With regard to the enemy &apos;s difficulties , besides the fact of the gradual attrition inflicted on the enemy through our protracted warfare and our strenuous diplomatic efforts to isolate Japan , it is indispensable to have the policy of establishing a common anti @-@ aggression front with the Japanese soldiers and civilians , and the oppressed nationalities of Korea and Taiwan .
The longer the Japanese war of aggression goes on , the better the possibility will be for laying the foundation of this united front .
Unite All the Nationalities in China In Opposition to the Japanese
Our Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front is not only of the various parties and factions and classes of the country , but also of all the nationalities in the nation .
Focusing on the enemy &apos;s evil schemes which have already been set in motion to split our minority nationalities within the country , and which they will intensify , the thirteenth task is to unite all nationalities as one to confront the enemy together .
For this purpose , it is necessary to give attention to the following points : First , the Meng , Hui , Tsang , Miao , Yao , I , and Fan minorities must be allowed to have equal rights with the Han people .
Under the principle of common struggle against Japan , they have the right to control their own affairs , and , at the same time , unite with the Han people to establish a unified country .
Second , in areas where minority nationalities and the Han people are intermingled , the local government should organize a committee composed of local minority nationals to form a part of the provincial or county government .
It will administer affairs concerning them , adjust relationships among the various nationalities , and there should be a seat in the provincial or county government committees .
Third , respect the culture , religion , and customs of the minority nationalities .
Not only should they not be forced to learn Chinese and speak it , but they should be helped to develop the culture education of using their own spoken and written language .
Fourth , correct the big Han chauvinism that still exists , and promote equal treatment of minority nationalities by the Han people so as to bring relationships closer together .
At the same time it is prohibited to use slighting or insulting remarks , written words , or actions toward them .
The various minority nationalities should unite together and strive for the implementation of the above mentioned policies .
On the one hand the government should implement it on its own initiative .
Only thus can the relationships between the various nationalities in the country be truly improved and achieved , in reality , a unity against outsiders .
The old method of patronizing is no longer viable .
Launch the Movement To Root Out Traitors and Consolidate the Front Lines and Rear Areas
Under the new situation , traitors , enemy spies , Trotskyites , and pro @-@ Japanese factions will become even more rampant than before , vigorously engaging in their schemes to create rumor , slander , division , and sabotage .
Therefore , the current fourteenth task is in carrying out the .following methodsthe launching of a campaign to root out traitors .
First , rouse the alertness of all of the military and the civilians in the front lines and the rear areas to keep tight surveillance on traitors , enemy spies , Trotskyites , and pro @-@ Japanese factions and their activities , and mercilessly suppress them in accordance with the government &apos;s , laws .
Second , pay attention to protecting state secrets .
Renegades who leak such secrets should be punished as traitors to the country .
Third , add a course on rooting out traitors in school books so as to carry out an education to heighten alertness .
In the military , set up work departments at various levels for rooting out traitors .
Small groups to root out traitors are to be set up in mass organizations and people &apos;s defense units , and stepped @-@ up education in rooting out traitors
should be given to the state police so that these traitors will have no place to hide under such concentrated surveillance .
Since the war of resistance began , the number of times we have suffered at the hands of these traitors cannot be counted .
Long ago , fighters on the front lines , were in general concensus on the frightening numbers of traitors and the magnitude they wrought on the war .
In the rear areas , just the two events of leaking state secrets and leading enemy planes to a devastating raid are deeply imprinted with hate in the minds of all .
If renegades are not eliminated in the protracted war , there can be no thought of victory in the war .
Mobilizing the national revolutionary alertness of the broad masses , and executing the aforementioned rooting out of traitors , as well as making this a massive movement , is a grave task indispensable to achieving victory .
It should be pointed out that in rooting out traitors distinction must be made between the leaders and the followers , those who consciously take part and those who were deceived , the determined ones and the vacillating ones .
They must be treated differently .
Heavy punishment should be given and the latter should be treated leniently .
They must not be treated all alike .
Attention must be given to factual evidence , no torture must be used in questioning , and false accusations must be strictly guarded against .
The objective of rooting out traitors is to eliminate real renegades , and this objective can be achieved only by using correct policies and methods .
Develop the Strong and Consolidated United Front of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party , As Well As Other Parties and Factions , To Support the Protracted War
All of the urgent tasks set forth above must wait for the various parties and factions in the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front against Japan to motivate the entire nation , and , under the unified leadership of Generalissimo Chiang , resolutely implement them .
In order to achieve this objective , the organizational strength of the various parties and factions in the United Front must be developed .
The present strength , regardless of which party , is too inadequate , and they all must be developed .
And especially the development of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is the current urgent task .
In this task of development , the various parties concerned should approve of the development of others .
They should not become envious of each other and impede each other &apos;s progress .
We must know that if it is an anti @-@ Japanese party its development will be beneficial to the war against Japan .
There is no doubt that the United Front has the Kuomintang and the Communist Party for its base , and the Kuomintang is the main pillar of these two .
We admit to this fact .
Therefore , we resolutely support Generalissimo Chiang and the Nationalist Government and Kuomintang under his leadership , and we call upon the entire nation to give them support .
Admitting and supporting this mainstay and , at the same time , develop the various parties , are mutually related and not mutually conflicting .
In numbers , I believe the Kuomintang should develop to over 5 million men , the Communist Party and the other parties should develop to over a million .
In a big nation of 450 million to absorb several million superior elements
to participate in the anti @-@ Japanese parties and factions in an era of a great war of resistance is not only necessary but completely possible .
If this can be done , the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front will be expanded , and along with it it will become even more consolidated .
It fully ensures the implementation of all tasks aimed at defeating the enemy .
The support of the protracted war and the long @-@ term cooperation , and the basic objective of driving out the Japanese and establishing a new China based upon the three principles will be ours .
Protracted Warfare and Long @-@ Term Cooperation
Let us now discuss specifically on the protracted nature of the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front and give a complete answer to the many problems that have occurred to those people who are extremely concerned about the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party .
This has important significance with regard to the consolidation and expansion of the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front , the consolidation and expansion of the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party , and the smooth implementation of the current urgent tasks to pass over the difficult obstacle of war .
The problems are as follows : the protracted nature of the war determines the long @-@ term nature of the cooperation , the cooperation in the war determines the cooperation after the war , the context of the long @-@ term cooperation and its chief conditionsthe Three People &apos;s Principles and communismthe organizational form of the long @-@ term cooperation , the policy of mutual aid and concession in the long @-@ term cooperation , and the problem of a democratic republic .
Many people are concerned about these and we should give clear @-@ cut answers .
The Protracted Nature of the Struggle Determines the Long @-@ Term Nature of the Cooperation
Due to the fact that the war of resistance against Japan is a protracted one , the entire Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front can and will have to be a long one , and the cooperation between the two principal partiesthe Kuomintang and the Communist Partycan , and also will have to be , a long @-@ term one .
This is the point from which all policies proceed .
Therefore , our policy must , at all cost , have a long @-@ term national united front , a long @-@ term cooperation .
We must , at all cost , together preserve a unified government , oppose division and splits , and thus benefit the .passing over of the difficulties of war , oppose enemy sabotage , beat back Japanese imperialism , and accomplish the task of establishing a new China after the war .
This is quite different from the Kuomintang @-@ Communist Party cooperation from 1924 to 1927 .
That was only for a short period , but this is a long @-@ term affair .
Cooperation in the War Determines Cooperation After the War
The so @-@ called long @-@ term cooperation applies not only to during the war , but also after it .
The war against Japan is a protracted one , and the cooperation
in the war can be said to be a long @-@ term one .
But that is not enough , we hope to continue cooperating and are determined to do so .
What guarantee is there to it ?
The guarantee lies in the cooperation during the war determines the cooperation after the war .
The principal parties of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front must face difficulties together , exist or become extinct together .
They must strive to attain progress , and only through prolonged efforts can they beat back Japanese imperialism .
Otherwise , it will not be possible to do so .
With two progressive parties that have faced difficulties during such a long period of time after the war is over , they will then form a foundation for continuing cooperation .
At that time , conditions domestically and internationally will be even more conducive to cooperation , and this can be estimated now .
There is no doubt that the contexts of the various stages of the cooperation in the war will exist , and there will be even more new contents in the cooperation after the war .
But the cooperation in the war will determine that there can be cooperation after the war .
This is not an estimation made without basis .
The Content of Long @-@ Term Cooperation and Its Principal Condition
The so @-@ called long @-@ term cooperation is the long @-@ term national united front .
All classes , from capitalists to the workers , all political parties , from the Kuomintang to the Communist Party , all nationalities , from the Ran to the Miao and Yao minority nationalities , all the troops , from the Nationalist armies to the Eighth Route Army , and all the governments , from the Nationalist government.to the Shensi @-@ Kansu @-@ Ninghsia Border Region Government , are all included , with the exception of national renegades .
Furthermore , they will be in the United Front for a long time .
There are some people who cannot endure the arduous struggle of the protracted war .
When that time comes they are apt to place their individual interests over that of the national interests and become national renegades .
Therefore , the National United Front must continuously weed out these national renegades .
But these weeding out still leaves the National United Front as it is .
The reason is that the main condition for long @-@ term cooperation is , first of all , the brutality of the enemy &apos;s war and its protracted nature .
Because the enemy is waging a barbaric war it gravely endangers the very existence of the various class strata of the entire nation .
Accordingly , it compelled the higher class strata to oppose the Japanese together with the other classes .
It is inevitable that a part of the higher class level will withdraw from the anti @-@ Japanese front .
But the other parts are generally in the same position as the other classes .
They are oppressed and there is no way out except through resistance .
Also , because this barbaric war is a long one , it determines the long @-@ term nature of the cooperation .
All these concerns the aspects determining the cooperation to be a long @-@ term affair .
But there is another aspect .
It requires the various cooperating parties , mainly the Kuomintang and the Communist Party , must adopt a correct policy and carry out work that is necessary .
What kind of policy and work should they be ?
They should be policy and work set forth and carried out on the basis of protracted war and long @-@ term cooperation .
It should be a policy and work that will take care of the present and the future , this class and that classs this party and that party , this army and that army , and this nationality and that nationality .
Otherwise the policy
176will be incorrect and the work cannot be carried out , thereby creating confusion and will make it difficult for the cooperation to last long .
Due to the fact that , on the one hand , the enemyfs war is barbaric in nature , and , on the .
other , because of the correct policy and the necessary work to be done in the United Front , the Chinese National United Front should , and can be , a protracted one .
It is a national front and not a people &apos;s front .
It includes the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party during and after the war , and it is not a cooperation planned to split into civil war after the war has ended ,
The Three People &apos;s Principles and Communism
The Three People &apos;s Principles is the political foundation for the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front and the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party .
But what is the relationship between the Three People &apos;s Principles and the Communist Party ?
What attitude should Communist Party members adopt toward it ?
Up to now there are still some people who are not clear on this point , and , therefore , it will be necessary to explain it once more .
In the provisional congress of our party held in May 1936 , it passed the following document on &quot; resolutely implement the Three People &apos;s Principles . &quot;
&quot; Is the Communist Party in agreement with the Three People &apos;s Principles ?
Our answer is , yes ..
The Three People &apos;s Principles has its historical changes .
The revolutionary Three PeopleTs Principles of Dr.
Sun Yat @-@ sen gained the trust of the people through cooperation with the Communist Party and by resolute implementation .
It launched the victorious great revolution of 1925 to 1927 .
And because ; .it drove out the communists ( the movement to purge the Party ) and carry &quot; out a contrary policy , it lost the trust of the people and brought about the failure of the revolution .
Because the national and social peril are now extremely grave , there is an urgent request for cooperation between the two parties from the people of the nation and patriotic elements in the Kuomintang .
Therefore , the spirit of the Three .
People * s Principles has been reorganized .
Under the principles of nationalism with independence and liberation internationally , the people &apos;s powerism of democratic freedom domestically , and the increase of the people &apos;s happiness under the principle of people &apos;s livelihood , the two parties came into cooperation again and led the people in resolutely carrying these principles out .
This completely meets the historical needs of the Chinese revolution , and each party member should understand and recognize it .
The Communist Party will never discard its ideals of socialism and communism .
They must go through the stage of bourgeois democratic revolution in order to reach the stage of socialism and communism .
The Communist Party has.its own party and political programs .
The Party program is socialism and communism , and it is different from the Three People &apos;s Principles .
Its democratic revolutionary political program is more thorough than any other parties &apos; or factions &apos; , but basically , it is not in conflict with the Three People &apos;s Principles program proclaimed by the first and second congress of the Kuomintang .
Therefore , we not only do not reject the Three People &apos;s Princples , but are willing to resolutely implement it .
We , furthermore , requested the Kuomintang to join us in implementing the Three People &apos;s
Principles , and also called upon the people of the whole country to implement the Three People &apos;s Principles so as to enable the Kuomintang , the Communist Party , and the people of the whole country to struggle together for the three great objectives of national independence , freedom of people &apos;s powers , and happiness in the lives of the people . &quot; ( The task of the Chinese Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front in its current stage , p 11 )
On 22 September of last year , our Party Central Committee , in the announcement proclaiming the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party , emphasized : &quot; The Three People &apos;s Principles of Dr.
Sun Yat @-@ sen is necessary today .
Our Party is willing to struggle for its thorough implementation . &quot;
Why did such a political party as the Communist Party adopt this attitude ?
It is quite obvious that national independence , freedom of people &apos;s rights , and the happiness of people &apos;s livelihood are the general objective that the Communist Party seeks to realize in the national democratic revolutionary stage .
It is also the general objective sought by the people of the nation , and it is not a thing sought by a certain party on its own .
Understanding will come if you only look at the documents since the founding of the Communist Party and its political program .
Therefore , in the past , not only during the first period of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party from 1924 to 1927 , our Party members had resolutely implemented the Three People &apos;s Principles .
Even after the unfortunate disruption of the two party cooperation in 1927 , all our actions did not contravene the Three People &apos;s Principles .
At that time we resolutely opposed imperialism , and this is in conformity with nationalism .
We implemented the political system of people &apos;s congresses , and this is in conformity with the principle of people &apos;s rights ; we also initiated the land system of fanners having their own land to cultivate , and this conforms with the principle of people &apos;s livelihood .
All our methods did not exceed the basic category of the system of private property of the bourgeoisie and the democratic revolution .
The current stage of the war of resistance and the stage to thoroughly establish a democratic republic are , by nature , .the stages of the Three People &apos;s Principles and the bourgeois democratic revolution .
In .order to thoroughly carry out this task of the democratic stage , all Communist Party members , undoubtedly , should sincerely implement the Three People &apos;s Principles in accordance with the general revolutionary policy they always have , as well as their own resolution and announcement , and work together with the Kuomintang , the other parties , and the broad masses pf the people throughout the country .
Whoever is not loyal to the beliefs of the Three People &apos;s Principles and implementing it , he is a hypocrite , not a loyal Marxist .
In China , anybody loyal to Marxism , has two responsibilities at the same time , one is the current actual task , and the other Is the far reaching ideals of the future .
It must be understood that only by completing as much as possible the current task can there be a basis and a foundation to develop into the far @-@ reaching and great ideal is communism , and it is the most perfect social system for all mankind .
Dr.
Sun Yat @-@ sen had also considered the necessity of implementing it in order to resolve future social problems .
The so @-@ called real task of the present is the Three People &apos;s Principles .
This is the task of the present stage to &quot; achieve equal status internationally , politically , and economically , &quot; and it is a demand made by the Kuomintang , the Communist Party , and the people of the entire country .
Therefore , Communist Party members should study the
Three People &apos;s Principles as carefully as they did with communism , and apply the viewpoint of Marxism to study the theories of the Three People &apos;s Principles in order to find out how the Three People &apos;s Principles can be implemented in a concrete manner , and how to use the correct ideas of the Three People &apos;s Principles to educated the masses so as to bring about a transformation from understanding to action , and struggle to beat back Japanese imperialism and construct a new China based upon the Three People &apos;s Principles .
The Organizational Form for Long @-@ Term Cooperation
In order to ensure.long @-@ term cooperation , it will still be necessary to resolve the problem of the organizational form for cooperation .
We have already rejected the idea of one @-@ party @-@ ism .
Whether it is in respect to past history , with respect to the current task , and with respect to the natural qualities of Chinese society , there is no basis at all for one @-@ party @-@ ism .
It cannot be achievedj nor can it be implemented .
It betrays the major objective of uniting all to oppose Japan and construct the nation , and is thoroughly harmful .
Then , is there a need for a kind of unified and common organization for the various parties to co @-@ exist and form a national united front against Japan ?
Yes , and it is necessary .
Without such a unified and common organization for all , it will not help with the effort to unite and oppose Japan , and it is even more harmful to long @-@ term cooperation .
Therefore , the various parties should earnestly study and find a unified and common organizational form which will be most suitable for long @-@ term cooperation .
Let us take this under study now .
Due to the historical characteristics of the various parties and China &apos;s politics and economy , today &apos;s view presents three kinds of organizational forms as follows .
First , the Kuomintang itself is transformed into a national alliance , with the various parties participating in the Kuomintang but retaining their independent nature .
But this will be different from the first cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party .
Lf the Kuomintang agrees to our participation , what attitude shall we adopt ?
First , we approve of this method , because this is one of the best kinds of united organizational for the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front , and it will be beneficial to national construction .
It is not only the Communist Party , but all other parties as well which can participate in the Kuomintang .
As long as the Kuomintang agrees to it , we will definitely not oppose it .
If it is done this way , we can then apply the method differently from the 13 years of cooperation .
That is , first , all Communist Party members will openly participate in the Kuomintang , and a list of such party members will be provided to the Kuomintang &apos;s leading organization .
Second , we will not enlist any Kuomintang members to join the Communist Party .
Those that want to join will be counselled not to do so in order to preserve the general situation .
Third , if our young party members have been approved by the Kuomintang to participate in the Three People &apos;s Principles Youth League , it shall be the same .
There will be no organization of secret party or groups , and we shall
not accept non @-@ communist members to enter our Party .
The use of this method there will be peaceful assurrance for everybody , and it will be beneficial to all and without harmful effects .
This is the first type of organizational form for the United Front .
The second kind is for the various parties to organize a national alliance and support Chiang Kai @-@ shek as the supreme leader of this alliance .
The various parties , on the basis of equality , dispatch representatives to organize a committee of all parties concerned from the Central Government to the various levels of local governments to work for the implementation of the common program and administer common matters .
This is also a good form , and we also approve it .
We proposed such a form long ago , but unfortunately , it was not implemented .
The third kind is the present method .
There are no formulated documents , no need for set sites , and when problems arise , consultations will be held between the two parties to resolve them .
But this form of organization is too loose , and many problems cannot be resolved satisfactorily and in a timely manner .
For instance , the implementation of major political policies and the adjustment of friction in lower echelons have been neglected because there was no fixed organization to handle them .
Therefore , this method is not beneficial toward long @-@ term cooperation .
However , if the first and second methods are inapplicable , this method can temporarily remain as it is .
The Policy of Mutual Aid and Mutual Concession in the Long @-@ Term Cooperation
It has been said before that a protracted war requires a long @-@ term united front , and this is the proceeding point for all policies .
Therefore , Communist Party members must keep in mind this long @-@ term nature in their work and in their relationships with friendly parties .
He should carry out with determination all those that are beneficial to this long @-@ term cooperation , and should absolutely refrain from doing those that will be harmful to it .
Herein occurs the problem of mutual aid and mutual concession among the various parties .
With regard to mutual aid , for example , the various parties must develop and consolidate .
Any party , besides attending to its own expansion and consolidation , should also adopt an approving attitude toward the development and consolidation of a friendly party .
What kind of attitude should a Communist &apos; Party member adopt toward the expansion and consolidation of the Kuomintang ?
In a word , approve .
The reason is that the expansion and consolidation of the Kuomintang will be beneficial to the war against Japan and to the entire nation .
Thus , it is also beneficial to the working people and the Communist Party .
I have discussed this before .
The Kuomintang is presently organizing the Three People1s Principles Youth League .
What kind of attitude should a Communist Party member adopt ?
Without doubt he should adopt an attitude of approval .
We hope that the Youth League will develop massively .
If the Youth League is carried out in accordance
with Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s declaration , there is a bright future for its development .
Because we approve and support it , we hope that revisions will be made in certain items of the methods presently implemented in the League .
Otherwise a good cause will not bring forth good results .
The Three People &apos;s Principles Youth League should become a united organization for the broad masses of youths and people of China to unite and save the nation .
It should absorb various parties and factions , youths of various circles , and individual young mensT and youth organizations to become a massive group in which the entire generation of youths will collectively receive national revolutionary education and training .
Therefore , it should be organizationally democrati @-@ cized , and the spirit of initiative and consciousness of the organization members should be given play politically to rouse the enthusiasm of the masses of youths .
This is our attitude and our proposals to the Three People &apos;s Principles Youth League .
Mutual aid is not mutual despoliation , benefiting oneself from another &apos;s loss .
As an individual it is morally wrong , and it is even more so with regard to national morals .
Therefore , unreasonable frictions , even to the extent of arresting and killing people , just cannot be done .
Communist Party members absolutely should not treat friendly parties in this manner , but should he be treated in this manner , we definitely will not let It go at that .
All unreasonable matters must be treated sternly , and this is the correct way to treat others and oneself .
Mutual counselling is a virtue among friends , and it is also an attitude that should be promoted among the political parties .
What kind of mutual concessions are there to be made in the United Front ?
There are such concessions .
We had made political concessions , stopping the confiscation of land , reorganizing the Red Army , changing the system of the Soviet areas .
This is a type of political concession , and a necessary measure to establish the United Front and unite the people of the nation to fight the enemy together .
Our friendly Party has also made concessions by admitting the legal status of the Communist Party , etc .
The policy of mutual concession for uniting against the enemy and for long @-@ term cooperation is a very good and correct one .
It is only the politically confused , or those with covert ideas , will say that the Communist Party has surrendered to the Kuomintang , or vice versa .
We now again advocate that all the parties in the United Front should not enroll members of the other parties , organize branch parties , and engage in secret activities .
We hold that such a policy is necessary .
Of course , today is different from the past .
In the civil war of the past , besides open warfare between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party , secret methods were used on both sides to sabotage the activities of the other side .
After cooperation , there naturally should not be motives and actions for sabotaging each other .
But the method of secretly recruiting party members from the otherTs ranks to form party branches should also stop so that both sides will be assurred .
Only thus can it become compatible with the objective of long @-@ term cooperation in a protracted war .
We officially announce to the comrades of the Kuomintang that we have stopped our activities to recruit party members
from your ranks to organize party branches .
Regardless of what kind of common organizational form is adopted for the United Front , we will abide by our decision .
But at the same time , we hope you will reciprocate .
After such an agreement has been arrived at , and a lover @-@ level party member should renege , then the higher level of the renegade should be responsible for handling this matter .
Besides , when comrades of both sides meet , the attitude to be adopted should be one of friendliness , respect , and consultation , and not one of arrogance , contempt , and arbitrariness in order to improve mutual relationships , and this is also necessary .
Communist Party members should first put into effect all that we have said , regardless of whether some of the personnel on the other side have not applied the same policy , method , and attitude in treating us .
We shall still do it this way , and , in the long run , some of those who are not clear about this will come around to an understanding .
A Communist Party member should adhere to his own standpoint in matters concerning the nation and the people , and march toward the direction of defeating the Japanese and constructing a new China without the slightest deviation .
Whoever betrays this standpoint and this direction will lose his qualifications to be a Communist Party member .
But the Communist Party member must have the spirit of mutual aid and mutual concession .
They must have the spirit of respecting friendly parties and to resolve problems through friendly , consultative attitude .
Wherever there are comrades of friendly parties present , they should be consulted to resolve related matters , and it must not be done arbitrarily .
Without such a spirit there would be no consolidated unified unity , and the objective of defeating the enemy and constructing a new China , and the so @-@ called enterprises for the nation and for the people cannot be attained .
Therefore , the necessary policy of mutual concession absolutely must not be translated into negativism .
Not only is mutual aid activism , but so is mutual concession , because necessary concessions is an indispensable condition to consolidating the cooperation of the two parties to attain even better unity and greater progress .
On the Problem of.a Democratic Republic
Although our party , in September 1936 , announced the resolution on constructing a democratic republic , and comrades of the Central Committee have explained this question , there are many outside our circle who do.not understand our proposals .
This is a problem concerned with the future of the war of resistance .
What will be the result of the war of resistance ?
With regard to the so @-@ called war of resistance and national construction , what kind of a nation should be established in accordance with the Communist Party &apos;s ideas ?
This is a problem that is with us , and to.explain it once more will be beneficial to the consolidation of the confidence of various parties and factions in the long @-@ term cooperation .
What kind of a nation should be established ?
The answer in a word is the establishment of a republic based upon the Three People &apos;s Principles .
The democratic republic as we called it is the republic of the Three People &apos;s Principles and its nature is that of the Three People &apos;s Principles .
According to Dr.
Sun Yat @-@ sen , it is one that &quot; seeks equal status internationally , an equal political status , and equality in the economic status . &quot; First , it is a country of nationalism .
It is an independent nation and will not be subjected to any interference from any country and , at the same time , it will not interfere with any foreign nations .
That is to say that the original semi @-@ colonial status of China has been changed , and it has become independent .
At the same time , regardless of how powerful it becomes , it absolutely will not turn itself into an imperialist country , but have peaceful intercourse and co @-@ exist in friendship in the spirit of equality with all the friendly countries that respect China &apos;s independence .
Equal rights will be given to the various nationalities in the country and , under the principle of their own volition , to unite and establish a unified government .
Second , this country will be &apos;a nation based upon the rights of the people .
The people in the country will all have equal political status , officials at various grades will be elected by the people , and the political system will be that of democratic centralization .
National and local assemblies of people &apos;s representatives will be established , and citizens over the age of 18 , with the exception of criminals , will all have the right to elect and be elected , regardless of class , sex , nationalities , beliefs , and education .
The nation will give the people the freedom of speech , publications , gathering , association , beliefs , residence and change of residence , and to protect them politically and materially .
Third , it is a country based upon the people &apos;s livelihood .
It does not deny the system of private ownership , but it requires that workers will have jobs and their working conditions are to be improved .
Farmers will have land to cultivate , and excessive taxation and exorbitant rentals and usurious interest rates are to be abolished .
The students will be able to continue with their education , but it also guarantees that the poor will.be able to attend school .
The other fields will be occupied with tasks and they can give full rein to their geniuses .
In short , it is to enable every one to have clothing and food , schooling and jobs .
The democratic republic we envisaged is precisely such a nation , a China truly based upon the Three People &apos;s Principles .
It is not a Soviet , nor is it socialism .
With whom must we struggle to transform China into such a country ?
We must struggle against Japanese imperialism .
Japanese imperialism deprived us of our independence , and we must get it back from them .
Japanese imperialism considered us as slaves , and we must demand from them our freedom .
Japanese imperialism brought hunger and cold upon us , and we must demand food from them .
How are these to be done ?
Demand it at gunpoint .
In brief , driving away Japanese imperialism will give us an independent , free , and prosperous new China based upon the Three People * s Principles .
China &apos;s War Against Aggression and the Anti @-@ Fascist Movement of the World
China Cannot Be Separated From the World
China is closely bound to the world , and the Sino @-@ Japanese war is part of the world war .
The victory of China &apos;s war of resistance against Japan cannot be isolated from the rest of the world .
In the new situation of the war of resistance it is possible that part of the foreign aid will decrease , thereby making China &apos;s self @-@ reliance efforts even more significant .
China should , at all times , rely upon self @-@ reliance as the basic standpoint .
But China is not , and cannot be , isolated .
The fact of China &apos;s close ties with the world is also our standpoint , and should be our standpoint .
We are not and cannot have a closed @-@ door policy .
China could not do this a long time ago , and now an imperialism of a world @-@ wide nature has penetrated into China with war .
All Chinese are concerned about China &apos;s relation with the world , especially the current changes in the situation in Europe .
Therefore , it will be a significant thing to analyze the current international situation .
World War II To Carve Up the World Again Has Already Begun
The basic nature of capitalist imperialism is not only in contradiction with its own people , but it is also in contradiction with colonial and semi @-@ colonial countries , with socialist countries , and between the various imperialist countries .
The most intense expression of this last type of contradiction was in the world war of 20 years ago .
The result of that war between two groups of imperialist countries created a new international situation .
The new development of the world &apos;s politics and economy after the war resulted in the world again approaching a new great war .
The aggression of Japan against the four eastern provinces in the Orient and the coming on stage of Hitler launched the new world war to re @-@ divide the world .
It is quite true that &quot; fascism is war . &quot; Under this situation , Japan , Germany , and Italy , on the one hand , organized an aggression front , to carry out large @-@ scale aggression , and , on the other hand , the various democratic countries prepared for war in order to defend the benefits they already hold and in the name of preserving peace .
But up to now , they are still unwilling to use actual force to stop the aggressors , especially the British policy of compromise , in actuality , is helping the aggressors .
Under such circumstances , China &apos;s four eastern provinces were the first to.be sacrificed and , subsequently , Abyssinia was lost to the Italians .
In Spain it infused the rebel army with vigor , China was subjected to a new massive aggression by Japan , and , recently , Austria and Czechoslovakia were sacrificed to Hitler .
Six hundred million people of the world are in a state of war , and -its sphere covers the three continents of Asia , Africa , and Europe .
This is the current situation of the new world war .
The Characteristics of the Current World War
Due to the determination of Japan , Germany , and Italy to commit aggression on the one hand , and the unwillingness of the various democratic to use their
power to restrain them on the otherespecially with regard to the compromise policy of the Britishthere is a difference in characteristics displayed by the current situation of the new world from that o the World War I.
This characteristic is the aggression of countries in between first , and the adoption of various different forms of war .
China , Abyssinia , Austria , and Czechoslovakia are all semi @-@ independent or small countries , and Japan , Germany , and Italy selected them first for swallowing up .
In launching their aggression against these in @-@ between countries , the aggressors adopted three specific forms of warfare .
The first kind is the war launched by Japan against China , and by Italy against Abyssinia .
These are large @-@ scale wars conducted openly but carried out without a formal declaration of war , and it opens up a new era in the history of wars .
The objective in adopting this policy of undeclared war is to take advantage of the unwillingness of the various democratic countries to restrain themespecially Britain &apos;s policy of compromiseto temporary avoid coming into direct conflict with them and facilitate their moves to first seize the in @-@ between countries .
The second type is the form of aggression adopted by Germany and Italy against Spain .
They adopted the method of giving assistance to the rebel army .
This is but a replay of an old method abundantly found in history .
The third type is Hitler &apos;s aggression in Austria and Czechoslovakia .
On the surface there is no war ( no actual fighting ) , but the essence of war is there .
A powerful force of troops was moved in to occupy all of Austria and part of Czechoslovakia and to place the .
rest of Czechoslovakia under its rule .
This is a most ingenious method of seizing another country without fighting .
The utilization of these three forms of war , on the one hand , is because the strength of the aggressor countries themselves is not adequate and is temporarily unable to engage the various big countreis in direct warfare .
Therefore , this ingenious method was adopted in an attempt to first strengthen themselves and , at the same time , to weaken the various big countries and then engage them in war .
On the other hand , because of the unwillingness of the various democratic countries to restrain the aggressors , and specifically as a result of Britain &apos;s cowardly policy of compromise , it , in reality , aided the enemy and it made it easy for them to commit aggression against the countries in the middle .
Britain &apos;s Policy of Compromise Will Lead the Various Fascist Countries To Launch a War on an Even Greater Scale
The conservative cabinet of Britain headed by Chamberlain is carrying out step by step the so @-@ called policy of cooperation among the four powers .
After the Munich agreement it is possible taht the political situation in Europe will take a turn for the worse .
The major part of Britain &apos;s conservative party &apos;s policy , in principle , has all along rejected the Soviet Union and sought compromise with Germany and Italy .
Because of its fear of the Soviet Union becoming strong , of becoming involved in a war too early , of the people &apos;s movements in its own country and the movement for independence in the colonies , it has very early decided to sacrifice Spain , Austria , and Czechoslovakia and formed its plan to reject the Soviet Union and Seek compromise with Germany and Italy .
In the past , it was not successful because of the
division within the conservative party , the active policy of the popular front in France , and the censure received domestically and from abroad .
But now , they took advantage of the anti @-@ war physcology of the British and European people , and the rightist tendency of ( FlandinTs party of France to set up the Munich agreement under the threat of Hitler .
This agreement is the result of Britain &apos;s policy of compromise , and if it does not change its policy it definitely will induce the various fascist countries to mount an even more massive war of adventurism .
Although it is still possible that , for the time being , war will not break out among the big countries , and temporarily it will be limited to the continuation of aggresson of the countries in the middle , but , in the end , it will be inevitable that the various big countries will be dragged into a war of unprecedented ruthless @-@ ness .
This will be a future certainty .
The inevitable result of Chamberlain &apos;s policy will be like &quot; lifting a lock only to drop it on oners own toes . &quot;
The Majority of Mankind in the World Are on the Move to Mobilization
With respect to the various capitalist countries , they have come to a dead end because of the economic crisis , the war involving 600 million people has its impact on the whole world , and a new and even more massive war threatens mankind .
All Is bright and well with the socialist countries , and they are advanced and strong .
Under the comparison of these two opposite things , the majority of the people throughout the world are gradually finding the direction how to defend and liberate themselves , and they are uniting and preparing for war on an unprecedented massive scale and intensity .
World War I , the growing power of the socialist countries in the past 20 years , the weakening of the capitalist countries , the war of aggression waged by the fascist countries in the past 6 or 7 years , China &apos;s glorious war of resistance against Japan , the people * s war of Spain , and the compromise policy of Chamberlain have taught the people of the world and of Britain and France to understand that the only way out is to organize and put up a struggle .
There can be a way out only by uniting as one all mankind in the world who seek liberation , and the formation of a united front of the people of the world and all oppressed nationalities .
The glorious process of wakening the consciousness of the people throughout the world , their organization and struggle , and the formation of the united front is progressing in its development , but it will require arduous efforts before it can be completed .
The future of the fascist threat of war and Chamberlain &apos;s policy of compromise is certain to meet with massive opposition in the end , and it is also an inevitable result of the fascist war and Chamberlain &apos;s policy .
The Coordination of ChinaTs War Against Aggression and the Anti @-@ Fascist World Movement
It is common knowledge that in the past the various democratic countries all gave assistance to China in varying degrees , mainly in the sympathy expressed by their people for China .
The aid from the Soviet Union was even more positive .
Now , because of the deeper penetration of the Japanese offensive , it has intensified the contradictions between Japan and Britain , the United States , France , and the Soviet Union .
Although it is possible that Britain
may use its policy of compromise in the West and apply it to the Orient , and compromise to a certain degree with Japan in the hope of preserving some of its commercial enterprises in the occupied areas , and in dreaming to lessen Japan &apos;s threat to southeast Asia , it will find that a basic compromise will be difficult .
At least for the time being , it will be difficult because of Japan &apos;s policy to solely occupy China .
Under current concrete conditions , there are differences of a certain degree between the problems of the East and that of the West .
The deeper penetration of Japan &apos;s offensive against China has further intensified the contradiction between Japan and the United States .
The friendship between China and the Soviet Union has grown , and there is the possibility of increased friendship between China , the United States , and the Soviet Union .
But first of all , we must not forget the distinction between the capitalist and socialist countries , secondly , the distinction between a capitalist government and its people , and , thirdly , we must keep in mind even more firmly the distinction between the present and the future .
We must not place too great a hope on the former , but should exert ourselves to gain all possible aid from the former .
To a certain degree it is not only possible but also practical .
But to maintain too high a hope is not suitable .
The coordination between China &apos;s liberation movement and foreign aid is mainly the coordination in the future with progressive countries and the world @-@ wide massive anti @-@ fascist movement of the people , and it should be based principally upon the policy of self @-@ reliance and at the same time , not to slacken our efforts to obtain foreign aid ,
The Communist Party &apos;s Position in the National War
( This chapter &apos;s contents are similar to another essaypp 241 @-@ 264and it is deleted here in order to avoid repetition . )
The Convening of the Party &apos;s Seventh National Congress
I will now talk about the last problem , the problem of convening the Seventh Congress
Comrades , the National Congress of our Party has not been convened since the sixth one was held in 1928 .
Due to circumstances , it has been 10 years since we held a congress .
Last December , the political bureau meeting decided to make preparations for convening the Seventh Congress .
Due to incompletion of the preparatory work it will be difficult to hold it this year .
This enlarged general membership meeting should discuss the question of stepping up the preparatory work and decide on convening the congress in the near future .
The political significance of this congress will be very important .
It will sum up past experiences , mainly that of the war of resistance throughout the nation and the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front .
It will discuss the political situations domestically and internationally .
It will discuss how to further unite the entire nation , unite the Kuomintang , the Communist Party , and other parties and factions , and further consolidate and expand the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front .
Policy , methods , and plans on how to win
final victory in the war of resistance in the course of a protracted war and long @-@ term cooperation vill also be discussed .
We must discuss how to mobilize the working class and laboring people throughout the nation to take an even , more active part in the war of resistance .
How the Party can further its own unity and strengthen itself under the new situation should also be discussed so as to consolidate the relationship between itself and the Kuomintang and as well as the other parties and factions and the people throughout the nation in order to smoothly implement the general policy of the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front .
Besides these problems of politics and organizations , the Seventh National Congress should elect a new Central Committee , selecting many of the comrades in the entire Party with the most prestige and authority to become part of the committee in order to strengthen the leadership of the entire PartyTs work .
Comrades , since this congress has such great significance , all comrades , upon returning to their various areas to work after the closing of the sixth enlarged meeting of the general membership of the Party , should , on the basis of expanding and consolidating the Party &apos;s foundation carry out elections in a timely manner and in accordance with democratic methods so as to enable the best cadres who have the greatest trust and confidence of the Party members to have the opportunity to be elected as representatives to the congress , thereby bringing together under one roof the best representatives to the Seventh National Congress and ensure that the congress will be a success .
We believe that this National Congress will definitely be successful .
It will provide the most serious and powerful reply to the Japanese imperialist &apos;s war of aggression , make imperialist Japan tremble in fear in the face of our National Congress , and throw them back into the eastern sea .
The Chinese nation will be victorious .
My report ends here .

DIALECTIC MATERIALISM ( LECTURE OUTLINE )
&#91; Text &#93; Chapter I Idealism and Materialism
This chapter discusses the following problems :
( 1 ) Two opposing camps of philosophy ;
( 2 ) Distinction between idealism and materialism ;
( 3 ) Origin and development of idealism ; and
( 4 ) Origin and development of materialism .
( 1 ) Two Opposing Camps of Philosophy
The entire history of philosophy is the history of struggle and development of idealism and materialism , the two opposing schools of philosophy .
All philosophical thoughts and factions are variations of these two basic schools .
All philosophical theories are created by people belonging to a definite social class .
The consciousness of these people is historically determined by a definite social life .
All philosophical theories express the need of a definite social class and reflect the level of development of social productive force and the historical stage of man &apos;s knowledge of nature .
The fate of a philosophy is determined by the degree it satisfies the need of society .
The social origin of idealism and materialism lies in the social structure of class contradictions .
The original idealism was the product of ignorance of the primitive barbarian man .
Later , as productive forces developed , scientific knowledge @-@ also developed .
Consequently , idealism should have declined and been replaced by materialism .
However , from antiquity to modern times , idealism has not declined .
On the contrary , it has developed further and become a close rival of materialism .
The reason is that society is divided into classes .
On the one hand , the oppressing class cannot but develop and consolidate its idealism for its own interest .
On the other hand , the oppressed class , similarly , cannot but develop and consolidate
its materialism for its own interest .
Both idealism and materialism exist as tools of class struggle , and the war between the two schools of philosophy will continue until the elimination of classes .
In its process of development , idealism represents the ideology of the exploiting class and has a reactionary function .
Materialism is the world outlook of the revolutionary class .
In a class society , materialism grows and develops continuously in its struggle against the reactionary philosophyidealism .
For this reason the struggle between idealism and materialism always reflects the struggle between the interest of the reactionary class and that of the revolutionary class .
No matter whether a philosopher is conscious of it or not , his philosophic inclination is always influenced by the political orientation of the class to which he belongs .
Any inclination in philosophy always directly or Indirectly supports the basic political interest of the class the philosopher belongs .
In this sense , the implementation of a certain philosophical Inclination is a special form of the policy of the class the philosopher belongs .
The special characteristic of the Marxist philosophy , dialectic materialism , is to explain clearly the class attributes of all social consciousness ( including philosophy ) .
It openly declares its proletarian nature , wages a resolute struggle against idealism of the capitalist class , and subordinates its function to the general task of overthrowing the capitalist institution , establishing proletarian dictatorship , and building socialism .
In the present stage in China , the mission of philosophy is subordinated to the general task of overthrowing imperialism and semi- ^ -feudalism , thoroughly implementing the democracy of the bourgeois class , establishing a brand new Chinese Democratic Republic , and preparing to transform the present society to a socialist and Communist society with peaceful means .
Philosophical theories and political practices should be closely related .
( 2 ) Distinction Between Idealism and Materialism
Where is the basic difference between idealism and materialism ?
It lies in the opposite answers given by the two schools in regard to the basic problem of philosophy , that is , the problem of the relationship between spirit and matter ( the problem of the relationship between consciousness and existence ) .
Idealism considers spirit ( consciousness , concept , and subject ) as the origin of everything in the world and matter ( natural or social object ) as subordinate to spirit .
Materialism holds that matter exists independent of spirit , while spirit is only subordinate to matter .
From the opposite answers to this basic problem , diversified opinions arise on all other problems .
From the viewpoint of idealism , the world is probably a synthesis of our different kinds of senses , or it Is the spiritual process created by our or worldly rationality .
The external material world is viewed as an illusion , or an external shell of spiritual elements .
Human knowledge is viewed as subjective and a product of spirit .
Conversely , materialism holds that the unity , of universe lies In its material property .
Spirit ( consciousness ) Is one of the properties of
matter .
It occurs only when matter develops to a definite stage .
Nature , matter and the objective world exist outside.of spirit and independent of spirit .
Human knowledge is a reflection of the objective world .
( 3 ) Origin of Idealism and Its Development
Idealism considers that matter is a product of spirit .
It turns the real world upside down .
What is the .
origin of this philosophy , and where is the source of its development ?
As mentioned before , idealism occurred as a product of the ignorance of primitive man , but after the development of production the primary condition that enabled idealism to become a philosophical thought was the separation of physical and mental labor .
As a result of the development of social productivity , division of labor occurred in society .
Further development of division of labor produced people who devoted themselves exclusively to mental labor .
At a time when social productivity was relatively low , the separation of physical and mental labor was not complete .
But after the emergence of classes and private property , when exploitation became the foundation for the existence of the dominating class , great changes began .
Mental labor became a special privilege of the dominating class , while physical labor became the fate of the oppressed class .
The dominating class began to examine their own relationship with the oppressed class in a topsy @-@ turvy way .
They thought that , it was not the laborers who provided them with materials for living .
Instead , they thought , it was they who provided the laborers with materials for living .
For.this reason , they despised physical labor and generated the viewpoints of idealism .
Eliminating the distinction between physical and material labor is one of the conditions for eliminating the philosophy of idealism .
The social origin which enabled the philosophy of idealism to develop is mainly the fact.that this philosophy consciously expresses the interest of the exploiting class .
The superiority of the idealist philosophy in all cultural realms should be explained by this fact .
If the exploiting class did not exist , idealism would lose its social origin .
The final extinction of the philosophy of idealism will come only after the elimination of classes and the establishment of a Communist society .
We must look for the origin that accounts for the development and intensification of idealism and its ability to become a rival of materialism in the process of manfs knowledge .
When man uses concept in thinking , there is a possibility for him to slip into idealism .
When man thinks , he cannot but use concepts .
This will apt to make our knowledge split into two aspects .
In one aspect are the individual and special things and events .
In another aspect are the concepts of a general nature ( such as this judgment : &quot; Yenan is a city . &quot; ) The specific and the general are originally related and inseparable .
When they are detached , they are separated from the objective truth .
The objective truth demonstrates the consistency between the general and the specific .
Without the specific , the general does not exist .
Without the general , there can be no specific .
If we separate the general from the specific , then the general is considered the objective body and the specific is considered only a form of general existence .
This is the method used by all idealists .
They use consciousness , spirit , and concept to replace the objective substance which exists independent of man &apos;s consciousness .
With this as a starting point , the idealists stress the dynamic nature of human consciousness in social practice .
They are unable to point out the truth of materialism that consciousness is limited by matter .
Instead , they say that only consciousness is dynamic , while matter is nothing but a collective body of immobile things .
Driven by class motivations , the idealists use all methods to exaggerate the dynamism of consciousness and develop it one @-@ sidedly to such an extent that it is infinitely expanded in the mind to become a dominating thing .
Matter is covered up.and made subordinate to consciousness .
They affirm this artificially expanded thing as the general outlook of the universe , and even worship it as an idol or demigod .
Idealist economics excessively exaggerate the immaterial side of exchange , and elevates the status of the principle of supply and demand to that of the fundamental law of capitalism .
Many people saw the dynamic function of science in social life , but did not know that this function is ruled and limited by a definite social production relationship .
They therefore came to the conclusion that science is the motive force of society .
Idealist historians regard heroes as the creators of history .
Idealist politicians consider politics as an omnipotent thing .
Idealist militarists practice the principle of fighting @-@ to @-@ the @-@ death in war .
Idealist revolutionaries advocate Blanquism .
All these are exaggerations of subjective dynamism .
Our thinking cannot reflect the object all at once as a whole .
It is only an infinite , colorful , vivid and dialectic process of knowing things close to their reality .
Based on this characteristic of human thinking , the idealists exaggerate certain individual aspects of this process .
Unable to correctly reflect this process , they distort it .
Lenin said : &quot; Human knowledge is not developed along a straight line , but along a curve .
Any section of this curve can become an isolated and integral section of straight line .
This section of straight line can possibly lead you to confusion .
Linearity and one @-@ sidedness are &apos; not seeing the forest for the trees &apos; ; obstinacy , subjectivism , and subjective blindnessall these are the origins of idealist epistemology.11 &quot; Idealism one @-@ sidedly exaggerates one fragment or one aspect of the process of cognizance into a mysterious absolute thing divorced from amtter and divorced from nature .
It is correct to say that idealism is religious dogma . &quot;
Pre @-@ Marxist materialism ( mechanical materialism ) did not emphasize the dynamism of thinking in cognizance .
It only gave thinking a passive function , and regarded thinking as a mirror to reflect nature .
Mechanical materialism took a violent attitude toward idealism without paying attention to the origin of idealist epistemology .
Therefore , mechanical materialism could not prevail over idealism .
Only dialectic materialism correctly points out the dynamic nature of thinking and , at the same time , points ou- that thinking is limited by matter .
It points out that thinking occurs in the process of social practice and also dynamically directs practice .
Only this type of dialectical theory of &quot; unity between knowledge and practice &quot; can thoroughly prevail over idealism .
( 4 ) Origin of Materialism and Its Development
Recognition of the existence of external matter independent of consciousness is the.foundation of materialism .
This foundation is acquired by man through practice , the practice of labor and production .
The practice of class struggle and the practice of scientific experimentation enabled man to depart from superstition and fantasy ( idealism ) , to gradually recognize the nature of the world , and to reach materialism .
Primitive man , who could only use simple tools and yielded to the force of nature , was unable to explain the changes surrounding him .
Therefore , he asked help from the spirit .
This is the origin of religion and idealism .
In the long processes of production , man came in contact with nature surrounding him , acted on nature , changed nature , and secured things for clothing , food and shelter in order to make nature more suited to the interest of man .
This convinced man that matter does objectively exist .
In social life , relationships and influence occur between one man and another .
In class society , class struggle went on .
The oppressed class weighed the situation , estimated their strength and made plans .
When their struggle succeeded , they firmly believed that their opinion was not a product of imagination , but a reflection of the material world which objectively exists .
When the oppressed class failed in their struggle because of the adoption of wrong plans , and when they succeeded in their struggle after changing their plans , they began to understand that they could reach their goal only if their subjective plans were based on a correct knowledge of the material property and rules of the objective world .
The history of science proved to man the material property and regularity
of the world , and made him realize the uselessness of the fantasy of religion
and idealism , and finally accept the conclusion of materialism .
In short , in the long history of practicethe history of human struggle against nature , the &apos;history of class struggle , and the history of scienceman , for the necessity of living and struggle , thought about the reality of material and its rules , proved the correctness of the philosophy of materialism , and found the ideological tool for his own strugglethe philosophy of materialism .
As social production developed to a higher and higher degree , class struggle became more and more developed ; scientific knowledge further exposed the &quot; secrets &quot; of nature , the philosophy of materialism became more and more developed and consolidated ; gradually became able to liberate himself from the dual oppression of nature and society .
When it was necessary for the bourgeois class to struggle against the feudal class and before the proletariat had become a threat , the bourgeoisie also found and used materialism as a tool in their own struggle , and believed at one time that the things and events surrounding them were products of matter rather than products of spirit .
Not until they themselves became rulers and the struggle of the proletariat threatened their position did they give up this &quot; useless &quot; tool , and pick up another toolthe philosophy of idealism .
The proletarian class , the grave diggers for capitalism , is materialist by nature .
But , due to the fact that the proletarian class is the most advanced class in history , the materialism of the proletarian class is different from the materialism of the capitalist class .
The former is more thorough and more profound , characterized only by dialectics and not by mechanism .
The proletarian class absorbed the fruits of all practices in human history and , through their practice and their spokesmen and leadersMarx and Engelscreated dialectic materialism .
It maintains not only that matter exists independent of and separated from human consciousness , but also that matter is changing .
It thus becomes a completely systematic and totally new world outlook and methodology .
This is the philosophy of Marxism .
Chapter II Dialectic Materialism
This chapter discusses the following problems :
( 1 ) Dialectic materialism as a weapon of proletarian revolution ;
( 2 ) Relationship between the heritage of old philosophy and dialectic materialism ;
( 3 ) Consistency of outlook of the universe and methodology in dialectic materialism ;
( 4 ) The problem of object in philosophy ;
( 5 ) Theory of matter ;
( 6 ) Theory of movement ;
( 7 ) Theory of time and space ;
( 8 ) Theory of consciousness ;
( 9 ) Theory of reflection ;
( 10 ) Theory of truth ; and
( 11 ) Theory of practice .
The following is a &quot; brief discussion of our viewpoints on these problems .
( 1 ) Dialectic Materialism as a Weapon of Proletarian Revolution
This problem has already been discussed in Chapter I.
We shall talk about it briefly again .
Dialectic materialism represents the universal view of the proletarian class .
The proletarian class uses dialectic materialism as its spiritual weapon in
its struggle and as its philosophical basis for its various opinions .
Only when we view the world from the proletarian standpoint can we correctly and completely grasp dialectic materialism .
Only when , we start from this viewpoint can the real world be truly and objectively known .
This is due to , in one respect , the fact that the proletarian class is the most advanced and most revolutionary class ; and in another respect , the fact that dialectic materialism is the most correct and most revolutionary outlook of the universe and methodology in which a highly precise scientific characteristic is closely associated with a thorough and uncompromising revolutionary characteristic .
The proletarian class in China has -now shouldered the historical responsibility of carrying the democratic revolution of the bourgeois class .
It must adopt dialectic materialism as its spiritual weapon .
If dialectic materialism is accepted by the proletarian class , the Communist Party , and .all revolutionary elements who are willing to take a stand on the side of the vast proletarian class , they will have the most correct and the most revolutionary universal view and methodology , and they will be able to correctly understand the development and changes of the revolutionary movement correctly , propose correct revolutionary tasks , unite with their allies , defeat reactionary theories , take correct actions , avoid mistakes in their work , and reach the goal of liberating and rebuilding China .
Dialectic materialism is especially a required subject of study for those cadres who direct revolutionary movements because subjectivism and mechanism , the two erroneous theories and working methods , often lead cadres into wrong actions in violation of Marxism , and into wrong ways in revolutionary movements .
.In order to avoid and to correct this shortcoming , it is necessary for cadres to study dialectic materialism self @-@ consciously , and rearm their minds .
( 2 ) Relationship Between the Heritage of the Old Philosophy and Dialectic Materialism
Modern materialism is not a simple successor to the various old schools of philosophy .
It was born and developed in the struggle against the dominant philosophy of the past and in the struggle of freeing science from idealism and myth .
The Marxist philosophy , dialectic materialism , has not only inherited the best product of idealism , the fruits of Hegelian philosophy , but also overcome the idealism of that school of philosophy and materialistically transformed Hegel &apos;s dialectics .
Marxism is not only the continuation and consummation of all the past development of materialism , but also an opponent of the narrowness of all the old schools of materialism , that is , the mechanical and intuitive materialism ( mainly French materialism and Feuerbach materialism ) .
Marxist philosophy , dialectic materialism , took over the scientific heritage of the past culture and at the same time gave it a revolutionary transformation to become the most correct , the most revolutionary , and the most complete philosophical science unprecedented in history .
After the 4 May 1919 Movement , as the proletarian class of China consciously walked onto the political stage , and as the nation &apos;s scientific standard continued to rise , a Marxist philosophy movement developed .
However , during
the initial stage of China &apos;s materialist movement our understanding about dialectics was inadequate .
As a result , the capitalist mechanical materialism and the Deborin school &apos;s subjectivism predominated .
When the revolution of 1927 failed , our understanding of Marxism @-@ Leninism improved , and materialist dialectic thinking gradually developed .
Recently , due to the seriousness of national and social crises and due to the purge of philosophy in the Soviet Union , a broad movement of dialectic materialism began among the thinkers in China .
Due to the backwardness of Chinese society , the current dialectic materialism thinking in China is not a continuation or transformation of China &apos;s own philosophical heritage .
It came , rather , from learning Marxism @-@ Leninism * In order that dialectic materialism will take root and advance in China and will definitely guide the Chinese revolution toward an ultimate triumph , it is necessary to struggle against all existing obsolete philosophy , to raise a banner of criticism on the ideological front all .
over the country , and thereby to liquidate the philosophical heritage of ancient China .
( 3 ) Consistency of the Outlook of the Universe and Methodology in Dialectic Materialism
Dialectic materialism is the proletarian outlook of the universe , and at the same time it is also the method used by the proletarian class to know the surrounding world as well as the method for revolutionary action .
It is a unity of the outlook of the universe and methodology .
The idealist Marxist revisionists think that the substance of dialectic materialism lies in its &quot; method . &quot; They sever method from the general philosophical outlook of the universe , and sever dialectics from materialism .
They don &apos;t understand Marxist methodologydialecticswhich is not like Hegelian idealist dialectis , but materialist dialectics .
Marxist methodology can never be separated from Marxist outlook of the universe .
On the other hand , mechanical materialism not only views Marxist philosophy as a general philosophical outlook of the universe without its dialectics , but also regards this kind of outlook as the conclusion of mechanical natural science .
They do not understand that Marxist materialism is not simple materialism , but dialectic materialism .
These two separated views of Marxist philosophy are wrong .
Dialectic materialism is a unity of outlook of the universe and methodology .
( 4 ) The Problem of the Object of Dialectic MaterialismWhat Does Materialist Dialectics Study ?
Lenin considered materialist dialectics ( as a Marxist philosophy ) as a study of the laws of development of the objective world , as well as a study of the laws of development of cognizance ( which reflects the objective world through various categories in dialectics ) .
He said that logic is not an external formal study of thinking ; it is rather a study concerning the law of development of all material , natural and spiritual things .
In other words , logic is the total , summation , and conclusion of human knowledge about the world .
Although Lenin emphasized the significance of materialist dialectics as a
general scientific methodology , he did this because dialectics is the conclusion drawn from the history of our cognizance about the world .
Hence he said : &quot; Dialectics is the history of cognizance . &quot;
The above is Lenin &apos;s definition of materialist dialectics as a science and its objectives .
What he means is as follows : First , just as any other science , materialist dialectics has its object of study .
The object is the most general laws of development of nature , history , and human thinking .
The task of materialist dialectics is not to think from our head the relationship between various phenomena , but to observe the relationship between the various phenomena from the phenomena themselves .
This viewpoint of Lenin &apos;s is basically different from that of the members of the minority faction of the idealists who regard category ( divorced in fact from specific science or specific knowledge ) as the object of study of materialist dialectics .
This is because of the fact that the members of the minority faction of idealists attempt to establish a philosophical system of categories isolated from the development of human knowledge about the reality of epistemology , history , social science and natural science .
By so doing , they have in fact abandoned materialist dialectics .
Second , the various branches of science ( mathematics , mechanics , chemistry , physics , biology , economics and other natural sciences and social sciences ) are for the study of the various aspects of the material world and its development .
Therefore , the principles of the various sciences are narrowly limited by each specific realm of study .
But materialist dialectics is not so .
It summarizes , draws.conclusions about , processes and generalizes all the valuable contents of all specific branches of science and other scientific knowledge of mankind .
Thus , the concepts , judgments , and principles of materialist dialectics are extremely broad ( including the most general laws of all sciences , and hence including the substance of the material world ) .
In this respect , it is an outlook of the universe .
On the other hand , materialist dialectics is the foundation of true scientific logic and epistemology liberated from all empty thinking , clericalism , and metaphysics .
Therefore , it is also the only realistic objective methodology for the study of specific sciences .
It is further clear why we say that materialist dialectics or dialectic materialism Is the unity of the outlook of the universe and methodology .
So the mistakes of those who distort and vulgarize Marxism and deny Marxism as a philosophy can be understood .
Concerning the problem of the object of philosophy , Marx , Engels and Lenin all opposed separating philosophy from reality or making philosophy something independent of substance .
They pointed out the inevitability of philosophy growing out of actual life and based upon the analysis of actual life and actual relationships ..
They specially opposed using logical concepts and logic as the objects of study as practiced by the formalists and members of the minority faction of the idealists .
Marx , Engels , and Lenin all interpreted materialist dialectics as a theory concerning development .
Engels regarded materialist dialectics as &quot; a theory discussing the general principle of development of nature , society and thinking . &quot; Lenin considered materialist dialectics as &quot; the most multI @-@ faceted , the richest and the most profound theory of development . &quot; They all considered &quot; the formulas of all principles of
development offered by other schools of philosophy as narrow , without substance , and severed from the process of development of nature and society . &quot; ( Quotation from Lenin ) The reason by materialist dialectics is called the most multi @-@ faceted , the richest , and the most profound theory of development is nothing but that it reflects the contradictions and the leaping nature in the process of natural and social changes in the most multi @-@ faceted , the richest and the most profound way .
There is another problem to be resolved about the object of philosophy ; that is , the consistency between dialectics and logic .
Lenin emphatically pointed out the identity among dialectics , logic , and epistemology , saying that .this is &quot; an eKtremely important problem . &quot; He said : &quot; These three terms are superfluous .
They indicated only one thing . &quot; He was fundamentally opposed to those Marxist revisionists who treat these three theories as entirely independent of one another .
Materialist dialectics is the only scientific epistemology , and the only scientific logic .
It deals with the growth of our cognizance of the external world and the development of such cognizance ; the transformation from not knowing to knowing and from not completely knowing to completely knowing ; and reflection of the laws of development of nature and society which deepens enhances daily in the mind of mankind .
This is the unity between materialist dialectics and epistemology .
Materialist dialectics studies the most general laws of development of the objective world , and reflections of the most developed form of the objective world in our mind .
This is how materialist dialectics studies the process of development of realistic things , and the laws of occurrence , disappearance and mutual transformation of phenomena .
At the same time , it also studies the phenomena of the human mind which reflects the laws of development of the objective world .
This is the unity of materialist dialectics and logic .
In order to understand the relationship between dialectics , logic , and epistemology thoroughly , we shall examine in the following how dialectics resolves the problem of mutual relationship between logic and history .
Engels said : &quot; As far as the method of thinking of all schools of philosophy is concerned , the advantage of Hegel * s method is its extremely rich sense of history .
Although Hegel &apos;s form is abstract and idealistic , the development of his thinking parallels the development of world history .
Moreover , history is in fact a verification of our thinking .
History often proceeds rapidly in a complex manner .
Because of this , if we obey history , we must not only pay attention to a lot of unimportant material , but also interrupt our train of thought .
This is the only suitable method and this is the logical method .
This logical method is still fundamentally the historical method except for the elimination of the form of history and its accidental characteristic . &quot; This viewpoint of &quot; unity of logical development and historical development &quot; was given full attention by Marx , Engels , and Lenin .
&quot; The category of logic is the simplification of the innumerable characteristics of external existence and activities . &quot; Category is a separated segment which helps us to know the links of different networks .
&quot; The activity of human practice is a repeated
application of human consciousness to various formulas of logic .
Then , these formulas acquire the significance of an axiom .
It takes thousands and millions of times of repeated practice for a theoretical &apos; formula to be stabilized in human consciousness .
All these formulas have some perpetual prejudice because they are the results of thousands and millions times of practice before they take on the characteristics of axioms . &quot; The above sayings of Lenin point out the fact that the characteristics of materialist dialectical logic are not the same as those of formal logic , which looks upon principles and categories as empty things existing independently from contents and unrelated to contents .
Materialist dialectical logic is also different from Hegelian logic .
Unlike Hegelian logic which regarded category as concepts isolated from and independent of the material world , materialist dialectical logic treats concepts as manifestations of material movements reflected and transplanted to our mind , and then processed by our brain .
Holding the @-@ view of unity between existence and thinking , Hegel treated the unity among dialectics , logic and epistemology in the same way as unity in idealism .
On the contrary , in Marxist philosophy , the unity , of dialectics , logic and epistemology is built on the foundation of materialism .
Only if materialism is used to resolve the problem of the relationship between existence and thinking , and only if the viewpoint of the reflection.theory is taken , can the problem of dialectics , logic , and epistemology be thoroughly resolved .
The best model of using dialectical materialism to resolve the problem of the mutual relationships between logical things and historical things is Karl Marx &apos;x &quot; Capital . &quot; It discusses the historical development of capitalist society , and at the same time discusses the logical development of that society .
What &quot; Capital &quot; analyzes is the dialectics of the development of various economic categories reflected by the growth , development , and extinction of capitalist society .
The materialist solution of this problem is based upon using the materialist objective history as the foundation , and using concept and category as the reflection of this realistic history .
The unity of logic and history of capitalism and the unity of logic and epistemology of capitalist society are illustriously expressed in &quot; Capital . &quot; From &quot; Capital , &quot; we can understand a little bit about the unity among dialectics , logic and epistemology .
The above concerns the problem of the object of dialectic materialism .
( 5 ) Theory of Matter
Marxism took over and developed the line of materialism in philosophy .
It correctly resolved the problem of the relationship between thinking and existence ; that is , it thoroughly and materialistically pointed out the materialistic character of the world , the objective existence of matter , and the fact that matter is the origin of consciousness ( or the reliance of consciousness on existence ) .
The acceptance of matter being the origin of consciousness is based on the premises of the materialistic character of the world and its objective existence .
The first condition for one to belong to the camp of materialism
is his acceptance of the existence of the materialistic world independent of man &apos;s consciousnessthat is , the world existed before the appearance of mankind , and it existed after the appearance of mankind .
Acceptance of this point is the basic premises for any scientific study .
How can we prove this point ?
There are many proofs .
Man is in contact with the external world at all the times , and must use cruel ways to deal with the oppression and resistance of the external world ( nature and society ) .
Man can and should overcome these oppressions and resistance .
The human social practice demonstrated in the historical development of human society is the best proof .
China does not doubt the objective existence of Japanese imperialism which invaded China , nor the objective existence of the Chinese people .
The students of the Anti @-@ Japanese Military and Political University also never doubted the objective existence of the university and the students themselves .
These things are all material things which exist independent of and separate from.our consciousness .
All these are the basic viewpoints of materialism , or the philosophy of materialism .
The materialistic viewpoint in philosophy is different from the materialistic viewpoint in natural science .
If we say materialistic viewpoint in philosophy is to point out the objective existence of matter , and that the so @-@ called matter is the entire world which is separated from man &apos;s consciousness and exists independently ( this world acts upon man &apos;s senses to cause man &apos;s feelings and to cause man to have reflection from feelings ) , then this statement is absolute , and will never change .
The materialistic viewpoint in natural science concerns the study of the structure of matter , such as the former atomic theory and the current electronic theory .
Such statements change with the advance of science and are relative .
To use dialectic materialism to distinguish the materialistic viewpoint in philosophy and that in natural science is a necessary condition for the implementation of the materialistic viewpoint , in philosophy .
This point has a great significance in the struggle with idealism and mechanical materialism .
On the bases of the theory of electrons , the materialists smashed the absurd theory about the extinction of matter .
Those who held this absurd view did not know that the advancement of scientific knowledge concerning the structure of matter is sufficient proof of the correctness of the theory of matter in dialectic materialism .
As a result of modern , discoveries in natural science and the discovery of electron theory , it has been proven that certain material attributes exhibited in old material concepts ( such as weight , hardness , impenetrability , inertia , etc . ) exist only in certain material forms , and do not exist in other material forms .
This fact breaks down the narrowness and one @-@ sidedness of the old materialist view toward matter , and proves the correctness of dialectic materialism which accepts the materialistic characteristics and the objective existence of matter .
The materialist view of dialectic materialism sees the unity of the material world from its multiple characteristics , i.e. , the unity of matter &apos;s multiple characteristics .
This type of concept of matter does not contradict at all the perpetual movement
or change from one from to another .
Ether , electrons , atoms , molecules . , crystalline cells , social phenomena , mental phenomena , etc . , represent various stages of development of matter .
They are temporary states in the history of the development of matter .
Scientific studies bring about profound discoveries of all kinds of material states ( the discovery of the multiple characteristics of matter ) , and these discoveries only enrich the contents of - the concept of matter of dialectic materialism .
How can there be any contradictions ?
It is necessary to make a distinction between the concept of matter in philosophy and that in natural science , because the former is broad and the latter narrow , but they are not contradictory .
The broad concept of matter includes the narrow concept of matter .
The concept of matter of dialectic materialism does not recognize any non @-@ material things in the world ( independent and spiritual things ) .
Matter exists permanently and universally in time and space .
If we say that there is in this world a thing which &quot; has always been so , &quot; or which &quot; is so everywhere &quot; ( as far as its consistency is concerned ) , then that thing is the so @-@ called objectively existing matter in philosophy .
When consciousness is viewed from thorough materialism ( that is from the viewpoint of materialist dialectics ) , it is nothing but a state of matter , a form of material movement , a special characteristic of the material brain , and that kind of special characteristic of the material brain reflected from matter outside of consciousness to consciousness .
Thus , our distinction between matter and consciousness , and our setting up the two opposing each other are conditional .
That is to say , the distinction is meaningful only in epistemology because consciousness or thought is only an attribute of matter ( brain ) .
Therefore , the opposition between cognizance and existence doesn &apos;t go beyond this .
This type of opposition between the subject and the object has no meaning beyond the realm of epistemology .
If cognizance is set up opposing matter outside the realm of epistemology , we are revolting against materialism .
In this world there is only matter and its various manifestations .
The subject itself is also matter .
This is what is meant by the material attributes of the world ( matter is perpetual and universal ) , the objective reality of matter , and matter is the origin of consciousness .
In short , matter is everything in the world .
We say &quot; all belongs to Ssu @-@ ma I , &quot; and &quot; all belongs to matter.11 This is the principle of unity of the world .
The above is the concept of matter in dialectical materialism .
( 6 ) Theory of Motion ( Theory of Development )
The first basic principle of dialectic materialism is its acceptance of the material nature of the world , the objective reality of matter , and matter being the origin of consciousness .
This unity theory of the world has been discussed in the aforementioned theory of matter .
The second basic principle of dialectic materialism is its theory of motion ( or the theory o development ) .
It acknowledges that motion is the form of material existence , i.e. , the inner attributes of matter .
Motion is an expression of the multiple attributes of matter .
This is the theory of development of the world .
A combination of the development theory of the world and
the aforementioned unity theory of the world forms the entire outlook of the universe of dialectic materialism .
The world is nothing but an infinite development of the material world ( or the material world is developing without limit ) .
The concept of motion of dialectic materialism will not permit ( 1 ) mental motion separated from matter , ( 2 ) mental matter separated from motion , or ( 3 ) simplification of material motion .
The concept of motion is established after a resolute struggle with idealistic , metaphysical and mechanical viewpoints .
First of all , the theory of motion of dialectic materialism is opposed to idealism in philosophy and theism in religion .
The basic characteristic of all idealism and theism is their denial of the material unity of the world .
They imagine that the motion and development of the entire world are without matter , or there is no matter at the very beginning .
It is , rather , the result of spiritual action or the power of God .
The German idealist philosopher Hegel believed that the actual world was developed from the so @-@ called &quot; concept of the world . &quot; In China , believers of Chou I and Li Hsueh of the Sung and Ming Dynasties all expressed idealistic concepts of the development of the universe .
The Christians say that God created the world .
Buddhists and fetishists in China ascribe the development of everything in the universe to spiritual power .
All these views separating human thinking from matter are incompatible with dialectic materialism .
Not only idealists and clergymen , but all the materialists before Marx , and all the current anti @-@ Marxist mechanical materialists maintain materialistic theory of motion when they talk about natural science .
But when they talk about social phenomena , they no longer adhere to materialistic principles , and ascribe everything to spiritual reasons .
Dialectic materialism resolutely refutes all these erroneous concepts of motion , points out their limitationsthe limitations of their class status and the limitation of scientific development , and builds its own concept of motion thoroughly on materialism from the standpoint of the proletarian class and based on the most developed scientific standard .
First of all , the dialectic materialists points out that motion is the form of existence of matter , and is an inner characteristic of matter ( not due to external force ) .
It is just as impossible to imagine motion without matter as to imagine matter without motion .
They set up a materialistic concept of motion sharply opposed to the idealist or theist concepts of motion .
If we observe matter isolated from motion , it will be a metaphysical theory of a stationary universe , or the theory of absolute equilibrium .
Those who subscribe to this theory maintain that matter is unchanging , and that there is no such thing as development in matter .
They believe that an absolute standstill is the general state of matter , or the primitive state of matter .
Dialectic materialism firmly opposes this point of view .
It believes that motion is the most common form of material existence , and an inner and inseparable attribute of matter .
All static and equilibrium states have only relative meaning , while motion is absolute .
Dialectic materialism acknowledges that all material may have the possibility of being in a stationary state or a state of equilibrium .
It also believes that this is the most important
condition for distinguishing matter and , therefore , is also the most important condition for distinguishing life .
( Engels ) However , dialectic materialism believes that being in a stationary state or in a state of equilibrium is only one of the elements of motion , or a kind of special condition of motion .
The mistake of observing matter without reference to motion lies in the exaggeration of the elements of standstill or equilibrium .
These elements are wrongly used to cover up or to substitute for the entirety .
A special condition of motion is generalized to become absolute .
An ancient Chinese metaphysical thinker had a favorite saying : &quot; Heaven does not change ; reason does not change . &quot; His theory is one of stationary universe .
Although the followers of this saying acknowledge the changes in universe and social phenomena , they deny these changes as changes of matter itself .
In their eyes , the substance of the universe and society is forever unchanging .
The main reason for their thinking is their class limitation .
If the feudal landlord class acknowledges that the substance of the universe and society is moving and developing , it would be like theoretically declaring their own death sentence .
The philosophy of all reactionary forces is always a motion @-@ less philosophy .
In view of the principle of development of the world , the revolutionary class and the people advocated for the transformation of this society and world .
Their philosophy is dialectic materialism .
Moreover , dialectic materialism does not accept simplification of the concept of motion , or reduce all motion to one formthe form of mechanical motion .
This is the characteristic of the old materialistic concept of motion .
The old materialism ( French materialism of the 17th and 18th century and the German Feuerbach materailism of the 19th century ) accepted the permanent existence and permanent movement ( unlimited movement ) of matter , but it was confined to a metaphysical outlook of the universe .
Not only that their social viewpoint reflected a viewpoint of idealist development , even in natural science they ascribed the unity of material world to a certain one @-@ sided characteristic , or to one form of motionmechanical motion .
The cause of this type of motion is external force .
It is a motion like that of a machine which is pushed by an external force .
They do not explain matter of motion from internal causes and the multiple nature of relationships .
They explain motion simply from external form they have discovered , or from external reasons .
In this way , the multiple characteristics of the world are lost .
They explain all motions in the world as a change in location and a decrease or increase in quantity .
Motion is described as a phenomenon of matter being at one location during a certain moment of time and at another location during another moment .
If there is a change , it is only a change in numerical increase or decrease .
There is no change in characteristics and all changes are cyclical and will repeatedly produce the same result .
Dialectic materialism , is at odds with this .
It considers motion not as simple displacement or cyclical motion .
But as infinite varieties of matter .
Motion is looked upon as transformation of matter from one form to another , the unification and motion of matter in the world .
Engels said : &quot; All high @-@ level forms of motion are inevitably associated with the form of mechanical ( external or molecular ) motion .
For example , if there is no change in heat or electricity , chemical reactions will be impossible .
If there is no mechanical
( molecular ) , heat , electrical and chemical changes , organic life will be impossible .
This , of course , cannot be denied .
But if there exists some form of low @-@ level motion , they cannot include the substance of major forms of motion under various conditions . &quot; These words are absolutely in conformity with reality .
Even if we consider only the simple mechanical motions , we cannot explain them from the metaphysical viewpoint .
We should know that all forms of motion are dialectical , even though their dialectical contents and their multi @-@ faceted nature may be greatly different .
Thus , mechanical motion is still dialectic motion .
When we say that a body &quot; is &quot; at a certain location at a certain moment , that body is , in fact , &quot; at &quot; a certain location , and yet , at the same time , &quot; not at &quot; that certain location at that particular moment .
The so @-@ called &quot; being &quot; at a certain location and the so @-@ called &quot; immobile &quot; state are but special situations of motion .
The body is in fact in motion .
Matter moves within a limited time and within a limited space .
Matter is continuously overcoming the limitations in order to go out of fixed time and space to become an unceasing flow of motion .
Mechanical motion is only one form of motion of matter .
In the actual world , it does not exist absolutely independent , and it is always related to other forms of motion .
From heat , chemical reaction , light , and electricity to organic and social phenomena , all of them are special forms of motion .
At the turn of the 20th century , the greatest achievement of natural science was the discovery of the principle of motion transfer .
It pointed out that the motion of matter is always transforming from one form to another .
After transformation , the new form and the old form are substantially different .
The reason for material transfer is internal and not external .
The transfer is not caused by external mechanical drive , but by the struggle within the matter itself between two mutually contradictory elements of different nature .
Due to the discovery of this law of motion transfer , dialectic materialism is able to expand the theory of material unity in the world to the history of nature and science .
The world is observed not only as a matter in perpetual motion , but also as matter advancing from a lower form of motion to a higher form of motion .
The world is thus observed as a development as well as a process .
In other words , &quot; the unity of the material world is a process of development . &quot; In this way , the cyclical theory of old materialism is destroyed .
Dialectic materialism observes the form of motion of nature and society in a profound way and in its numerous aspects .
It considers that the process of development of the world as an entity is perpetual ( with no beginning and no end ) , but at the same time the form of the specific motion in each historical process is temporary ( with a beginning and an end ) .
This is to say that it occurs under a definite condition and disappears under a definite condition .
It believes that the process of development of the world from a lower form of motion to a higher form of motion demonstrates both its historical and temporary characteristics .
But at the same time , no one form of motion is in a perpetual long stream ( a long stream with no beginning and no end ) .
Based on the principle of opposition and struggle ( the reason for motion ) , the form of each motion always moves to a higher level .
It moves straight forward , but as far as each individual form of motion is concerned ( or as far as each specific process of development is concerned ) , = the motion may change its direction , or may be backward .
When the advancing motion is combined with the retreating motion , the resulting motion is a complex helical motion .
The new form of motion occurs as an opposite to the old form of motion , but at the same time the new form of motion preserves
many elements of the old form of motion .
The new things grows out of the old .
New forms , new characteristics and new attributes emerge from the disruption of continuity , or from a break @-@ through , but the link and the mutual relationship between things and events cannot be absolutely destroyed .
Finally , dialectic materialism believes that the world has no end .
This is so not only in its entity , but also in its parts .
Are not electrons and atoms the same in demonstrating a complex and endless world ?
The basic form of motion of matter also determines the various subjects of natural and social sciences .
Dialectic materialism observes the development of the world as a forward motion from an inorganic through an organic to the highest form of matter ( society ) .
The relationship arising from this form of motion becomes the foundation of the corresponding sciences ( inorganic science , organic science , and social science ) .
Engels said : &quot; The various kinds of science analyzes a special form of motion or the mutual relationship of a series of forms of motion .
Thus classification of science is to arrange and classify various motions according to the original order of motion .
Only on this point can classification be meaningful . &quot;
The entire world includes human society and the motions of matter in various forms .
Therefore , we cannot forget the various forms of motion of matter .
There is no so @-@ called &quot; matter in general , &quot; or &quot; motion in general.11 In this world , there are only concrete matter and motion in various forms .
&quot; Matter and motion are only simple terms .
In these terms we include all things and events sensed by us according to their common characteristics . &quot; ( Engels )
The above is the theory of motion of the world in dialectic materialism or the principle of world development .
This thinking is the essence of Marxist philosophy .
It is the proletarian outlook of the universe and methodology .
If all the proletarian revolutionaries use this explicit science as a weapon , they will understand this world and can rebuild this world .
( 7 ) Theory of Time and Space
Motion is a form of material existence .
Space and time .are also forms of material existence .
Moving matter exists in time and space , and the material existence of time and space is the premises of the motion of matter itself .
Time and space cannot be separated from matter .
&quot; Matter exists in space &quot; is to say that matter itself has the characteristic of expansion .
The material world is a world in which there exists the characteristic of expansion .
This is not to say that matter is placed in a non @-@ material empty space .
Space and time are not independent non @-@ material things .
They are not subjective forms of our senses , but forms of existence of the objective world .
They do not exist outside of matter ; nor does matter exist outside of them .
Regarding space and time as a form of material existence is a thoroughly materialistic view .
This concept of space and time is basically opposite to the following idealistic concept of space and time :
( 1 ) Kantian concept of space and time : Space and time are not regarded as objective reality , but objective forms of intuition .
( 2 ) Hegelian concept of space and time : The concept of developing space and time is approaching absolute concept .
( 3 ) Machian concept of space and time : Time and space are different kinds of senses , and &quot; tools for harmonizing experience . &quot;
All these idealistic viewpoints do not accept the objective reality of time and space .
They do not accept the fact that the concept of space of time , during its own development , reflects the form of materialistic existence .
These erroneous theories have been refuted by dialectic materialism one by one .
On the problem of space and time , dialectic materialism must not only struggle with those idealistic theories , but also struggle with mechanical materialism , especially Newton &apos;s theory of mechanics which regards space as an immobile , , empty frame with no relationship to time , and puts matter into this empty frame .
Opposing this theory , dialectic materialism points out that our concept of space is developing .
&quot; Aside from moving matter , there is nothing else in the world .
If moving matter is not in space and time , there will be no possibility of motion .
Man &apos;s concept of space and time is relative , but when all these relative concepts are put together , they become absolute truth .
These relative concepts are developing uninterruptedly along the line of absolute truth , and are approaching closer and closer to absolute truth everyday .
ManTs changing concept about space and time can never overthrow the objective reality of the two .
This is similar to the fact that the changing character of scientific knowledge about the form of motion and matter cannot overthrow the objective reality of the external world . &quot; ( Lenin ) The above is the theory of time and space of dialectic materialism .
( 8 ) Theory of Consciousness
Dialectic materialism maintains that knowledge is a product of mattert a form of development of matter , and a special characteristic of a definite state of matter .
This materialistic and historical theory of consciousness is basically opposed to the viewpoints of all idealists and mechanical materialists concerning this problem .
According to Marx , consciousness originally develops from the inorganic world which has no consciousness to the animal world which has a low level of consciousness , and finally to mankind which has a high level of consciousness .
The high level of consciousness is inseparable not only from the physiological development of the high nervous system , but also from the social development of labor and production .
Marx and Engels have emphatically pointed out the dependence of consciousness upon the development of material production and the relationship between consciousness and human language .
The so @-@ called consciousness is a special characteristic of a definite form of matter which constitutes a complex nervous system .
This kind of nervous system can only occur in a high stage of natural evolution .
In the entire inorganic , vegetative and low animal world , there is no possibility for consciousness to occur internally as well as externally , that is , the possibility of self @-@ reflection , or the possibility of understanding the process of self @-@ reflection .
The objective physiological process in our nervous system parallels the subjective expression which , internally , takes the form of consciousness .
To objective things , this physiological process is a process of certain matter , but to the material body equipped with a brain this process is , at the same time , subjective psychological behavior .
There is no such thing as the spirit of the substance of a special thinking .
There is only the matter for thinkingthe brain .
This matter for thinking is a matter of special quality .
It develops to a high degree along with the development of language in the social life of mankind .
This kind of matter possesses the ability to think as its special characteristica characteristic that other matters do not possess .
However , the vulgar materialists maintain that thinking is a matter derived from the brain .
This viewpoint distorts our concept in regard to this problem .
It is necessary to know that thinking , emotion , and conscious behavior are not things which have such characteristics as weight , expansion , etc .
Consciousness , weight and expansion are different characteristics of the same matter .
Consciousness is an inner state of matter in motion , and reflects the special characteristic of the life process which occurs in moving matter .
This special characteristic cannot be separated from the process of objective nervous function , but is also the same as that process .
If the two are confused , the special characteristic of consciousness is obliterated .
This is the viewpoint of the vulgarized materialism .
Similarly , the mechanical theory of the fake Marxism agrees with the opinion of certain capitalist rightists in the field of psychology .
They , in fact , obliterate consciousness .
They consider consciousness , a physiological process , as a special characteristic of a high @-@ level substance , without seeing that consciousness is a product of social practice of mankind .
They equate the subject with the object , and replace both with one @-@ sided mechanical objective world .
This viewpoint which confuses consciousness with physiological process is hardly different from eliminating the basic problem of thinking and existence in philosophy .
Menshevik idealism attempts to use a compromising theory to replace Marxist epistemology .
It harmonizes materialism with idealism , using the &quot; alliance &quot; of objectivism and subjectivism to oppose the principle of dialectics .
But their principle is neither mechanical objectivism , nor idealistic subjectivism , but the principle of concrete objective and subjective history .
There is also the strange theory of Plekhanov who maintained that matter is alive .
His remark &quot; rock also has consciousness &quot; fully expresses his opinion
that consciousness does not occur in the process of development of matter , but exists in all matter at the very beginning .
Later , it exists in low @-@ level organic bodies and man , different only in degrees .
This type of anti @-@ historical opinion is also basically opposed to the viewpoint of dialectic materialism which regards consciousness as possessing material characteristics .
Only the materialist theory of consciousness is the correct thought regarding the problem of consciousness .
( 9 ) Theory of Reflection
To a thorough materialist , just regarding matter as the origin of consciousness is not enough .
One has to accept that matter can be known to consciousness ,
Concerning the problem as to whether or not matter can be known , it is a complex problem , so complex that all the old philosophical schools were unable to resolve it .
Only dialectic materialism can correctly resolve this problem .
The position of dialectic materialism is opposed to the non @-@ cognizable theory , and different from the blunt theory of realism .
Hume and Kant &apos;s non @-@ cognizable theory separates the cognizing subject from the object .
It believes that it is impossible to go beyond the limits of the subjectan unsurpassable ditch between the &quot; self @-@ existing &quot; matter and its image .
Machfs reality theory ; equates the object with feelings , maintaining that truth has established its complete form in feelings .
At the same time , Machists do not understand that feeling is the result of external action .
Nor do they understand the positive function of the subject during the process of cognizance , that is , the transformation work done by external action in the sense organs and the brain ( or the formal expression of image and perception ) .
Only the reflection theory of dialectic materialism affirmatively answered the question of cognizability , and this answer becomes the &quot; soul &quot; of Marxist epistemology .
This theory points out that our images and percepts are not only induced by objective things , but also reflects them .
It also points out that images and percepts are neither products of the voluntary development of subjective bodies as the idealists say , nor symbols of objective things as said by those who maintain that nothing is cognizable .
Such images and percepts are reflections of objective things , photographs , or copies .
Objective truth exists independent of subjective bodies .
Although reflected in our feelings and percepts , objective truth does not take a complete form immediately .
The form is completed step by step .
It is a mistake to think that objective truth has taken a completed form in our feelings .
Truth is gradually acquired .
The blunt theory of reality is wrong .
Although objective truth does not take the completed form all at once in our feelings and percepts , it is by no means non @-@ cognizable .
The reflection theory of dialectic materialism opposes the theory of non @-@ cognizability .
It believes that consciousness can reflect objective truth during the process of cognizance .
The process of cognizance is a complicated one during which the unknown &quot; self @-@ existing thing , &quot; as it is reflected in our image and percept , becomes &quot; my thing . &quot; Feelings and thoughts are not what separate us from the external world as Kant said .
They are , in fact , links between us and the external world .
Feelings and thoughts are reflections of the external objective world .
Thoughts ( images and percepts ) are nothing but &quot; material things that have appeared and transformed in man &apos;s brain . &quot; ( Marx ) During the process of cognizance , the material world becomes more intimately , more accurately , more many @-@ sidedly , and more profoundly reflected in our cognizance .
To wage a two @-@ front struggle against Machism and Kantism is the task of Marx epistemology .
The dialectic materialist reflection theory maintains that our ability of knowing the objective world is limitless .
This is exactly .opposed to the opinion of those who believe that human ability to know is limited .
However , we are not close to the absolute truth .
Every time , we come to a line defined by history .
Lenin said : &quot; The approach of our knowledge to the objective absolute truth is limited by history , but the existence of this truth is absolute , and the fact that we are continuously getting closer to the truth is also absolute .
The external form of a picture is historically conditional , b &apos;ut the existence of the objective reality which is the model .of that picture is absolute .
We accept the fact that man &apos;s knowledge is limited by historical conditions and that truth cannot be acquired once and for all , but we are not those who believe that things are not cognizable .
We do not accept that truth can be completed in the historical movement of man &apos;s cognizance . &quot; Lenin also said : &quot; Let us not understand the reflection of nature in manTs thoughts in a rigid and absolute way .
Cognizance is not motionless , or without contradictions .
Cognizance is perpetually in the process of motion , that is , the perpetual process of movement of the occurrence of contradictions and the resolution of contradictions . &quot; The movement of cognizance is a complicated movement full of contradictions .
This is the opinion of the dialectic materialistic epistemology .
In epistemology , all philosophies reflect the historical viewpoint , and none regards cognizance as a process .
All these viewpoints are therefore narrow .
The narrowness of the theory of experience creates a gap between feeling and percept .
The narrowness of rationalism causes percepts separated from feeling .
Only dialectic materialism which regards cognizance as a process ( the theory of reflection ) thoroughly eliminates this kind of narrowness and places cognizance in a materialistic and dialectic perspective .
The reflection theory points out that the process of reflection is not not limited to feelings and images .
It also exists in thoughts ( in abstract concepts ) .
Cognizance is therefore a moving process from feeling to thinking .
Lenin once said : &quot; Cognizance which reflects nature , is not a simple , direct , and total reflection .
It is a formation process of many abstract thoughts , concepts , etc . &quot;
Meanwhile , Lenin also pointed out : &quot; The cognizance process from feeling to thinking is a flying and leaping action . &quot; On this point , Lenin precisely
clarifies the experience and rationality elements in cognizance and the viewpoint of dialectic materialism concerning their mutual relationship .
Many philosophers do not understand that the movement of cognizance is a sudden change occurring in the moving process from feeling to thinking ( from image to concept ) .
Therefore , to understand this sudden leaping change produced from contradictions is to understand the dialectic unity concerning the unity of feeling and thinking .
This is the most essential element for understanding the substance of LeninTs reflection theory .
( 10 ) Theory of Truth
Truth is objective , relative , and absolute .
This is the materialist dialectic theory of truth .
First of all , truth is objective .
Accepting the reality of matter and the opinion that matter is the origin of consciousness is the same as accepting truth being objective .
That is to say , the objectively existing material world is the only source of our knowledge or concepts , and there is no other source.- Only idealists deny the independent existence of the material world separated from man &apos;s consciousnessthis is the basic principle of idealism .
They maintain that knowledge or concepts are produced by the subject body , and the object body is unnecessary .
Therefore , they accept subjective truth and deny objective truth .
This does not conform to facts .
Any knowledge or any concept which does not reflect the regularity of the objective world is not scientific .
It is not objective truth , it is only subjective , self @-@ deceiving superstition or delusion .
The purpose of mankind is to change the environment .
All practical actions , whether they are productive or not , are commanded by thoughts ( knowledge ) .
If these thoughts do not coincide with objective regularity , then the latter is .not reflected in the brain of man .
If the objective regularity did not form the contents of man &apos;s thoughts or knowledge , his action will certainly not be able to bring him to his goal .
The so @-@ called subjective errors in revolutionary movements indicate this situation .
( The reason why Marxism becomes the scientific knowledge of revolution is that it correctly reflects the actual regularity of the objective world .
It is the truth of the objective world . ) All anti @-@ Marxist thoughts are wrong because they are not based on objective regularity and are cotnpeltely subjective imagination .
Some people said that whatever is generally accepted is objective truth .
( Subjective idealist Bogdanov so said . ) According to this viewpoint , religion and prejudice are also objective truth , because although they are absurdities , they are accepted by the majority of people .
Sometimes correct scientific thoughts cannot compete with these absurdities .
Materialist dialectics is fundamentally opposed to this .
It believes that only the knowledge that correctly reflects objective regularity can be called truth and all truth must be objective .
Truth and absurdity are absolutely opposed to each other .
In order to judge whether a knowledge is truth or not , it is only necessary to see whether it reflects objective regularity .
If it does not agree with objective regularity , then no matter whether it is accepted by everyone , or no matter how it is widely supported or enthusiastically described in a revolutionary movement , it must be treated as erroneous or absurd .
As materialist dialectics accepts objective truth , it accepts absolute truth .
When we say the contents of knowledge reflecting the objective world , we are saying that the object of our knowledge is that perpetual and absolute world .
&quot; Knowledge of truth concerning nature is perpetual and infinite ; it is , therefore , absolute , &quot; ( Engels ) Objective absolute truth does not become our knowledge all at once in its entirety .
We reach absolute truth through the endless process of development of our knowledge through numerous introductions of relative truths .
The aggregate of numerous relative truths is the expression of absolute truth .
The common denominators of human thinking lead us to absolute truth .
Absolute truth is the accumulation of relative truths .
During each stage of scientific development , new seeds are sown into the sum totalthe absolute truth .
The element of truth in each scientific principle is relative .
Absolute truth can only be expressed through innumerable relative .
Absolute truth can only be expressed through innumerable relative truths .
If not expressed through these innumerable relative truths , absolute truth has no way of being known .
Materialist dialectics does not deny the relativity of knowledge .
However , this is only to point out the limitations of objective truth as far as history is concerned .
We are not saying that knowledge itself is only relative .
Scientific knowledge is different from errors .
The former shows and describes the objective absolute truth .
This is the viewpoint of dialectics concerning the relationship between absolute truth and relative truth .
There are two viewpoints .
One is metaphysical materialism and the other is idealist relativism .
Both are wrong on the problem of mutual relationship between absolute truth and relative truth .
Based upon the cardinal metaphysical principle &quot; the material world does not change , &quot; the metaphysical materialists believe that man &apos;s thinking also does not change .
They believe that in the process of human knowledge , the never @-@ changing world is known to man all at once .
That is to say that they deny absolute truth , which they say , is acquired by man in .
one stroke .
They regard truth as motionless , dead , and not developing .
Their mistake does not lie in that they accept absolute truth .
In this respect , they are correct .
Their mistake lies in their failure to understand the historical nature of truth , in their not treating the acquiring of truth as a process of cognizance , and in their failure to understand that absolute truth is released step by step during the process of development of human knowledge .
Each forward step in this process shows some contents of absolute truth .
As far as the entire truth is concerned , each forward step has its relative significance .
Metaphysical materialist opinion on truth is an extreme view in epistemology .
Another extreme concerning the problem of truth in epistemology is idealist relativism .
They deny absolute truth and accept only its relative meaning .
They believe that a scientific discovery does not contain absolute truth , and hence it is objective truth .
Truth is regarded as subjective and relative .
Because of this , all erroneous theories have their right of existence .
Thus imperialist aggression of weak nations and exploitation of the working masses by the ruling class become truths because truth is subjective and relative anyway .
The result of denying objecitve truth and accepting subjective truth
has , of necessity , brought about this kind of conclusion .
The original purpose of idealist relativism is to defend the ruling class .
For instance , the purpose of relativist pragmatism ( or empiricism ) is exactly so .
In view of the above , neither metaphysical materialism nor idealist relativism can correctly resolve the problem of the mutual relationship between absolute truth and relative truth .
Only materialist dialectics can give the correct answer to the problem of the mutual relationship between thinking and existence .
With this answer , the objectivity of scientific knowledge is affirmed , and the meanings of absolute truth and objective truth are correctly understood .
This is the theory of truth of materialist dialectics .

Chapter III Materialist Dialectics
In the last two chapters , the two problems &quot; idealism and materialism &quot; and &quot; dialectic materialism &quot; were discussed .
Dialectics was briefly mentioned .
Now let us discuss this subject systematically .
The Marxist world outlook ( called outlook of the universe ) is dialectic materialism , not metaphysical materialism ( or mechanical materialism ) .
This difference is a serious heaven @-@ turning earth @-@ shaking problem .
What is the world ?
From ancient times to now , there are three answers .
The first is idealism ( be it metaphysical idealism or dialectic idealism ) .
It maintains that the world is created by mind or the God .
The second is mechanical materialism .
It denies that the world is mindTs world , and maintains that the world is a material world , but the material is not developing and not changing .
The third is the Marxist answer which refutes the first two , maintaining that the world is not created by our mind , and not made of undeveloping matter .
Instead , it is a developing material world .
This is dialectic materialism .
The Marxist way of looking at the world is to turn the image in man &apos;s eyes around .
Is it not a great earth @-@ shaking argument ?
The argument that the world is a developing material world has long existed in ancient Greece , but due to limitations at that time , it was only simply and generally stated .
It was called simple materialism .
If there were no such argument , it would be impossible for science to have a foundation .
This argument is basically correct .
Later , Hegel created dialectic idealism , maintaining that the world is developing , but is created by mind .
His theory is idealist development theory .
His theory of development ( dialectics ) is correct , but his idealist development theory is wrong .
In the West , in the 17th , 18th , and 19th centuries , the idealism of the bourgeois class in France and Germany is mechanical idealism .
They were right in saying that the world is a material world , but very wrong in saying that the world is moving like a machine , and that it has only quantitative and positional changes without qualitative changes .
Marx inherited simple materialism and transformed mechanical materialism and dialectic idealism into historically unprecedented and scientifically based dialectic materialism , which has become a weapon for the proletariat of the world and for the revolution of all oppressed people .
Materialist dialectics is a Marxist scientific methodology , a method of cognizance , as well as a world outlook .
The world is basically a developing material world .
This is a world outlook .
Using this world outlook to look at the world , to study the problems of the world , to direct revolution , to work , to produce , to direct warfare , and to argue with other people is a methodology .
In Marxism , world outlook and methodology are one thing .
Dialectics , epistemology , and logic are also one thing .
We wish to talk about dialectics systematically .
It has many categories , many rules , and many principles ( these terms have the same meaning ) .
What are the rules of materialist dialectics ?
Among these rules , which are the basic ones , and which are the subordinate ones but indispensible in materialist dialectics ?
What are the unresolved problems ?
What are the side issues ?
Why these laws are the original rules of the objective world rather than subjectively created ?
Why do we wish to understand and learn these laws ?
This complete theory of materialist dialectics was created by Marx and Engels Lenin developed this theory .
With the triumph of the socialist revolution in Russia and the world revolution , this theory came to a new stage of development , and its contents were further enriched .
The categories contained in this theory are as follows :
The law of unity of contradictions ;
The law of mutual changes between quality and quantity ; and
The law of negation of negation .
The above are the basic laws of materialist dialectics .
All these laws were negated by metaphysical philosophy ( philosophy opposed to the theory of development ) , although the ancient Greeks had simply but unsystematically pointed out the meaning of some of the laws , and later Hegel developed these laws along the idealist line .
It was Marx and Engels who transformed the Hegelian laws into the most basic portions of the Marxist world outlook and methodology .
In addition to the above laws , there are the following related categories : Substance and phenomena ; Form and content ; Cause and effect ; Bases and conditions ;
Possibility and reality ; Accidental and inevitable ; and Chain and link .
Some of these categories have been emphatically studied in metaphysics and idealist dialectics , others have only been partially studied , and still others were new categories proposed by Marxism .
When these categories are in the hands of Marxist revolutionary theoreticians and practitioners , their idealist and metaphysical cloak is ripped off , their one @-@ sidedness is overcome , and their true form is discovered .
As .
time advances , their contents are greatly enriched to become the important elements of scientific methods .
Combining these categories and the aforementioned basic categories , a complete and profound materialistic dialectical system is formed .
All these principles and categories are not created by man &apos;s thoughts , but original principles of the objective world .
All idealists say that matter is created by spirit .
In their eyes , philosophical principles , rules , or categories are of course created by the mind .
Hegel , who developed dialectic system , looked at dialectics in this way .
In his eyes , dialectics is not a rule abstracted from the history of nature and society , but purely rational system of the mind .
After this system is created by man &apos;s mind , it is then applied to nature and society .
Marx and Engels ripped off Hegel &apos;s mythical cloak and got rid of his idealism , putting dialectics in the place of materialism , Engels said : &quot; Dialectical rules are abstracted from natural and human history , and they are nothing but the most general rules of development of natural and human history .
In essence , they may be summarized into the rule of mutual change of quality and quantity , the rule of unity of contradictions , and the rule of negation of negations . &quot; Dialectical rules are rules of the objective world , and at the same time they are also rules of the subjective mind .
Rules in human mind are nothing but reflections of the rules of the objective world through practice .
As we have said before , dialectics , epistemology and logic are one and the same thing .
Why do we learn dialectics ?
We learn dialectics in order to transform this world , and to improve the old relationship between man and man and between man and matter .
In this world , most people are suffering .
They are controlled by a few people and oppressed by various political and economic systems .
People living in China are under inhuman dual oppressionsnational and social .
We must change this old relationship in our strife for national and social liberation .
Is it necessary to learn dialectics in order to rebuild China and rebuld the world ?
Since dialectics is the most general principle of development of nature and society , if we understand it , we shall have acquired a scientific weapon , and we shall be equipped with a theory and method suitable to our practice of transforming the nature and society .
Materialist dialectics itself is a science ( philosophical science ) .
It is the starting point of all sciences , and it is also methodology .
Our revolution is also a kind of
science , called social science or political science .
If we do not understand dialectics , we will not be able to do our work well .
All mistakes in revolution were due to violations of dialectics .
If we understand dialectics , great and powerful effect will be generated .
If we analyze things that have been done correctly , we find that they were done according to dialectics .
Therefore , all revolutionary comradess and first of all the cadres , should carefully study dialectics .
Some people say that there are many people who understand dialectics and are actual materialists .
Although they have never read books on dialectics , they are always right in their work , and they always follow the materialist dialectic method .
In this case , it is unnecessary for them to study dialectics .
Materialist dialectics is a complete and profound science .
Those revolutionaries who are endowed with materialistic and dialectical brains may learn dialectics through practice , but their knowledge is not systematical , not so complete and so profound .
As a result , they are unable to see the bright future of their movement , to analyze the complicated process of development , to grasp the important links in politics , or to deal with all aspects of revolutionary work .
Therefore , they still have to study dialectics .
Some people say that dialectics is profound and hard to understand , and that it is impossible for an ordinary person to learn dialectics .
This kind of talk is also wrong .
Dialectics consists of principles of natural and social thinking .
Anyone who has some social experience ( experience in production and class struggle ) knows some dialectics .
Those who.have more social experience will know dialectics more .
But their knowledge is scattered and confused , and falls within the realm of common sense .
To enhance their common sense about dialectics and put it in order is not difficult .
The reason why people think dialectics is difficult is lack of good books on dialectics .
Many of the books published in China are either poorly written or not well written .
So much so , people are afraid to read those books .
Books interpreting dialectics should use popular language and intimate experience .
I believe that this kind of book will be written eventually in the future .
This lecture of mine is not good either because I myself am a beginner in the study of dialectics , unable to write a good book .
Probably I can in the future .
This is only a wish .
It may become true , depending upon the progress of my study .

Dear Friends ,
We are enclosing a circular announcement of the 8th Route Army Trustee Committee and wish to appeal for your special support for a very urgent cause .
Of course we know that you have carried on numerous activities in supporting the cause of world peace and obtaining aid for China .
This time in addition we appeal to you to divert part of your support for a region where untold suffering and need exist .
This regionNorth and Northwest Chinais becoming more and more the base for large scale partisan and guerilla warfare against Japan , especially in the rear of the enemy .
The 8th Route Army and the partisan @-@ peasant detachments here have been fighting hand in hand in this region for more than a year and are in urgent need of help .
All sorts of help is needed .
Medical and surgical supplies , warm winter clothing , blankets , and funds are required .
The wounded must be taken care of in the rear of the enemy .
Supplies must be sent to them constantly and this takes funds and supplies in large quantities .
Just to transport one wounded soldier from the Shansi front to a base hospital it takes $ 800.00 .
Many operations have to be done without anesthesia .
No pain @-@ killing drugs are to be had .
Bandages , gauze and antiseptics are not to be had in sufficient quantities .
The refugees are constantly coming in an and are mostly women and children .
Their menfolk have joined the partisans and their families must be taken care of .
Funds for their relief are urgently needed .
A million and one needs can be listed so that any help will go a very long way .
We appeal to your organization to help in collecting medical and surgical supplies to care for the wounded and the refugees .
Any contributions and supplies can reach us thru the China Defense League , Hong Kong , China , or thru your national organization if especially marked for the 8th Route Army Trustee Committee .
With greeting , MAO TSE @-@ TUNG , Hon.

INAUGURAL STATEMENT OF THE 8TH ROUTE ARMY MILITARY @-@ POLITICAL JOURNAL 2 January 1939
&#91; Text &#93; As the war of resistance against Japan is proceeding toward a new stage of development , the colleagues of the 8th Route Army are publishing this &quot; Military @-@ Political Journal . &quot; Its significance is obvious : for enhancing the strength of the 8th Route Army in the war against Japan and , at the same time , for providing our friendly forces and people engaged in the war of resistance with the experience of the 8th Route Army .
During the 1 and one @-@ half year war of resistance against Japan , the 8th Route Army , under the leadership of Generalissimo Chiang Kai @-@ shek arid the commanding officers of our war zone , under the leadership of Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief Chu Teh , Deputy Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief Peng Te @-@ huai , officers of various departments at various levels , and in cooperation with friendly armed forces , conducted a heroic war of resistance , executed the correct strategy of fighting &quot; basically a guerrilla war without giving up the opportunity of fighting a mobile war under favorable conditions , &quot; persisted in and developed the guerrilla warfare in North China , established many anti @-@ Japanese bases behind enemy lines , reduced the territory occupied by the enemy , tied down a large number of enemy troops , coordinated the war of resistance waged by the main forces at the front , thwarted the enemy advance toward northwest China , boosted the morale of the people all over the country , broke up the wrong concept of those national defeatists and pessimists : , who said that &quot; it is Impossible to persist in fighting the war of resistance behind the enemy , &quot; and exposed the shameless rumors spread by ChinaTs Trotskyite reactionaries , the pro @-@ Japanese Wang Ching @-@ wei faction , and certain conservative , stubborn elements in the country .
In addition , the rear guard units , as a part of the 8th Route Army , defended the dikes along the Yellow River , and are preparing , in coordination with its friendly forces in Northwest China , to check the enemy advance in Worth China .
All these accomplishments of the 8th Route Army are unanimously recognized and visible to everyone who has eyes to see , except those Trotskyite reactionaries , pro @-@ Japanese Wang Ching @-@ wei faction , and certain conservative stubborn elements .
This is fully demonstrated by the fact that the enemy who not only dares not take the 8th Route Army lightly , but has developed an increasing fear of the 8th Route Army .
The sincerity of the 8th Route Army in its sacrifice and
struggle for the defense of the motherland and its indomitability are plainly laid before the eyes of all the people in the entire country and the entire world .
These facts are undeniable by anybody ^ except the reactionaries , pro @-@ Japanese and certain stubborn elements .
Numerous serialized stories and sketchy reports have been written by Chinese and foreign correspondents , observers and travellers .
It is not accidental that unbiased people are willing to study the experience of the 8th Route Army .
If anybody raises the question as to whether the existence and development of the 8th Route Army , which has Chinese Communist Party members as its backbone , is advantageous or disadvantageous to the Chinese nation , then we can reply in one sentence : those who say &quot; disadvantageous &quot; are in fact unwilling to win the war of resistance , and their allegation is nothing but absurdity which gives direct aid and comfort to the enemy .
From where do these accomplishments of the 8th Route Army come ?
They came from the correctness of their leadership , the heroism of their commanding officers , the support of the people , and the assistance of their friendly forces .
These are the four reasons for the accomplishments of the 8th Route Army .
Among these four reasons , the importance of the assistance of our friendly forces is obvious .
Without the heroic resistance put up by the main forces in the front , there will be no way to conduct guerrilla warfare smoothly behind the enemy line .
Without the coordination of friendly forces located behind the enemy , it is also impossible to score such a great accomplishment .
The officers and men of the 8th Route Army ought to thank their friendly forces which have directly or indirectly coordinated with their war effort .
Especially , they should thank the officers and men of their friendly forces who have given them different kinds of bona @-@ fide assistance and sincere , enthusiastic encouragement .
In front of the common enemy of the nation , the Chinese armed forces forgot their old grudges against each other and became intimate friends helping each other .
This is the basic reason why China as a nation is not going to perish .
People used to say that those who read Ko &apos;s &quot; Chu Shih Piao &quot; without shedding tear are not loyal , and those who read Li Mi &apos;s &quot; Ch &apos;en ChTing Piao &quot; without shedding tears are not pious to their parents .
Today we may say : those who see or hear that the Chinese armed units have forgotten their old mutual hatred and are helping each other and closely united but do not feel touched must be unpatriotic .
Those who are engaged in profiteering and living off friction should do some introspection .
Does the 8th Route Army have any weakness ?
Yes , it does , lots of them .
First of all , it is inferior to the enemy and some friendly armed units in technical equipment .
This is the basic weakness of the 8th Route Array .
It is also the general weakness of the Chinese armed units .
Therefore , how to strengthen our technical equipment in order to defeat the enemy has become a serious task of the 8th Route Army during this new stage of war of resistance .
Second , the 8th Route Army is famous for its ability to conduct guerrilla and mobile warfare , but some cadres still do not have enough understanding about the strategy and tactics for the war against Japan and their application .
Up to now , the cadres in general , especially the newly promoted cadres , still lack a preliminary study about the management and
command of a modern army .
Many cadres with worker or peasant background have not yet elevated their cultural standard to a necessary level .
To resolve these problems is the second task of the 8th Route Army .
Third , consolidation and broadening of the National United Front is the general policy to attain the goal of winning the war and rebuilding the country .
The 8th Route Army has scored great achievements in this respect , but many cadres , especially the new cadres , do not have enough understanding about the United Front .
In some respects , they have performed poorly in working together with friendly political parties and friendly armed units and in adjusting the relationship between different classes of society with a view to turning these relations beneficial to the war effort .
Therefore , strengthening the education about United Front has become an important task .
Fourth , wooing the enemy and puppet troops has long been one of the three main goals of the 8th Route Army &apos;s political work .
Achievements have been made in this respect , but the Japanese language study program among our warriors and cadres and the study of various techniques for conducting propaganda among enemy soldiers and lower level officers for an anti @-@ aggression united front are very inadequate .
We had some success in wooing the Mongolian puppet troops , but further steps should be taken .
Collection and study of information about the enemy and puppet forces are very important , but our achievements in this respect have not yet reached the desired degree .
Fifth , one of the most difficult problems for a protracted war of resistance is the economic and financial problem .
This is a difficult problem for the entire country as well as a difficult problem for the 8th Route Array .
Our awareness of this problem should be elevated to a high degree .
This problem has aroused the attention of certain units of the 8th Route Army , but it has not yet aroused general attention .
In each anti @-@ Japanese base , we should pay attention not only to implementing local financial and economic policies such as those we have carried out in the past , but also to possible participation of armed units in production without hampering their combat function .
In relatively stabilized bases &gt; the combat units take up the responsibility of combat , while government workers in the rear perform the duties of production .
Whenever circumstances permit , combat units may also utilize opportunities to mobilize soldiers and masses to make clothes , shoes , gloves , etc .
In stabilized bases , the non @-@ combat personnel may be utilized to plant vegetables , raise pigs , gather firewood and run cooperatives .
By so doing , they will , on the one hand , improve the livelihood of the troops and supplement their insufficient provisions and , on the other hand , lift the morale of the armed forces and enhance their combat strength .
The aforementioned increase of technical equipment , intensive study of strategy and tactics , correct application of the United Front policy , broadened effort at wooing the enemy and puppet armed personnel , and the participation of armed units in production movements are the important problems to which the 8th Route Army should pay attention during this new stage .
The defects existing in other tasks will be conquered as improvements are made in regard to these important problems .
To further develop what has been achieved and to correct defects are the tasks of all officers and men of the 8th Route Army as well as the tasks of the
Military @-@ Political Journal .
The war of resistance is a long and cruel war .
Further development of the achievements of the 8th Route Army and correction of the defects of the 8th Route Army are urgently needed to enhance the combat strength of the 8th Route Army .
At the same time , it is also necessary to offer our experience to the people and our friendly forces engaged in the war of resistance .
The &quot; 8th Route Army Military @-@ Political Journal &quot; should exert its effort for this purpose .

THE CHINESE ARMY SHOULD EMULATE THE RED ARMY OF THE SOVIET UNION 16 February 1939
&#91; Text &#93; Written at the request of the PRAVDA on the occasion of the 21st founding anniversary of the Soviet Red Army
When we hear of the 21st anniversary of the founding of the Red Army of the Soviet Union , we .
feel a great force standing in front of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people .
This great force extends its friendly hand , willing to back us up in our anti @-@ Japanese national liberation war .
This great force is the Red Army of the Soviet Union .
The Red Army of the Soviet Union has gone through 21 years of training .
Its army , air force , and navy have become an unconquerable force .
Under the brilliant leadership of Comrade Stalin and Marshal Voroshilov , the Red Army , due to its being the army of the workers and peasants , its impregnable technical equipment , profound military training and correct political work , not only became a bulwark for the defense of the socialist Soviet Union a long time ago , but is also a central force for the defense of world peace as well as a model for all the armed forces of the world which are willing to oppose fascist aggression .
In connection with the latter point , I presume that every commanding officer and combat member of the Soviet Red Army and every Soviet citizen knows the nature of the war the Chinese nation and the Chinese people are fighting , under what difficult circumstances is this war being fought , how bright the future of this war iss and what intimate relationship this war has with the Soviet Union and the entire world .
On the China side , not only the 8th Route Army but also all the anti @-@ Japanese soldiers know that the Soviet Red Army is China &apos;s good friend , and that the Soviet Union is helping China in the war of resistance in the most realistic way .
The combat experience and lessons of the Soviet Red Army are especially valuable for the Chinese armed forces and Chinese soldiers to adopt .
Such experiences and lessons enable us to understand that in order to defeat Japanese imperialism , the Chinese armed forces should be correctly oriented politically .
They should also be equipped with modern technical equipment , modern military training , and political work geared to national revolution .
The Chinese armed forces have many strong points .
During the 19 @-@ month war of resistance , these strong points have gradually caused some alarm to the enemy , and won world @-@ wide acclaim .
The Chinese armed forces should groom themselves during the protracted war of resistance against Japan until they become a powerful armed force in the world @-@ wide anti @-@ fascist war for expelling the Japanese from China , liberating China as a nation , and
supporting the anti @-@ fascist war of the world .
Due to historical reasons , the Chinese armed forces still have some defects .
Among the important defects are their inadequate political quality , insufficient modern technology , insufficient modern military training , and especially insufficient political work and lack of a correct orientation .
In all these we should emulate the Soviet Red Army .
Everybody knows that our two great nationsChina and the Soviet Unionhave in the past 10 years established a close relationship built on their resistance to imperialist aggression .
During 1924 @-@ 1927 , the Soviet Union and its Red Army helped China &apos;s Northern Expedition .
Now they have joined hands with us in the struggle against Japanese fascist aggression .
As this war against Japan is confronted with new difficulties , the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union should be further enhanced , and the spiritual link between the Chinese armed forces and the Soviet Red Army should become more intimate .
As both China and the Soviet Union are confronted with an arch @-@ enemy , it is high , time for the two great nations and two great armies to struggle together .
No matter how the fascist nations step up their aggression against China , prepare to attack the Soviet Union , endanger the lives of the Spanish people , or attempt to stir up another devastating war among the major powers of the world , the future can be predicted .
The final victory will never belong to the aggressors .
Instead , the Chinese , Soviet , and Spanish people and all the victims of aggression will win final victory .
On the occasion of the 21st anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Red Army , I , in my capacity as a Chinese and a member of the Chinese armed forces , respectfully extend my anti @-@ fascist friendly felicitations to the Soviet people and the Soviet Red Army .

POLITICAL ORIENTATION FOR NATIONAL GENERAL SPIRITUAL MOBILIZATION 1 May 1939
A Talk at the Yenan National General Spiritual Mobilization and May 1 Labor Day Rally
&#91; Text &#93; Comrades ,
Today , a big rally is being held by all circles in Yenan for implementing the National General Spiritual Mobilization .
At the same time , today is also the May 1 Labor Day .
That we hold such a great commemorative rally has a great significance .
Today is May 1 .
Wherever possible , all proletarians and working people in the world are holding demonstrations .
Comrades , to whom do they demonstrate ?
To the Fascists !
To the aggressors !
Today all the oppressed peoples and nations in the world are holding demonstrations and rallies at various places against fascists and against aggressors !
Today , in China , all of the working class and working people , wherever they can , are holding &quot; May 1 &quot; rallies against Japanese imperialist aggressors .
At the same time , in response to the call of Generalissimo Chiang Kai @-@ shek , all the people , workers , farmers , merchants , students , soldiers , party workers , government workers , and people of all political parties and factions throughout the country begin their National General Spiritual Mobilization .
They pledge to oppose Chinese traitors , support the war of resistance against Japan , concentrate their effort , and concentrate their will .
What for ?
Defeat Japanese imperialism .
( Applause from the audience ) , save China from her crisis , and transform her into a new China ( Applause followed by shouting from the audience : &quot; Down with Japanese Imperialism ! &quot; &quot; Build a New China ! &quot; ... , ) This is the meaning of today &apos;s rally .
This is also the first point I wish to talk about .
Second , why should we have National General Spiritual Mobilization ?
Why does Generalissimo Chiang Kai @-@ shek initiate National General Spiritual Mobilization ?
Our enemy , in order to attain its objective and carry out its plan , wants to annihilate China .
The Japanese fascist militarists are mobilizing all the forces in Japan to continue their fascist war of aggression and to continue this war of bandits for slaughtering the Chinese people .
China &apos;s black sheep Wang Ching @-@ wei , his disciples and grand disciples are giving help to Japanese imperialism , and conducting activities inimical to the war of resistance .
They are engaged in &quot; topple Chiang and oppose Communists &quot; activities .
In Hong Kong and Shanghai , they are organizing what they call an &quot; Anti @-@ Communist National Salvation League &quot; with Wang Ching @-@ wei as their chieftan .
They will also establish a puppet government to surrender to Japanese imperialism .
As the Japanese and the Chinese traitors are so ruthless , we must proceed with the National General Spiritual Mobilization throughout the country , call upon the 450 million Chinese people to be united , boost their morale to fight the war to the end , oppose the Chinese traitors , oppose Wang Ching @-@ wei , oppose the Trotskyites , oppose all the devilish groups and parties , support Generalissimo Chiang Kai @-@ shek , support the National Government , support Kuomintang &apos;s cooperation with the Communist Party , carry the war to the end , mobilize all the forces , and win the final victory .
To what extent shall we fight ?
We shall fight all the way to the Yalu River !
( Applause ) We shall recover all the lost territory !
( Applause ) We shall never stop until our goals are reached .
Therefore , as soon as Generalissimo Chiang Kai @-@ shek launched the National General Spiritual Mobilization , the Chinese Communist Party responds to his call , and supports this movement .
It is for this purpose that all the people from the party , political circles , military circles , civilians , government workers and students of Yenan are holding this rally here today to pledge our support to the National General Spiritual Mobilization .
We must defeat our enemy and build a new China !
( Applause followed by slogan shouting : All people of China unite !
Support Generalissimo Chiang Kai @-@ shek !
Carry out National General Spiritual Mobilization !
Support Long @-@ Term Kuomintang @-@ Communist Party Cooperation !
Support the Kuomintang !
Support the Chinese Communist Party !
Down With Traitor Wang Ching @-@ wei !
Down With the Trotskyites !
Down With Japanese Imperialism !
Long Live Chinese National Liberation ! )
Third , talking about &quot; country &quot; and &quot; nation , &quot; our country is the country of the workers , farmers , soldiers , students , merchants , and all patriotic people .
It is not the country of the Japanese bandits , Chinese traitors , Wang Ching @-@ wei and his cohorts , or the Trotskyites .
Our country should exclude Wang Ching @-@ wei and other traitors .
If those who ignore righteousness and prepare to be traitors and those who spiritually capitulate to the traitors and wish to follow Wang Ching @-@ wei , they should also be excluded .
Our nation has been an independent self @-@ respecting nation for several thousand years , and a ^ nation which cannot tolerate domination by Japanese imperialism .
In our country and nation , we can only permit the existence of an anti @-@ Japanese government , and can never permit any traitor &apos;s government .
We must defend our motherland ; we must thoroughtly liberate the Chinese nation .
The Japanese imperialism is encroaching upon our nation &apos;s independence , and jeopardizing our national existence .
We must defeat it .
We must also defeat all the traitors and thieves who sell out their country and sell out their national interest .
This is the principle of the &quot; supremacy of the country
and supremacy of the nation . &quot; ( Slogan shouting from the audience : Defend the Motherland , Shed Our Last Drop of Blood for the Defense of Our Motherland !
Long Live the Chinese National Liberation !
Down With the Traitors and Thieves Who Sell Out Our Country ! )
Fourth , for the defense of our motherland and for attaining the objective of national liberation , we must win this war of resistance .
The Chinese Communist Party has always advocated : &quot; Resistance against Japan has priority over all ; everything is subordinate to the war of resistance against Japan ; mobilize all the forces to strive for the final victory . &quot; What does this mean ?
It means &quot; military affairs first , victory first . &quot; To win the battle is our only objective .
All that enables us to win a battle , and all that is favorable to the war of resistance should be done and supported .
All that hampers our winning a battle , and all that is harmful to the war of resistance should not be done and opposed .
We oppose all activities of the Wang Ching @-@ wei faction , Trotskyites , trouble makers , stubborn elements and instigators .
We want to knock down all those who sabotage the war of resistance .
( Applause followed by slogan shouting from the audience : Resistance Against Japan Has Top Priority !
Everything Is Subordinate to the War of Resistance Against Japan !
Mobilize All Forces !
Strive for the Final Victory !
Military Affairs First !
Victory First !
Oppose Compromise or Surrender !
Oppose Chinese Traitors and Thieves Who Sell Out the Country ! )
Fifth , in order to attain the purpose of winning the final victory , fighting to the banks of the Yalu River , and recovering the lost territory , we have to unify and consolidate the thinking , will and strength of all the people of the country , and we must carry out , consolidate , and broaden the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front .
This is what Generalissimo Chiang Kai @-@ shek calls &quot; concentration of will and concentration of force . &quot; All people &apos;s will should be focused on one pointthe final victory .
Can people &apos;s will be focused on something else ?
Should we come to a peaceful compromise with Japan ?
Never .
We must strive for the final victory .
We must attain this goal .
All of our strength must be concentrated on the anti @-@ Japanese front .
Should our strength be concentrated somewhere else ?
Never .
Wang Ching @-@ wei wants us to concentrate all our strength behind the traitors &apos; front and the capitulation front .
Can he achieve that ?
Never .
Some trouble @-@ makers and &quot; friction experts &quot; wish to disperse instead of concentrate our strength .
Is it right ?
Entirely wrong .
Therefore , all the will of the people should be concentrated on final victory , and all the strength should be concentrated to one place the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front .
This should never be violated .
Those who violate this principle must be opposed , knocked down and beaten up as traitors .
( SLogan shouting from the audience : Concentrate all the will on Final Victory !
Concentrate All Strength on the Anti @-@ Japanese Front ! )
Sixth , in order to strive for the final victory , and consolidate and enlarge the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front , we must transform the spirit of all the people in the country , and get rid of all the bad and wrong things .
Selfishness , cowardice , corruption , decadence ... are these things good ?
( Audience : &quot; No . &quot; ) All these things should be removed .
This is the reason why we have always promoted the hard working and struggling working style .
Traditionally , our nation has a hard working and struggling working style .
We should make it manifest .
We must drastically change the selfish , coward , corrupt , and decadent style prevailing among many people .
The Communist Party has traditionally advocated for a firm and correct political orientation .
During this war of resistance &gt; we should correct all the erroneous thinking unfavorable to the war of resistance .
First of all , we should correct all the Wang Ching @-@ wei faction , Trotskyite , and traitorous thinking and all the anti @-@ national thinking .
We should also correct all thinking unfavorable to the war of resistance .
For instance , some people say : &quot; Marxism is not a good friend of the Three People &apos;s Principles . &quot; Is this right ?
No , entirely wrong .
Dr.
Sun Yat @-@ sen clearly said : &quot; Marxism is a good friend of the Three People &apos;s Principles . &quot; In violation of Dr.
Sun &apos;s instructions , these people are now saying that these two political ideals are not good friends .
This is a thinking in violation of the united front and a thinking in contradiction to the thinking of more than 90 percent of the working people of the country .
It is an anti @-@ national thinking .
All these erroneous thinking should be corrected and eliminated so that we can have a firm and correct political orientation .
This firm and correct political orientation cannot be divorced from the hard working and struggling working style .
Without a firm and correct political orientation , we cannot induce a hard working and struggling working style .
Without a hard working and struggling working style , we cannot carry out a firm and correct political orientation .
( Applause and slogan shouting from the audience : Oppose Selfishness !
Oppose Cowardice !
Oppose Corruption and Decadence !
Oppose Erroneous Thinking !
Insist on and Affirm a Correct Political Orientation !
Strictly Carry Out a Hard Working and Struggling Working Style ! )
Seventh , finally , let us talk about our general policy now , the general policy for the war of resistance ; that is , the Three People &apos;s Principles .
The Three People &apos;s Principles is the political foundation of the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front .
It must be carried out in full during the course of the war of resistance and national reconstruction .
The Principle of Nationalism is for defeating the Japanese imperialism .
The Principle of People &apos;s Rights is for the freedom of the people .
The Principle of People &apos;s Livelihood is for people to have clothes to wear , rice to eat , and work to do .
All these are very good and necessary .
We must resolutely carry these principles out .
From today on , all the people of the country should really carry out the Three People &apos;s Principles !
They should not talk only ; they should act !
There are many people who say that they believe the Three PeopleTs Principles .
From what I can see , they don &apos;t , because if one believes the Three People &apos;s Principles he will fight the Japanese to the end .
But these people are preparing to surrender .
Wang Ching @-@ wei is one of those who have surrendered .
True believers of the Three People &apos;s Principles do not oppress ordinary people , but they are unwilling to give people their democratic rights .
True believers of the Three People &apos;s Principles take care of people &apos;s clothing , shelter and food problems , but they are unwilling to improve people &apos;s livelihood .
Can these people be called believers of the Three People &apos;s Principles ?
( Audience : &quot; No ! &quot; ) Only those who want to fight to the end , fight to the Yalu River , recover all the lost territory , refuse to surrender , never rebel against their own country can be called real believers of the Principle of
Nationalism , and loyal followers of Dr.
Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s Principle of Nationalism .
Only those who give people their democratic rights , their freedom of speech , press , assembly and association without oppressing the people , and carry out Dr , Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s will for &quot; awakening the masses &quot; can be called true believers of the Principle of People &apos;s Rights and loyal believers of Dr.
Sun Yat @-@ senfs Principle of People &apos;s Rights .
Only those who make an effort to relieve the majority of the people of their suffering , such as to implement Dr.
Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s policy of &quot; land to the tillers , &quot; and carry out production movement so that everybody has clothes to wear , rice to eat , and work to do can be called real believers of the Principle of People &apos;s Livelihood and loyal followers of Dr.
Sun Yat @-@ senrs Principle of People &apos;s Livelihood .
Comrades !
All of us should be faithful believers of the Three People &apos;s Principles and good students of Dr.
Sun Yat @-@ sen .
We should never be pseudo @-@ disciples , or bad students .
We should not give lip service to the Three People &apos;s Principels , and we should really implement all these three principles .
What shall we call those who only talk about the Three People &apos;s Principles and do nothing ?
I would call them pseudo @-@ Three People &apos;s Principles believers .
We call upon all the people in the country to carry out the Three People &apos;s Principles .
Let everybody be real believers of the Three People &apos;s Principles .
I hope all the people in the country would carry out the Principle of Nationalism which calls for defeating Japanese imperialism , and Chinese national salvation ; carry out the Principle of People &apos;s Rights which calls for helping the people , awakening the people , and giving them democratic rights ; and carry out the Principle of People &apos;s Livelihood , which calls for clothes for everybody to wear , rice for everybody to eat and work for everybody to do .
What the country wants to carry out is this kind of the Three People &apos;s Principles , the real Three People &apos;s Principles .
We should struggle to the end for the implementation of the real Three People &apos;s Principles .
( Applause and slogan shouting : Carry Out the Three People &apos;s Principles throughout the Country !
Oppose Those Hypocrites Who Give Lip Service to The Three People &apos;s Principles ! )
These are the reasons we hold our rally today .
It is also for these reasons
that the All @-@ China People &apos;s General Spiritual Mobilization is launched .
In short , we must thoroughly carry out the Three People &apos;s Principles , really
carry out the Three People &apos;s Principles !
Mobilize all our forces to win
the final victory , fight to the banks of the Yalu River , recover our lost
territory !
We must drive Japanese imperialism out of China !
We must establish
a brand new China !

&#91; Text &#93; As the Chinese people &apos;s unwavering war of resistance against Japan is coming to the end of its second year , the British Aid to China Committee holds &quot; China Week &quot; in various places in England to demonstrate its support to our war effort .
On behalf of Comrade Chu Teh , the officers and men of the 8th Route Army , and the wounded soldiers in field hospitals and hospitals in the rear , I wish to say how excited and how encouraged we feel by this kind of sympathy and concern .
We respectfully thank and enthusiastically salute the British people who stand with us together on the international anti @-@ aggression front .
China &apos;s 2 @-@ year war of resistance has shown the power of democratic forces .
These 2 years of war have pointed out that even an industrially backward country which has suffered all kinds of oppression and humiliation in her national life can resist the most barbarous and brutal fascist attack with full confidence of victory .
It also proves that China &apos;s war of resistance cannot be separated from the world @-@ wide anti @-@ fascist force .
In fact , our attack against the aggressors has put our country in the foremost position in the main anti @-@ fascist front of the international struggle for the defense of democracy and civilization in the world .
As soon as the war started , we saw the British people help our war effort with material support , donate medical supplies , send ambulance units to China , and express their sympathy on many occasions .
All these serve to explain that although Great Britain is geographically far away from China , the British people are not indifferent to China &apos;s war of resistance .
However , because of our position in the anti @-@ aggression struggle in the entire world , we have the right to demand more assistance than before .
First , we demand that you strictly watch the attitude of your government , and force your government to take resolute action in ending British shipment of military supplies to Japan .
Several weeks ago , the British embassy and consulate in Chungking were damaged during an indiscriminate Japanese air raid on China &apos;s wartime capital .
To this humiliation the British government
responded with the weakest diplomatic gesturea protest on a piece of paper .
It is this kind of attitude that encourages Japan to wipe out British interest wherever she can .
The most effective way for the British people to restrain the bandits in the Far East and at the same time help China is to put pressure on their government for immediate censure against Japan .
During the last 2 years , Japan &apos;s accomplices , Fascist Germany and Italy , collaborated in destroying world peace , tearing up international treaties , and starting a bloody and cruel war .
Their activities have become a direct threat to the security of Great Britain .
Here is another reason for the British people to compel their government to support China &apos;s war of resistance , and for the British people themselves to take steps complementary to China &apos;s contribution to the anti @-@ aggression front .
To oppose fascism does not call for our engagement in any particular war .
The threat is universal .
Therefore , we must fight it on a world @-@ wide basis .
For example , the Japanese have recently stepped up their anti @-@ British propaganda in their occupied areas .
Therefore , for their own defense , it is necessary for the British people to help China , help that country which is at war with the enemy In the Far East .
In view of the above , may we suggest that you adopt concrete and effective measures to strengthen British policy so as to bring your action consistent with the desire of the British government and British people to frustrate the Japanese aggressors .
For our national independence and freedom and for the peace and freedom of mankind , we have resolutely struggled for 2 years .
During these 2 years , the Japanese militarists utilized those shameless Wang Ching @-@ wei @-@ like defeatists in an attempt to sabotage our Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front and , thereby , to sabotage our war of resistance .
However , our friends can feel reassured .
During the last 2 years , the unity among the Chinese people has matured , and our determination to win the final victory has greatly strengthened .
The Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang are more determined than ever to carry out their joint resolution support Generalissimo Chiang Kai @-@ shek as their leader in the war of resistance .
In the past , the Wang Ching @-@ wei @-@ like defeatists could still hide themselves in unoccupied areas in an attempt to instigate surrender .
Now , they cannot cover up their true intentions any longer .
They have been exposed and chased away .
Geographically , England and China are far apart , but the common desire of the two peoples to defeat Fascist aggressors has brought them together .
Let us join hands to defeat the common enemy of mankind .
Let the peoples of China and Great Britain be united !

NEW INTERNATIONAL SITUATION AND WAR OF RESISTANCE IN CHINA 7 September 1939
&#91; Text &#93; Ever since Fascist Germany started its military action against Poland , Europe has been engulfed in the flames of a serious imperialist war .
According to cable information yesterday , England and France have launched their offensive against Germany .
The British Air Force bombed the German fleet in Wilhelmshaven the day before yesterday , and the French Army began to move toward the German border to launch a surprise attack at a certain point of the German defense line , while other nations are either preparing to enter the war or have temporarily declared neutrality .
All such facts indicate that the scope of the second imperialist war , which started long ago , has further expanded .
The major imperialist nations in Europe , such as Germany , England , and France , have been engulfed in the vortex of war , and other imperialists , such as Italy , are poised for action .
Meanwhile , the socialist Soviet Union remains steady as a rock and adheres to its consistent policy of peace .
All these facts indicate that the essence of the limited imperialist war is being replaced by a general war at flying speed .
The new imperialist war has widened because the imperialist countries have to resort to war to solve their conflicts ; Fascist Germany has to fight its war of aggression at all costs , and England and France , adopting the compromise policy of nonintervention , refuse to conclude a mutual aid pact with the Soviet Union .
Meanwhile , though it was the first to be invaded by Germany , and though its people are now participating in the resistance against Fascist aggression , Poland , at the critical moment of its national destiny , has no independent standpoint of principle and refuses the aid of the socialist Soviet Union , but permits the manipulation of the reactionary bourgeoisie of England and France .
Thus , countries like Poland have become the bone of contention between the two great imperialist groups .
As a result , though the people of Poland are filled with righteous national anger , and the people of England and France are indignant over fascism , from the point of view that &quot; any war is the effort of a certain class to continue its policy &apos; by another means , 1 &quot; and from the point of view of the narrow bourgeois interest
represented by both sides , the nature of the war this time is basically an imperialist war .
The Chinese people have been waging a war of resistance against the Japanese Fascist warlords for 2 years .
China &apos;s resistance war is for the liberation of the nation and for world peace and justice .
Therefore , our standpoint is easily understood .
We sympathize with the revolutionary movement of the laboring people of any nation against fascism and imperialist war , but we oppose the aggressive war of the reactionary bourgeoisie of any nation to sacrifice the interests of the laboring people and redivide the world .
Meanwhile , we are fighting a resistance war , and our diplomatic line is also easily understood .
&quot; To befriend all those who help us and to resist all those who help the enemy constitute an immutable principle , 11 It was thus with us in the past , and it is thus with us now .
However , the Chinese people must understand that , when fighting China &apos;s resistance war , we must not ignore the changes in the world or the European war now in progress .
When judged according to the current situation , the new imperialist war may influence China &apos;s resistance war in the following two ways :
First , the signing of the nonaggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany ended the &quot; anticommunist agreement &quot; and constitutes a blow to Japanese imperialism , isolating it even further .
The outbreak of the war between Germany and Poland has engulfed England and France , and Japan can no longer receive the help from those nations which it did in the past .
Thus , it has been a blow to Japan .
These developments are favorable to China &apos;s resistance war .
Next , the policy of Japanese imperialism to destroy China is consistent and unchangeable .
Past experience shows that Japanese imperialism has the habit of utilizing the tense situation in Europe , especially war in Europe , to destroy China .
During the first imperialist war between 1914 and 1918 , Japanese imperialism proposed the 21 articles to destroy China .
Since the 18 September incident , every time there was trouble in Europe it was an occasion for Japanese imperialism to attack China .
Now , with the outbreak of the European war , the enemy chieftain , Abe , declared that &quot; Japan must concentrate its entire energy to resolve the &apos; China incident , thus indicating that Japan must utilize the situation of the European war and concentrate its entire energy against China .
Thus , the danger of intensified all @-@ out attacks on China by the Japanese Fascist warlords has been created .
Meanwhile , being now tied up in the &quot; European war , England , which has interests in the Far East , may make certain compromises with Japan by sacrificing the interests of the Chinese people in order to salvage its interests in China and the South Seas .
Thus , the grave danger of a possible Far Eastern Munich has been created .
Nevertheless , the most crucial is the issue of China itself .
As long as we can adhere consistently to the national policy of resisting to the
bitter end , of internal unity , especially the policy of Kuomintang @-@ Communist cooperation , and to the policy of striving for national progress , then , under a favorable international situation , we may be able to shorten the duration , reduce the sacrifice , and win victory in our resistance war .
Even under worse conditions , we can similarly and definitely surmount the temporary difficulties and win victory .
Therefore , the Chinese people must pay close attention to the situation of the European war , to the development of each and every stage .
Meanwhile , analyzing the current situation of the resistance war from a firm and correct standpoint , the Chinese people can see clearly that the current domestic political situation makes it impossible for us to handle the new environment successfully .
In other words , the danger of compromise and capitulation still exists , while anticommunism is an indication of the concrete preparation for such compromise and capitulation .
At the same time , the lack of progress and the regression in politics are the obstacles to national unity , the continuous creation of new troops with fighting strength and the growth of new and vigorous strengths of the people .
Therefore , under the new international situation , &quot; the people of the whole country must , under the slogans of supporting Chairman Chiang , supporting the National Government , persevering in the resistance war , opposing capitulation , adhering to unity , resisting differentiation , adhering to progress , and opposing regression , mobilize all strength and prepare for a counteroffensive . &quot;

OUR VIEWS ABOUT THE WORK OT1 THE POLITICAL COUNCIL IN THE PAST AND THE CURRENT SITUATION
8 September 1939
&#91; Text &#93; Organized on the anniversary of the resistance war , the PeopleTs Political Council has been in existence for over a year .
When accepting the invitation to participate in the Political Council , we published &quot; Our Views on the People &apos;s Political Council , &quot; pointing out : &quot; In the violent environment of the resistance war at present , the holding of the People &apos;s Political Council clearly indicates an improvement of China &apos;s political life toward the democratic system and progress of China &apos;s parties and factions , races , classes and strata , and regions toward unity .
Though in its method of creation and the provisions of functions and authorities the People * s Political Council is not a plenipotentiary organ representing the people as can be desired , it does not , for these reasons , lose its effect and significancethe effect of further uniting all strength in the nation to fight the resistance war and save the nation and the significance of initiating the political life of the nation toward true democracy .
Therefore , besides continuing our effort to promote a plenipotentiary people &apos;s representative organ by general election , our Communist Party members must participate in the work of the People &apos;s Political Council with the most positive , enthusiastic , and sincere attitude . &quot;
In the past year the People &apos;s Political Council has convened three times .
When we look at its work so far as a whole , its greatest accomplishment is that it has been able to truly reflect the desire of the greatest majority of the entire nation regarding China &apos;s most urgent and crucial political issues todaypersevering in the national self @-@ defense resistance war , striving for final victory , and attacking the tendency toward compromises and the criminal activities .
At its first general meeting the People &apos;s Political Council solemnly declared : &quot; This Council , on behalf of all the citizens of the nation , solemnly declares : The nation of China must , with an indomitable determination , mobilize all materiel and manpower for self @-@ defense and humanity and wage a long @-@ term
resistance war against the vicious aggressors until the day of final victory . &quot; At the second general meeting it adopted a resolution &quot; to support the government policy to wage a total war , persevere in the war , and strive for the initiative announced by Chairman Chiang &quot; and appealed to the people of the entire nation to &quot; persevere in the resistance war , never to capitulate , and to defend the nation together , in order to complete the tasks of fighting the war and building the nation . &quot; The third general meeting resolved that &quot; the already decided policy of fighting the resistance war must be pursued to the final end &quot; and appealed to the people &quot; to build their confidence , match their steps , and , with one heart and one mind , from beginning to end , recover our territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity and complete the great cause of the resistance war and national construction . &quot; Besides the above , in regard to the various concrete issues of the resistance war and national construction , the members of the Political Council , during the three general meetings , submitted over 300 bills .
Though such bills included both essential and nonessential matters , the members racked their brains , trying to benefit the resistance war and national construction .
What is regrettable is that the government has not definitely and effectively implemented the greater part of the resolutions of the Political Council , thus reducing its efficiency and failing to satisfy the enthusiastic hopes of the people .
In regard to the work of our Communist Party members in the Political Council in the past year , based on the standpoint we declared on 5 July last year , we have followed the directive of the Chinese Communist Central for &quot; a clear political standpoint and sincere spirit of unity &quot; and , under the instructions and encouragement of the progressives in the nation , struggled alongside our colleagues in the Political Council to realize the will and demands of the Chinese people .
Ue firmly believe that the greatest desire , will , and demand of the people today are to strive for the victory of the resistance war and to consolidate and expand national unity and progress , which are indispensable to the victory of the resistance war .
Therefore , in the past three Political Council meetings we proposed time and again &quot; the bill to support the government in introducing the resistance war and national construction program , &quot; &quot; the bill to support Chairman Chiang and the National Government in intensifying national unity and persevering in a sustained resistance war for final victory , &quot; and &quot; the bill to support Chairman Chiang , severely reprimand the household guard for their declaration , and use it as the only criterion in the resistance war policy hereafter . &quot; With the support of all the members , the bills were passed .
In addition , on the various fundamental issues relevant to the resistance war , such as troop building , conscription , developing guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines , introducing democracy , and protecting the rights of the people , we expressed our views in special bills .
In the work of the past year we have firmly adhered to our standpoint : &quot; Participating in the People &apos;s Political Council on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party , we sincerely desire to strive together hand in hand with the Political
Council members of the Kuotnintang , other parties and factions , and those without party or factional affiliations , in order to discuss and decide , in friendship and harmony , the concrete methods and means of enforcement beneficial to the resistance war and national construction . &quot;
Meanwhile , we firmly exposed and ruthlessly attacked all the fallacies advocating surrender and detrimental to the resistance war .
Though expressed in a subtle form , the treacherous theories of renegade Wang and his cohort Li Sheng @-@ wu at the first and second general meetings encountered our attack and rebuttal and those of the majority of the Political Council members .
Though embarrassed for lack of much accomplishment , we believe that , in our work in the Political Council in the past year , we have carefully adhered to the fundamental standpoint of unity and perseverance in the resistance war and followed the people &apos;s will and desire , without the least bit of transgression .
How the government has issued an order to extend the term of the Political Council members for 1 year .
We , as Political Council members , wish to present our views on the current situation and on the policy of how to strive for victory in the resistance war hereafter to our colleagues on the Political Council and the people of the entire nation .
In regard to the characteristics of the current situation of the resistance war , on the one hand , the enemy , after 2 years of aggressive war , finds itself in ever greater difficulties , while our prospect of victory becomes ever more apparent ; on the other hand , the Japanese bandits , instead of changing their policy to destroy China , have become more unscrupulous , cruel , and vicious in following their predetermined policy against China and more cunning in implementing their policy of controlling the Chinese with the Chinese and supporting the war with war .
In military affairs , they have suspended a great frontal offensive and concentrated on wiping out the guerrillas behind their lines in order to lull our determination in the resistance war while consolidating their foundation in the occupied areas .
In politics , they vigorously support and utilize renegade Wang , vociferously advocate their fallacies against Chiang , against the communists , and for surrender , intensify their activities to create a counterfeit party , a counterfeit government , and a counterfeit army , instigate renegade Wang &apos;s followers and other elements with two minds to provoke , alienate , and promote anti @-@ Chiang and anticommunist activities in the resistance war stronghold , and attempt to create a situation which will force China to surrender .
In economics , they resort to plunder , extraction , blockade , and exploitation in order to implement their vicious scheme of supporting the war with war and slaughtering the Chinese people with Chinese resources .
Meanwhile , in the resistance war stronghold , there are some who do not have a correct understanding of the current situation , feeling either that the enemy bandits have eased up on their policy to destroy China , or that the Sino @-@ Japanese issue can be solved by some kind of international conference .
Thus , they abandon their trust in
self @-@ revitalization and fail to perform the practical work to prepare for a counteroffensive .
Some even ignore the danger of national perdition , but concentrate their energy on domestic issues , vigorously encouraging the conspiracies against the communists and against the the unity between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party , constantly attacking all the progressive forces , and ruthlessly oppressing the able young people .
It is the pain of boiling the beans with their own vines , and it is the time when brothers , fighting within their own walls , defend themselves against outsiders together .
Their influence has not only shaken the confidence of all our countrymen in the nation in the victory of the resistance war , but also lowered the sympathy for the nation of China in international public opinion .
Meanwhile , such difficulties as military service and currency devaluation have made some people feel helpless over the resistance war .
All these have made the crisis of the nation more intensified and aggravated .
Simultaneously , the development of the international situation has produced tremendous changes in the resistance war environment of China .
With the evaporation of the anti @-@ communist axis resulting from the signing of the nonaggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany , the Japanese bandits have become more isolated diplomatically and shaken in internal affairs .
This point should be favorable to China &apos;s resistance war situation .
Meanwhile , with the European war resulting from Fascist Germany &apos;s invasion of Poland , the Japanese bandits will utilize the tense situation in Europe to intensify their policy to destroy China , and the compromise faction in England will try even harder to achieve a compromise between England and Japan by sacrificing China .
All these factors will increase our difficulties in the resistance war .
Thus , the environment of China &apos;s resistance war here and abroad is in a new and rapidly changing period .
In this new international and domestic situation , the solemn task of the people of the entire nation at present is to clearly recognize the various characteristics of the new international and domestic situation and their possible tendencies , adhere to the policy of persevering in the resistance war , resist the danger of compromise , strive for a greater national unity , oppose all kinds of conspiracies to create a split , pursue national progress , and oppose all reactionary and regressive phenomena .
Meanwhile , we must seize upon and utilize every change and factor in the international situation favorable to us in order to increase our foreign aid , overcome dangers , break down all difficulties , reinforce our strengths , and prepare for a counteroffensive .
To overcome the current difficulties and dangers and to conscientiously prepare the strengths for a counteroffensive , we feel that we must devote our efforts to the following aspects :
In Politics
Mobilize all the strengths in the nation against compromise and surrender ; expand the anti @-@ Wang movement ; purge the Wang remnants and all the compromise and surrender elements in the resistance war stronghold .
Reinforce the wartime government ; unite military and political leadership ; recruit the talents of all parties and factions ; raise the efficiency of the wartime administrative structure .
Introduce wartime democracy ; severely punish those guilty of illegal oppressive activities against the people and the young ; truly protect the people &apos;s rights to speak , publishs meet and associate , and to arm themselves in the resistance war .
Conscientiously punish and dismiss the corrupt officials ; introduce local self @-@ government .
Form arbitration organs in all areas to handle the disputes between labor and capital and between tenants and landowners ; make suitable improvements in the life of the impoverished workers and peasants in order to increase the resistance war fervor of the masses and facilitate military service and mobilization .
In Military Affairs
Develop guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines : To reach the stage at which the enemy rear is turned into the front and many minor victories accumulate into a major one , the following steps are necessary :
( 1 ) Formulate and introduce administrative programs in guerrilla bases according to the program and principle of the resistance war and national construction and special local conditions .
( 2 ) Unify the military and political powers of the guerrilla bases under the direction of the local main force units with outstanding war achievements and rich experiences .
( 3 ) The Central Government must replenish the resistance war units of the guerrilla bases with the necessary arms and supply the required economic aid .
( 4 ) Send units with the determination and ability to persevere , firm political work , and good discipline behind the enemy lines to expand guerrilla warfare .
( 5 ) All personnel and units sent behind enemy lines must stress unity against the enemy and sincerely implement the policy of the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front ; they must not create internal frictions to damage themselves and help the enemy .
( 6 ) The personnel and units sent behind the enemy lines must follow the policy of democracy and organize a resistance war political power truly elected by the people and approved by the superior @-@ level government .
At the same time , they must enforce the policy to improve the people &apos;s life
in order to rally the broad strata of people against the counterfeit political power , disintegrate the counterfeit army , and prevent our manpower and materiel from falling into enemy hands .
Cultivate a new national defense army : To persevere in the resistance war , especially to prepare for a true counteroffensive when the conditions are favorable and to expel the enemy bandits , a new national defense army must be cultivated as the nucleus in the future counteroffensive .
Therefore , the following steps are necessary :
( 1 ) Select from the front line X X divisions which have a history of combat merits , without distinction as to party or faction or boundary line , as the foundation of army building .
( 2 ) Provide for the unified organization of national defense divisions .
( 3 ) The cadres of the national defense divisions must follow the existing systems of the units selected , receive modern military training and firm political education , and be able to preserve the superior traditions of the particular units .
( 4 ) The equipment , treatment , and supplies of the national defense divisions must be equal , but relatively better than those of the ordinary units .
( 5 ) Specific periods and plans for the training of the national defense divisions must be decided on , and meritorious and able high @-@ level officers must be in charge of the training , which will be carried out in different areas and performed in concentrated groups .
( 6 ) Establish national defense industries , increase purchasing from outside , and plan to complete the modern equipping of X X national defense divisions within 2 years .
In Economics
To destroy enemy construction and exploitation while realizing our production and thrift , the following steps are necessary :
Destroy the economic construction and material exploitation of enemy @-@ occupied areas , activate the people to boycott enemy goods , and prohibit supplying the enemy with useful native products , such as certain special military @-@ need articles .
The indispensable enemy goods must be purchased under state control .
The state must subsidize and encourage private investment in order to expand the industrial @-@ agricultural cooperative movement ; extensively develop all types of practical industries ; vigorously raise agricultural production .
Vigorously promote the thrift movement of military and government organs and private individuals .
In Finance
To firmly change the existing work style and thoroughly enforce the wartime fiscal policy , the following steps are necessary :
The issuance of legal tenders and the circulation of capital must be suitably coordinated in order to avoid currency unbalance between the coast and the interior .
Foreign exchange must be strictly and thoroughly controlled .
The PeopleTs Political Council must form a foreign exchange committee to periodically inspect the Finance Ministry &apos;s approvals and uses of foreign exchange in order to stop all malpractices .
Strictly inspect and prohibit private manipulation of currency and disruption of the legal tender , especially the profiteering , speculation , and manipulation by those in official positions ; severely punish the violators .
Permit the issuance of a limited amount of local paper currency and circulating mediums in war areas , especially in enemy @-@ occupied provinces .
The gold bonds of the state must be sold by wide appeals to overseas Chinese and domestic banking circles ; they must be guaranteed with definite funds and the subscribers given the convenience of domestic investment .
In regard to the tax policy of the state , the progressive rates of business , income , and inheritance taxes must be enforced according to the environment and feasibility of the various areas ; agricultural taxes must be improved and harsh levies abolished .
The assets of traitors must be confiscated .
In the case of landlords who have fled to enemy areas , the state must , on their behalf , collect the money or grain as a minimal amount , to be considered temporarily as the direct receipts of the state .
The state budget , from the central to the local areas , must be formulated anew , increasing the items related to the resistance war according to the need , reducing wherever possible the unrelated items , and deleting all items which can be deleted .
The compensation of state administrative personnel , especially of high @-@ level officials , must be uniformly reduced .
It must be lower than that of military officers at the same levels .
Special expenses and double salary must be eliminated .
Commissions on government loans and purchases must be abolished .
In Diplomacy
To isolate the Japanese bandits and increase foreign aid , the following steps are necessary :
Conscientiously ally with all peoples and governments aiding and sympathetic with our resistance war ; strive to make them increase their material and spiritual aid to us .
Firmly oppose the conspiracy of the government of any country to sacrifice China and compromise with the Japanese bandits ; firmly adhere to the policy of independence and self @-@ determination in diplomacy .
Help the People &apos;s Political Council , the parties and factions , and the mass organizations of all fields to send all types of delegations to the various countries for extensive citizens1 diplomatic activities in order to increase the aid given us by democratic and peace forces .
In Party and Factional Cooperation
Reinforcing the sincere unity among all the resistance war parties and factions , especially the friendly cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party , is actually the fundamental assurance for implementing the above steps , overcoming the dangers of the current situation , and defeating the Japanese bandits and renegade Wang .
Therefore , the following steps are necessary :
Protect the legitimate rights of all resist @-@ Japan parties and factions by unequivocal decrees ; conscientiously abolish all means of restricting and controlling the activities of the so @-@ called heretic parties .
Strictly prohibit discriminatory and oppressive conduct against the Communist Party and other resist @-@ Japan parties and factions ; strictly prohibit damage to the employment and character of the people in the fields of industry , agriculture , military affairs , education , and commerce and of the young people on grounds of party affiliation or ideological issues in order to create a unanimous and sincere unity in the whole nation .
In all types of resistance war work , extensively accept the participation and the talents of all parties and factions ; refrain from rejecting talents useful to the state on grounds of their party or factional affiliations or private opinions ,
At this time , when the bandits are deep in our land , calamity is imminent , and the world is undergoing rapid changes , persevering in the resistance war to the bitter end , consolidating domestic unity , and striving for national progress in order to increase the resistance war strength and
prepare for a counteroffensive against the enemy are the demands and desires of the people of the entire country .
We People &apos;s Political Council members , as the peopleTs representatives and emissaries , respectfully make this joint declaration prior to the fourth general meeting , with the hope that the people of the entire nation and our Political Council colleagues will give us their instructions , encouragement , supervision , and criticisms and that our declaration will serve as the direction of the common struggle of our colleagues inside and outside the Council and of our countrymen throughout the nation .

ESSENTIAL POINTS OF SPEECH ON SECOND IMPERIALIST WAR
At the Yenan Cadres Meeting
14 September 1939
&#91; Text &#93; I.
New Stage of the War
The second imperialist war has long been underway ; it has been foiight for several years .
The Japanese imperialist invasion of China began in 1931 .
Japan first occupied the three Northeastern provinces and thereafter launched a large @-@ scale aggression against China in 1937 .
Italian imperialism invaded Abyssinia in 1935 .
In 1936 Germany and Italy jointly invaded Spain , and in 1938 Germany occupied Austria and Czechoslovakia .
During this period more than 500 million people in the East and the West were engulfed in war , while such imperialist nations as England , America and France did not participate .
Therefore , we call this period the first stage of the second imperialist war .
Beginning from now , from the entry of the British and French imperialist nations into the war , we call it the second stage , because the conditions are entirely different .
If the war in the past could not be termed a world war and was not on a world scale , it is different now .
How it is an imperialist world war and a new stage of that war .
Cause of the War
According to historical facts and Lenin &apos;s theories , in the imperialist era the development of capitalism is extremely unbalanced .
Therefore , a war among the imperialist nations is inevitable .
Less than 20 years after the end of the first imperialist war to redivide the world , the second imperialist war exploded , and the imperialist nations again launched a war to redivide the world .
The initial stage of the new war , the first stage , was built on the world economic crisis .
After the unprecedented world economic crisis of 1929 to 1933 , what followed was not prosperity but a special kind of slump .
Some imperialist nations , either dissatisfied with their share of the spoils in World War I , such as Japan and Italy , or wishing to regain what they had lost , such as
Germany , armed themselves to the teeth and ascended the stage of war , attempting to extricate themselves from the economic crisis by means of war and to avert the collapse of capitalism .
It was thus that the second imperialist war exploded , forming its first stage .
In the second stage of the second imperialist war , Germany , England , France , and Poland launched a large @-@ scale war , and all the capitalist nations in the world will be directly involved .
It is built on the new economic crisis .
The new world economic crisis beginning in 1937 has been permeating England , America , and Prance , the so @-@ called &quot; peaceful &quot; nations , &quot; in the past several years and is developing toward Germany , Japan , and Italy .
On top of the economic crisis , a grave political crisis has arisen , and the people are dissatisfied with capitalism and the bourgeois dictatorship .
Whether in the long @-@ fascistized nations or those in the process of fascistization under the excuse of war , such a political crisis and the people &apos;s dissatisfaction are aggravating .
On the other hand , the socialist Soviet Union is so powerful that no one dares to provoke it .
In this situation , the bourgeoisie of all imperialist nations feel that , besides expanding the war , besides expanding the limited war to a general war , and besides destroying their imperialist friends , they cannot escape from the economic and political crises or avert their own perdition .
All these are the calculations of the bourgeoisie of all nations on the eve of their death .
As for such calculations , the calculations to escape the economic and political crises and avert their own perdition by means of a war to redivide the world , they will inevitably create greater economic and political crises and hasten their perdition .
They have no way to turn .
Like rabid dogs , they have become insane , made completely insane by the capitalist system .
They have no choice but to charge recklessly at their enemies , at the walls of the world .
Such is the life of the bourgeoisie of the nations of the world .
A group of rabid dogs fighting among themselvessuch is today &apos;s imperialist war .
Goal of the War
&quot; War is a continuation of politics . &quot; The nature of imperialism is plunder , The &quot; peacetime &quot; policy of imperialist nations is always plunder .
However , when the policy of plunder of some imperialist nations encounters the interference of other imperialist nations , and when peaceful means cannot be used to overcome such interference , the means of war is resorted to in order to continue the policy of plunder .
Therefore , plunder is the only political goal of an imperialist war .
The goal of the second imperialist war is identical with that of the first one : it is to redivide the world .
In other words , it is to redivide the colonies and semicolonies and the spheres of power , to plunder the people of the world , and to gain control over the people of the world .
The goal of the second imperialist war in its past and present stages is completely identical .
Besides this goal , is there any other goal ?
Is there any good goal ?
None at all .
Whether
Germany , Italy and Japan , or England , America and Prance , all imperialist nations directly participating in the war have only this one counterrevolutionary goal , the goal of plundering the people , and the imperialist goal .
The &quot; permanent peace &quot; of Japanese imperialism , the &quot; national self @-@ determination &quot; of Hitler , the &quot; anti @-@ state socialism &quot; of Chamberlain , and the &quot; aid to Poland &quot; of Daladier are all actually &quot; plunder , &quot; but to make it sound good and deceive the people they ordered their secretaries to create euphemisms .
IV * Essence of the War
The essence of the war is determined by its political goal .
All wars are divided into two categories .
According to Comrade Stalin , wars are divided into ( 1 ) just , nonplundering and liberating wars and ( 2 ) unjust and plundering wars .
Like the first imperialist war , the second war belongs to the second category , because the goal of both wars is to plunder the people of the world , having no other aim and not the least bit of benefit to the people of their own or other nations .
Such are the plundering , unjust , and imperialist essences of the war .
To hoodwink the people and mobilize public opinion , both sides of the war today shamelessly declare themselves just and accuse the other side of being unjust .
Actually , it is a mockery and a deception .
Only national and people &apos;s liberation wars , and wars launched by socialist nations in aid thereof , are just wars .
This time many people are confused .
They feel that , while Germany is unjust , England and France are democracies resisting fascism and Poland is waging a national self @-@ defense war , and that England and France are more or less progressive in nature .
This is an extremely confused view .
Such confusion comes from failing to clarify the goal of the war , and also from failing to clarify the different characteristics of its first and second stages .
Characteristics of the First Stage of the War
The characteristics of the first stage of the second imperialist war are : ( 1 ) In terms of the relations among them , some of the imperialist nations , Germany , Italy , atid Japan , the three imperialists , launched an insane aggressive war , invaded small and weak nations , encroached upon the interests of the democratic countries , and instigated a fascist threat inside them .
Thus , the people of the whole world demanded that aggression be resisted and democracy defended , and they asked other imperialist nations , the so @-@ called democratic nations of England , America , and France , to intervene in the aggressive war and permit the people to salvage the little bit of democracy .
The Soviet Union time and again declared its willingness to form an antiaggression united front with the so @-@ called democratic nations .
Had these so @-@ called democratic nations blocked the aggressors at that time , had they launched a war , together with the Soviet Union , against the aggressors at that time , such as by aiding the Spanish Government , blocking the German and Italian aggression , and helping China stop the Japanese invasion , then such action , such war ,
would have been just and progressive .
Yet the so @-@ called democratic nations did not intervene .
Instead , they adopted the policy of &quot; nonintervention . &quot; Their goal was to let the aggressors and the aggressed consume themselves in war before they would intervene and reap the benefit .
As for England and France , which presented Austria and Czechoslovakia to Germany , it was a condition of exchange .
In other words , it was in exchange for Germany &apos;s attack oti the Soviet Union .
England and France hoped for a conflict between the Soviet Union and Germany .
Borrowing a knife to commit murder , when both sides were wasted , they could proclaim hegemony over the world .
As a result of this policy of &quot; nonintervention &quot; in the war , only some of the imperialist nations came forth to do battle , while others &quot; sat atop the mountain to watch the tigers fight , &quot; thus demonstrating the onesided , limited , and nonintervening essences of the war .
The people were unable to force the bourgeois governments of the democratic nations to abolish the counterrevolutionary &quot; nonintervention &quot; policy they followed .
Hence the onesidedness .
It was the first characteristic of the war in its first stage .
( 2 ) However , during this period , besides the unjust and plundering war launched by German , Italian , and Japanese imperialism and the tolerance of this war on the part of the so @-@ called democratic nations , there was another factor .
There was also the national liberation war , i.e. , Abyssinia &apos;s war to resist Italy , the Spanish Republic &apos;s war to resist Germany and Italy , and China &apos;s great resistance war against Japan , and the people of the whole world and the socialist Soviet Union all sincerely rendered aid to such wars .
The wars of the second category were just , nonplunderiug and liberating wars .
It was the second characteristic of the war in its first stage .
The onesidedness of the imperialist war and the existence of anti @-@ imperialist wars were the two characteristics of the imperialist war in its first stage .
Our Revolutionary Policy in the First Stage of the War
According to the characteristics of the war in its first stage , the revolutionary policy during this stage , without doubt , was to organize an antiaggression united front of the aggressed nations in order to resist the onslaught of the aggressors , to organize the rising antifascist struggles of the people inside the democratic nations in order to protect democracy , and , at the same time , to continue organizing the struggles of the Soviet Union and the governments of the democratic nations to block the further development of aggression .
The third point , organizing the antiaggression united front of the Soviet Union and the governments of the democratic nations , began after Munich and resulted from the failure of Spain and the destruction of Czechoslovakia .
The anger of the broad strata of people in England and France , and even of the leftwing elements in the bourgeoisie , created the possibility of forcing the Chamberlain and Daladier governments to abandon the policy
of nonintervention and form an antiaggression united front with the Soviet Union .
This possibility was not entirely lost at that time .
In sum , the general task of the revolution during this period was to organize all possible forces into an antifascist and antiaggression united front in order to resist the insane aggression of the three fascist nations and smash the fascist raids inside the various nations .
Therefore , at that time the united front had the following four possible components : ( 1 ) the people &apos;s and the proletarian and petty bourgeois united fronts in the capitalist countries ; ( 2 ) the national and the proletarian and bourgeois united fronts in colonial and semicolonial countries ; ( 3 ) the socialist Soviet Union ; ( 4 ) the bourgeoisie and the governments of the democratic countries .
These four components were possible at that time because , under the insane aggression of the fascist countries , under the threat of the domestic fascist power in the democratic nations , and under the existing anti @-@ Soviet danger , there were common interests , to a certain extent , between the bourgeoisie and the governments of the various democratic nations on the one hand and the people of their particular nations on the other , between the bourgeoisie and the governments of democratic nations on the one hand and the people of the colonies and semicolonies , and between the bourgeoisie and the governments of the democratic nations and the Soviet Union .
Among the components , the main force was the Soviet Union .
If the Soviet Union and the governments of the so @-@ called democratic nations had organized a truly effective united front to coordinate with the united fronts of the people of the various nations and the colonies and semicolonies , they could have blocked the further aggression of the fascist countries and postponed the outbreak of a world war .
Even if a war should break out , they could have defeated the fascists .
Had it been done , it would have benefited the people and the nations of the world other than the aggressors , and it would have been supported by the international proletariat .
Therefore , the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations , concluded mutual aid treaties with France and Czechoslovakia , and finally conducted negotiations with England and France .
Such a revolutionary policy was compatible with the international situation at that time and was necessary and correct .
It was the only way , there being no other choice .
Breakdown of British @-@ French @-@ Soviet Negotiations and the Beginning of the Second Stage of the Wax
The bourgeoisie of the so @-@ called democratic nations on the one hand feared the fascist nations because they were invading their interests3 but even more they feared the development of the revolutionary strength .
They feared the Soviet Union , the liberation movement of the people of their own countries , and the national liberation movement of the colonies and semicolonies .
Therefore , they refused to form a true antiaggression united front or wage a true antiaggression war with Soviet participation , but instead organized their own counterrevolutionary united front and fought their own plundering bandit war .
The British @-@ French @-@ Soviet negotiations lasted more than 4 months , from 15 April to 23 August .
While the Soviet Union exhausted all its patience , England and France refused to subscribe to the principle of equality and reciprocity , only asking the Soviet Union to guarantee their security .
Yet they would not guarantee the security of the Soviet Union or the Baltic nations , thus leaving a gap for Germany , nor would they permit Soviet troops to pass through Poland to resist the aggressors .
Naturally , the Soviet Union was unwilling to agree to such a treaty proposed by England and France , a treaty which was completely incompatible with the revolutionary goal and compatible only with the counterrevolutionary goal .
Meanwhile , England and France absolutely rejected the treaty proposed by the Soviet Union , which was based on the principle of equality and reciprocity , truly beneficial to blocking the development of the aggressors , and truly beneficial to world peace .
This was the basic cause for the breakdown of the negotiations .
During this period Germany abandoned its anti @-@ Soviet stand and wished to discard the so @-@ called &quot; anticommunist agreement &quot; and recognize the inviolability of the Soviet border .
Thus , the mutual nonaggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany was concluded .
The lack of any sincerity on the part of England and France in their negotiations with the Soviet Union , their lack of sincerity in halting aggression , and their decision to break up the negotiations proved nothing else than that Chamberlain had already decided on war .
Therefore , the outbreak of the war was not intended by Hitler , but by Chamberlain , because , if he really wanted to avoid war , the participation of the Soviet Union was indispensable .
Even England &apos;s Lloyd George , a bourgeois representative , would understand this point .
Yet some idiots cannot understand it even today , feeling that Chamberlain had not made any advance preparations for the war .
They fail to see that Chamberlain &apos;s participation in the three @-@ nation negotiations was only for the purpose of mobilizing public opinion , so that he could tell the people : The British and French governments have done their best and , since we cannot succeed in the three @-@ nation alliance , we have no choice but to open fire on Germany .
In this situation , the war between Germany and England , France , and Poland exploded in early September .
Thus began a new stage of the second imperialist warits second stage .
Characteristics of the Second Stage of the War
At present , after the outbreak of the world war , the condition has basically changed .
The distinction between the fascist and democratic nations in the past has lost its meaning .
Today , the distinction can only be : ( 1 ) the nations waging an unjust and plundering imperialist war and those actually supporting such a warthe first category ; ( 2 ) the nations waging just and nonplundering national liberation and people &apos;s liberation wars and those supporting such Warsthe second
category .
Wow we must make new distinctions based on the new conditions and discard the old ones , because the conditions have changed .
The bourgeoisie of the democratic nations have made their final rejection of compromise with the people .
They have rejected compromise with the Soviet Union and launched a plundering war .
Now the most reactionary nation in the world is England , and the ringleader against the Soviet Union , communism , democracy , the people , and small nations is Chamberlain .
In this situation , all communist party members must understand that the time for striving to rally the bourgeoisie and the governments of the so @-@ called democratic nations and for building a united front together with the Soviet Union , the people of all nations , and the colonies and semicolonies has passed , and there is no longer such a possibility .
The only possibility today is for the Soviet Union to build an antiwar and antiaggression united front together with the people of the capitalist countries and the oppressed colonies and semicolonies .
We no longer can count on the bourgeoisie of the so @-@ called democratic nations .
This component . , as a result of its vacillation , has finally shifted to the enemy stronghold and become one of the two strongholds in the imperialist war .
It is a momentous change .
Therefore , the possible components of the new united front have been reduced from four to three , with the following results : First , the second imperialist war has shifted from limited to general ( from limited reaction to general reaction ) ; next , the components of the new antiwar and antiaggression united front have changed from complex to simple .
These are the two characteristics of the war in its second stage .
Many comrades fail to pay attention to the changes in condition or the characteristics of the changes .
They think that everything is the same as before , and their thinking is suspended in the past , looking at the new changes with the old viewpoint and ignoring the essential changes in the new situation ; therefore , they unconsciously fall into the trap of complete error , into the situation of the social democratic party .
I hope that the comrades committing this error will promptly correct themselves , and I believe that , once reminded , they will correct themselves promptly .
IX .
Our Revolutionary Policy in the Second Stage of the War
In view of the characteristics of the war in its second stage , what should be the revolutionary policy of the proletariat , especially of the Communist Party ?
I feel that it should be as follows :
( 1 ) We must appeal to the people in the belligerent nations to rise and resist the imperialist war , expose its imperialist essence , regard all the belligerents as bandits , be they of one side or the other , especially British imperialism , the ringleader , warn the people against being tricked
by the imperialist bandits , propagandize to them to turn the imperialist war into a revolutionary domestic war , and build a people &apos;s united front against the imperialist war .
In all belligerent nations , wherever there are communist parliamentary members , they must vote against the war budget in the manner of the courageous and firm struggle waged by Germany &apos;s proletarian leader , Comrade Liebknecht , in the German parliament during the first imperialist war .
They must never vote for the war ; they must never merge their own identity with that of the social democratic parties , because the social democratic parties of these nations are repeating the errors of the first imperialist war and , under the so @-@ called slogan of &quot; defending the mother country &quot; ( the mother country of the capitalist bandit group ) , are shamelessly supporting the war .
Japan &apos;s social democratic party , the so @-@ called Social Mass Party , has long since deserted the proletariat in order to support the aggressive war of its warlords .
Under the intimidation and bribery of Chamberlain and Daladier , the social democratic parties of England and France have betrayed the British and French proletariat in order to support the bandit war of British and French imperialism .
The Polish social democratic party supports the running dog bought by Chamberlain , the bourgeois reactionary government of Poland , betraying the interests of the nation .
In Poland , doubtlessly , they should mobilize the entire people , ally with Russia , resist the German imperialist aggression , and fight to defend and liberate Poland .
Yet the fascist government of Poland has suppressed its national liberation movement and refused the aid of the Soviet Union ; it is willing to lead the people to serve as the cannon fodder of British and French financial capital and to turn Poland into a component of the reactionary front of international financial capital .
Without doubt , we sympathize with the Polish people , but we definitely do not sympathize with the reactionary government of Poland .
That the Polish social democratic party supports such a government is similarly intolerable .
Therefore , whether in Germany , Japan , or Italy , or in England , France , or Poland , only by exposing the treachery of the social democratic party will the communist party of all belligerent nations be able to rally the masses , organize a revolutionary united front , and prepare to smash the counterrevolutionary war with a revolutionary war .
( 2 ) In the neutral countries , such as America , the communist party members must expose before the people the imperialist policy of the bourgeois government , i.e. , the policy of neutrality in name but supporting the war in fact , and attempting to make a big profit from the war .
During the 2 years of the Sino @-@ Japanese war , U.S.
imperialism , under the mask of neutrality , has reaped a big profit , and now it wants to make another big profit out of the new war .
Two weeks ago , in my talk on 1 September , I thought that the American bourgeoisie for the moment would not abandon the democratic and peacetime economy .
Who would expect that , within a few short days , it would declare the so @-@ called &quot; partial emergency situation . &quot; Thus , it is following the steps of England and France and
21 .
advancing toward reaction and war .
The communist party members must oppose such a false neutrality , which actually aids the imperialist war , the fascism of the governments of such nations , the treachery of their social democratic parties , and their involvement in the war , so .that the area of the war will not expand without limit .
( 3 ) In the colonies and semicolonies , it is the national united front , either to resist the aggressors ( such as in China ) or to resist the suzerain nations ( such as in India ) , in order to attain the goal of national independence .
We must oppose the activities of the national renegades to betray the national interest in such nations before we can develop the united front to defeat the enemies .
In the colonies of the belligerent nations , we must oppose the treacherous activities of the national renegades in support of the war waged by their suzerains and resist recruiting the people of the colonies into the front of the suzerain nations .
We must tell the colonial people of the painful experience of the first imperialist war .
In the colonies and semi @-@ colonies , if we do not oppose the national renegades , the national liberation movement will have no hope .
The Future of the War
This war is a sustained war .
I agree with Comrade Voroshilov &apos;s speech at the 18th congress of the Soviet Communist Party .
He said : &quot; Modern wars in the future will be sustained , prolonged and consuming . &quot; He also said : &quot; Without doubt , in an inevitable and general military conflict , there will be an unprecedented life and death juncture . &quot; His estimates are correct .
The quality of being sustained is found in imperialist and anti @-@ imperialist wars , counterrevolutionary and revolutionary wars , their continuation and partial and temporary suspension , the reorganization of and changes in the participants , and the destruction and creation of participants .
Such intertwining , tortuous , and complex changing conditions form the sustained essence of war .
The second imperialist world war is an unprecedented calamity for mankind .
Death , illness , starvation , unemployment , loss of education , loss of family members , and the breaking up of homesall kinds of tragedies will fill the whole world .
Without doubt , such , conditions will cause the oppressed people of the capitalist nations and the oppressed people of colonies and semi @-@ colonies to wake up , unite , resist the imperialist war and organize revolutionary wars .
The scale will be much larger than that of World War I.
During the first war , besides Russia , there was no communist party in any nation .
Now it is different .
The communist party is distributed in several dozen nations , and it has become strong in politics and organization .
During World War I there was no socialist nation .
Now it is different .
The Soviet Union not only exists but has become a first @-@ class power .
It is firmly against the imperialist war and for the people &apos;s liberation and national liberation wars .
It will have a great effect in defending the interests of mankind and in blocking imperialism .
.
,22 .
Now the world has been clearly divided .
All the bourgeoisie participating in the imperialist war are reactionaries , forming a reactionary stronghold .
The current imperialist war is a war between the two factions of the imperialist group in this great reactionary stronghold .
This factional conflict in the great reactionary stronghold will not stop them from joining together to resist the Soviet Union , the people &apos;s liberation movement of all nations , the national liberation movement of the colonies and semicolonies , and the world revolution .
It would be infantile to think that they will fight forever or that they will be easily overthrown by the revolutionary people .
This is one aspectthe aspect of the world reactionary front .
In the other aspect we have the Soviet Union , the people &apos;s liberation movement of the capitalist nations , and the national liberation movement of the colonies and semicolonies .
All these form the revolutionary front and the revolutionary stronghold .
The goal is to smash the world reactionary stronghold , defeat the imperialist war with the revolutionary war , overthrow the ringleaders of war , knock down the bourgeoisie , and liberate the oppressed people and oppressed nations in the world from capitalism , from the imperialist war .
This is a great struggle process , an arduous and sustained process , and a process of educating the people , wakening them , organizing them , and leading them to fight the bourgeoisie .
The capitalist economy has reached a dead end , and the era of great revolutions with momentous changes has arrived .
The current era is the new era of war and revolution and the era to completely reform the dark world into a world of light , and we are in the midst of it .
The nation of China , which has waged 2 years of resistance war , is a component of the world revolutionary stronghold , an important and effective component .
The national liberation war of the 450 million people will produce a great effect in the reform process of the world .
The imperialist war is detrimental to the world and to China .
Nevertheless , the existence and development of the Soviet Union , the people &apos;s liberation movement of the capitalist nations in the world , and the national liberation movement of the colonies and semicolonies are all beneficial to China and constitute the reliable aid to China &apos;s revolutionary war .
China , the Soviet Union , and the people &apos;s liberation and national liberation movements of all nations must organize a firm united front .
It will be a revolutionary united front , a united front against the counterrevolution .
On this point , the war between the imperialists and their mutual wasting furnish a favorable condition to the people &apos;s liberation &apos; and national liberation movements , China &apos;s resistance war , and the Soviet Union &apos;s construction of a communist society .
In this respect , the darkness of the world is temporary , and its future is bright .
Imperialism will perish ; the liberation of the oppressed people and nations is without doubt .
China &apos;s future is also bright .
As long as its Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front becomes more consolidated and we , under the slogans of persevering in the resistance war , opposing surrender , adhering to unity , opposing splits , adhering to progress , and opposing regression , struggle vigorously , our enemy will perish , and a free and independent new China will soon emerge .

INSCRIPTION IN COMMEMORATION OF THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE AN @-@ WU YOUTH TRAINING CLASS
5 October 1939
&#91; Text &#93; The young people with their fresh blood and youthful vigor who have joined the revolutionary ranks , be they Communist Party members or nonmembers , are all valuable .
Without them , the revolutionary ranks cannot develop , and the revolution cannot succeed .
Nevertheless , the natural shortcoming of the young comrades is their lack of experience , while revolutionary experience must begin with participating personally in the revolutionary struggle and performing the work of the lowest level .
After a number of years of concrete work , without the least bit of falsity , experience will belong to those who are inexperienced !
To the commemoration of the second anniversary of the youth training class .

SPEECH AT RALLY OF SCHOOLS AND YOUTH BODIES IN YENAN IN COMMEMORATION OF THE FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE &apos; 9 DECEMBER &apos; MOVEMENT
9 December 1939
&#91; Text &#93; At a rally of school and youth bodies held in Yenan on 9 December 1939 in commemoration of the fourth anniversary of the 9 December student movement , Chairman Mao pointed out the great historical significance of this movement .
The 9 December Movement has great historical significance .
It was a movement which prepared this country for the great war of resistance against Japan .
It was like the 4 May Movement , which prepared this country for the first revolution .
The 9 December Movement motivated and prepared the way for the &quot; 7 July &quot; war of resistance .
After the 4 May Movement came the 30 May Movement , during which China saw the formation of an all @-@ people &apos;s movement , and all the workers , students and merchants were on strike everywhere in the country .
The 4 May Movement prepared public opinion , prepared the cadres , prepared the ideology , and prepared people &apos;s minds for the great revolution of 1925 @-@ 1927 .
The 9 December Movement was a movement that mobilized the Chinese people for the war of resistance , a movement that reoriented our ideology and trained our cadres and a movement that mobilized the entire nation .
This movement occurred when the Red Army reached northwest China on its northward move to fight the Japanese .
This is how the 9 December student movement was related to the northward move of the Red Army in the war against Japan .
These two events helped start the all @-@ people * s war of resistance .
After the &quot; 1 August &quot; declaration , the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee called upon the people all over the country to oppose Japanese imperialism , and it asked the entire nation to be united for the war of resistance .
The 9 December Movement took place after the &quot; 1 August &quot; declaration .
The students opposed suppression of the youth at that time .
They opposed the Japanese imperialist aggression against China .
They demanded that the civil war be ended and that all political
parties unite to fight Japan .
The occurrence of this movement shocked the entire country .
The 9 December Movement will be a great event to be remembered in history .

COMRADE MAO TSE @-@ TUNG REFUTES THE RUMOR FABRICATED BY THE COMMANDING HEADQUARTERS OF A CERTAIN WAR ZONE
January 1940
&#91; Text &#93; Recently , the headquarters of a certain war zone issued a circular telegram which stated : &quot; According to reports , Mao Tse @-@ tung returned from Sinkiang to Yenan and made a report to his subordinates on 5 May , He said that Li Li @-@ san &#91; 2621 4539 0005 &#93; , who led 730 men , including some Russians and many Soviet @-@ made airplanes , would use the opportunity of counterattacking the enemy to seize political power from the central government and would make Lanchow China &apos;s Moscow . &quot; A reporter of this newspaper asked Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung about this report .
The following is Comrade Mao &apos;s reply .
This kind of report must have been fabricated by the Japanese .
It is rather strange that it came from China &apos;s war zone headquarters , I &quot; returned from Sinkiang to Yenan , 11 but I have not even prepared to go to Sinkiang .
As to Li Li @-@ san , he has been arrested by the Soviet authorities because of his participation in the activities of the Trotskiyite reactionary bloc , I don &apos;t know how he came back !
Those who instigate a split between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party and those who are prepared to surrender to the Japanese aggressors have fabricated hundreds of thousands of intelligence reports .
This piece is the most clumsy .
If it were believed by any person , then that person must be very stupid .
&quot; To seize political power from the central government.11 What a big headline !
The plain fact is that the border region is being seized &#91; by the Nationalists &#93; .
In July this year they seized Hsun @-@ i of the border region .
Recently they seized Chen @-@ yyan and Ning @-@ hsien .
Bombers and heavy artillery pieces were used in the attack .
We heard that they will take Ching @-@ yang , Ho @-@ shui , Shun @-@ yao and Lu @-@ hsien to pave the way for seizing Yenan .
In front of us are the Japanese , who grab large chunks of territory from China .
Behind us are the Chinese who seize small pieces of land from our Shensi @-@ Ransu @-@ Ninghsia border
region .
The border region had 23 counties , hut now there are only 20 counties left .
Even if they take all the counties left in the border region , the total area is less than one @-@ thousandth of what the Japanese snatched from us .
How brave these gentlemen are !
Your newspaper should publish articles advising those brave gentlemen to restrain themselves a little .
If they are truly brave , let them deal with the Japanese .
According to past experience , no good results will come from civil strife .

CABLE MESSAGE FROM POLITICAL COUNCIL MEMBERS MAO TSE @-@ TUNG AND OTHERS TO THE POLITICAL COUNCIL
3 February 1940
&#91; Text &#93; Gentlemen of the Secretariat of the Chungking People &apos;s Political Council :
Recently it has been reported repeatedly that the secret service organizations in Shensi , Kansu , Shansi , Hopeh and Honan provinces had issued instructions to their subordinates saying , in brief , that a North China inspection group of the People &apos;s Political Council would arrive soon .
Its mission , according to these reports , is to collect information in order to prove that the Shensi @-@ Kansu @-@ Ninghsia border region occupied by the Communist 8th Route Army is responsible for the frictions that occurred among these provinces .
The inspection group is to bring back information to Chungking and make proposals to the government authorities as to how to deal with these problems .
It was further learned that a resolution will be introduced during the next session of the People &apos;s Political Council to eliminate the special status of the border region and the 8th Route Army and to use this opportunity to attack the Chinese Communist Party .
All secret service agents were instructed to collect information and to make preparations to welcome the inspection group in coordination with local party , government and military organizations , My colleagues and I could not believe this report , because it is rather queer .
Now that I have received a telegram from you , I have begun to believe that an inspection group really has been organized .
A review of the names of the leader and members of this inspection group shows not only that not a single communist member of the People &apos;s Political Council was invited , but also that Messrs Shen Chun @-@ ju &#91; 3088 0689 0320 &#93; , Tsou Tao @-@ fen &#91; 6760 7290 1164 &#93; , and Tao Hsing @-@ chih &#91; 7118 5887 4249 &#93; , who introduced the original resolution at the fourth session of the People &apos;s Political Council for organizing such an inspection group , and Messrs Chang I @-@ lin &#91; 1728 0001 7792 &#93; , Huang Jen @-@ chih &#91; 7806 0117 0037 &#93; , Chiang Heng @-@ yuan &#91; 3068 1854 3293 &#93; , and Chang Piao @-@ fang &#91; 1728 5903 5364 &#93; , who are known for their moderate attitudes , indisputable reputation , impartiality and selflessness , are not among the members .
The group consists
essentially of Kuomintang members of the People &apos;s Political Council with the exception of Yu Chia @-@ chu &#91; 0151 1367 5468 &#93; of the National Youth Party and Liang Shih @-@ chiu &#91; 2733 1395 4428 &#93; of the National Socialist Party , who during the second session of the People &apos;s Political Council made known his absurd pro @-@ Wang Ching @-@ wei arguments , advocated peace with Japan , and subsequently clashed violently with communist and other members of the People &apos;s Political Council who resolutely advocated war with Japan .
With the inspection group so organized , the information gathered and the conclusions drawn therefrom will undoubtedly be biased and harmful to public interest .
That this inspection group should collaborate with secret service agents is only natural .
It may be recalled that in December 1938 Chang Chun @-@ li &#91; 1728 0689 0536 &#93; wrote an article advocating the elimination of the special status of the border region and the 8th Route Army and the elimination of communism .
Shortly afterwarda Wang Ching @-@ wei issued a message propounding his anticommunist views .
If the purpose of this inspection group is not any different from that of Wang Ching @-@ wei and Chang Chun @-@ li , then it might be easier for the gentlemen of the inspection group to stay in Chungking , write a few impressive articles echoing the ideas of Wang and Chang , and then draft a resolution for the People &apos;s Political Council .
Why should they brave the severe winter weather to make this trip ?
If they think that they are unable to convince the public without an on @-@ the @-@ spot inspection , then it is ridiculous for these people with special relations to gather fabricated information from the hands of secret service organizations and then write a 200,000 to 300,000 @-@ word inspection report filled with vehement denunciations of the Communist Party as a legal document for opposing communism , limiting communism and dissolving communism .
Internal political problems can only be resolved according to rational political principles .
How can deliberate pretentions resolve any problem ?
Some people may say that we communists are wrong in our estimate of the inspection group , that the forthcoming inspection will be made justly and fairly without any fishy motive , and that its mission is to maintain two @-@ party cooperation and to seek a rational settlement of the border region problem on the basis of national unity .
If so , it is then fortunate for the country that what we said is wrong .
If so , when the inspection group arrives at Yenan the undersigned are prepared to entertain our colleagues of the People &apos;s Political Council with millet rice and kaoliang liquor , the two special products of northern Shensi .
We will then toast our guests while discussing freely our grand plans for national unity and national salvation .
You can rest assured that we will not be disrespectful in entertaining our honorable guests .

DECLARATION OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR THE PROMOTION OP CONSTITUTIONAL
GOVERNMENT IN YENAN
20 February 1940
&#91; Text &#93; To : The National Governments the People &apos;s Political Council , the Kuomintang , All Anti @-@ Japanese Armed Unitss All Anti @-@ Japanese Mass Organizations and the Press .
The inaugural meeting of the Association for the Promotion of Constitutional Government in Yenan was held on 20 February 1940 .
We respectfully declare our association &apos;s views about constitutional government and hope that our views will be adopted and carried out by the government .
We also hope that people of all circles will join us in promoting constitutional government so that true democracy can be carried out .
The future of the war of resistance depends upon this .
First , the meaning of carrying out constitutional government is to let the people &apos;s will manifest itself and to win the war against Japanese imperialism .
It has been 29 years since the founding of the republic .
But our country is a republic in name only , a dictatorship in fact .
Not to mention such dictators as Yuan , Feng , Tuan and Tsao , the Kuomintang , since it came to power , has followed in the footsteps of these dictators without any improvement .
The reason is that much lip service has been paid to political tutorage without fostering the people &apos;s will to fight imperialism .
In 1924 a declaration of the first National Congress of the Kuomintang said : &quot; In recent years the so @-@ called system of people &apos;s rights in various countries has usually been monopolized by the bourgeois class and has become a tool for oppressing the ordinary people .
The Kuomintang1s Principle of People &apos;s Rights is shared by all ordinary citizens , not privately owned by a few people . &quot; These words cannot be better stated !
If this declaration were put into effect , there would have been no civil wars or foreign aggression .
Unfortunately , these fine words were shelved , and one @-@ party dictatorship is euphemized as political tutorage .
Throughout the country , from north to south and from big cities to deserted villages , we have not seen any person or anything well tutored .
As a result of many years of political tutorage , we can only see
corrupt officials willfully doing whatever they wish and local rascals and oppressive gentry committing an unlimited number of crimes .
The nation &apos;s law is scoffed , the wealth of the nation is squandered , and , as a consequence , this brought foreign invasion .
Since the beginning of the war of resistance , the entire nation has arisen to fight for its survival .
The greatest problem now is how to let the people &apos;s will manifest itself and how to thoroughly defeat Japanese imperialism .
Alas , some people still wish to isolate the implementation of constitutional government from such critical national issues as letting the people &apos;s will manifest itself and chasing the Japanese aggressors out of China .
They refuse to see in constitutional government a tool for saving the country from perishing .
Instead , they regard it as a skillful design to confuse people &apos;s eyes and ears .
As a consequence , the people &apos;s constitutional government movement is banned ; freedom of the press , assembly and association is restricted ; political tutorage , which according to the people &apos;s consensus should have been ended , is continued ; the delegates to the National Congress elected before the war of resistance are allowed to continue their tenure without a new election ; and the unsatisfactory organizational law of the National Congress is proclaimed valid .
All these are against the people &apos;s will and unsuitable to the needs of the war of resistance .
Our colleagues of this association wish to register their firm opposition .
We dare say that if these methods are used to carry out constitutional government , no internal or external problems can be resolved .
Unless drastic changes are made according to the people &apos;s will , the people &apos;s support cannot be rallied for the benefit of the war effort .
This is the first point we wish to declare to our fellow countrymen .
Second , the election law for the delegates to the National Congress must be thoroughly revised , and new elections must be held .
Although a few unbiased persons were elected to the National Congress before the war of resistance , most of the so @-@ called elections were phony .
The director of elections at that time was Chu Min @-@ i &#91; 5969 3046 1355 &#93; , now a traitor .
The entire show , masterminded by the Kuomintang , was full of scandals and a farce to our countrymen and the world .
Among those elected were traitors , spies , corrupt officials , local rascals and oppressive gentry .
With these people meeting together to write a constitution , the product undoubtedly will be a piece of useless , official @-@ sounding composition .
With these people convened to carry out constitutional government , the result undoubtedly will be the same one @-@ party dictatorship under a new name .
What they wish to do is for their own interests .
Why should they put on this superfluous act , using constitutional government as a front to camouflage their true intentions ?
The colleagues of this association wish to express their firm opposition to this .
At the same time , we suggest a revision of the law for electing delegates to the National Congress and the holding of a new election .
Only by so doing can we satisfy the needs of national unity and the war of resistance .
Other- ^ wise , we are following the wrong track with the wrong vehicle and exposing ourselves to ridicule .
This will never contribute to the good
fortune of our country .
This is the second point we wish to declare to our countrymen .
Third , the organizational law for the National Congress must be thoroughly revised , and the National Congress must be made an organization wielding supreme power in the land .
According to the original organizational law , the function of the National Congress is limited to writing a constitution and selecting a day for implementing the constitution .
Its function will come to an end after its adjournment .
The people in power are unwilling to see constitutional government really carried out and unwilling to make the National Congress a powerful organization for national salvation .
Behind this intention is the devilish desire to carry out one @-@ party dictatorship .
Members of this association are firmly against the organizational law of the National Congress , which does not suit the needs of the war of resistance .
We suggest that the organizational law be thoroughly revised and that the National Congress be made an organization wielding supreme power in the country .
First , the National Congress , aside from writing a constitution and selecting a date for implementation of the constitution , should be an organization to carry out the constitution .
Second , the National Congress should have the power to make basic policies for domestic affairs and foreign relations .
Third , the National Congress should have the power to elect , supervise and recall government officials .
Fourth , the National Congress should have the power to write laws for the country .
Fifth , the National Congress should establish a permanent office which will perform the function of the National Congress during its adjournment .
Only these suggestions , if carried out , will suit the needs of the national crisis and prevent the National Congress from degenerating into a window @-@ dressing device .
If we say that it is up to the constitution to decide which organization is to implement the constitution , then the organizational law for the National Congress should not give the National Congress in advance the power to implement the constitution .
This stipulation Is self @-@ deceiving and also deceives the public .
That the National Congress should be an organization wielding supreme power in the land was decided by Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen .
He said : &quot; After the promulgation of the constitution , the power of control over the central government should be exercised by the National Congress .
The National Congress has the power to elect and recall government officials and the power of Initiation and referendum for laws of the land . &quot; If the National Congress is not the organization to implement the constitution , then which organization should be trusted with this responsibility ?
Success depends upon sincerity .
If there is no sincerity in carrying out constitutional government , it would be better not to talk about the subject at all .
Sincerity in opening the government to the people , sincerity in implementing democracy , and sincerity in arousing the people to manage their task of self @-@ salvation and national salvation without resorting to expediency are the fundamental premises for convening the National Congress .
This is the third point we wish to declare to our countrymen .
Fourth , a penetrating constitutional movement should be started everywhere in the country .
People should have the freedom to discuss constitutional government and elect their delegates to the National Congress .
All anti @-@ Japanese political parties should have the legitimate right of existence , and their members should have the freedom to run for seats in the National Congress .
If there is no mass movement for constitutional government , if the people do not have freedom of speech , assembly and association , and if all anti @-@ Japanese political parties do not have the legitimate right of existence and the right to engage in legitimate activities , we are convinced that the so @-@ called constitutional government is nothing but empty and futile talk .
If these conditions are not changed , the constitution , no matter how well written , will be only a bunch of meaningless black characters .
No matter how much some people may claim that constitutional government is the result of their promotion a long time ago , constitutional government is but a coverup for one @-@ party monopoly of political power .
If these people sincerely reverse themselves and have the determination to join the people to make a new start , then they should begin by giving the people and all anti @-@ Japanese political parties and organizations the freedom to discuss constitutional government and the freedom to elect their own delegates to the National Congress .
This is the fourth point we wish to declare to our countrymen .
These four points represent the platform of our organization as well as the opinion of the people all over the country .
We are convinced that democratic constitutional government is an overwhelming tendency in China as well as in the world .
Although there are many obstacles , this objective will eventually be attained .
At this time , when our national enemy penetrates deep into our territory , democratization is the best policy for saving our country from perishing .
We also believe that the concerted effort of the Kuomintang , the Chinese Communist Party , all anti @-@ Japanese political parties , and all anti @-@ Japanese people will gradually put the country on the road to democratic constitutional government .
These are our deep convictions which we sincerely wish to convey to our fellow countrymen .
At the inception of this association , we take the courage to present our feelings to the authorities .
Why don &apos;t those who share our views join us !

DECLARATION OF THE CCP CENTRAL COMMITTEE ON THE CURRENT SITUATION IN COMMEMORATION OF THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE WAR OF RESISTANCE
7 July 1940
&#91; Text &#93; Fellow countrymen , officers and men of the armed forces , and anti @-@ Japanese comrades of all political parties !
On this great third anniversary of the war of resistance , the CCP Central Committee , with the utmost sincerity and the utmost enthusiasm , extends our national revolutionary salutation to our countrymen , officers and men on the front , and anti @-@ Japanese comrades of all political parties ; our deep sorrow for the martyrs who have given their lives to their country in the last 3 years ; and our deep concern for our wounded officers and men of the armed forces and our wounded countrymen .
The 3 years of war of resistance prove that Japanese imperialism is bound to collapse , China will never perish , and final victory will certainly belong to the Chinese nation , because Japanese imperialism has been greatly weakened during our 3 years of heroic resistance , a will to fight to the end has been fostered in the heart of the entire nation , and current changes in the international situation are basically favorable to China .
However , we also face a period of unprecedented difficulty for our war of resistance .
Japanese imperialism is stepping up its attack on China and has declared its Eastern Monroe Doctrine .
Some people on China &apos;s anti @-@ Japanese front are wavering .
As far as international conspiracy is concerned , it is quite possible that the peace mediation policy of Germany and Italy will take the place of the Eastern Munich policy of Great Britain , the United States and France .
The accelerated Japanese imperialist attack on China and the artillery and fighter @-@ bombers of Hitler and Mussolini are echoing each other in an attempt to achieve the objective of their imperialist warredivision of the world and enslavement of all the people of the world .
The suicidal policy of Great Britain , the United States and France , characterized by
their consistent hostility to the Soviet Union and yielding to Germany and Italy , has caused the tragic loss of France , serious setbacks to Great Britain , and a threat to U.S.
interests in the Atlantic and the Pacific .
The imperialist war has developed to a new stage , but the conflict among the imperialists has not come to an end .
The economic and political crises caused by the war of imperialism are threatening the survival of mankind and will inevitably lead to the explosion of a world revolution .
This revolution is brewing among all oppressed peoples and nations .
We are in a new era between war and revolution .
All wars of imperialism are wars for slaughtering people .
Only the great , prosperous socialist Soviet Union , not involved in the vortex ot imperialist wars , is the real helper of all oppressed peoples and nations .
The only reliable friends of China during its war of resistance are the Soviet Union and all the people of the world .
In the present international situation , Japanese imperialism , under the pressure of both internal and external crisis , is embarking upon its last adventure , attempting to block China &apos;s lines of communication with the outside worlds imposing increasing pressure and increasing difficulties on China by launching frontal attacks and aerial bombardment in order to split China and force it to surrender .
Under this increasing pressure and difficulty , the wavering elements in China will become more wavering and eventually will stumble onto the road of surrender .
These people are confused in their mind , weak in their will , unable to endure hardships , and unable to see the future of the war of resistance .
Once they are confronted with crisis or difficulty , they waver .
They are the most dangerous people on the anti @-@ Japanese front .
Fellow countrymen , officers and men , and anti @-@ Japanese comrades of all parties !
We are now in a stage fraught with unprecedented danger of surrender and unprecedented difficulties to our war of resistance .
We should not hide this danger and difficulty .
The Chinese Communist Party considers it its duty to remind our countrymen of this danger and difficulty and to point out that the entire country should be further unified to overcome this danger and difficulty .
Wang Ching @-@ wei &apos;s capitulation is now bankrupt .
He and his cohorts have become the meanest toys in the hands of Japanese imperialism .
The capitulation of the French bourgeois class has turned all French people into slaves of Hitler .
Surrender is absolutely not a solution .
The Chinese Communist Party is entirely sympathetic to the fate of the French people .
The Chinese Communist Party is firmly convinced that , under the strong leadership of the French Communist Party , the great French nation will not perish .
The struggle of the French people will be coordinated with the struggle of the Chinese people to defeat their external oppressors .
Fellow countrymen , officers and men , and anti @-@ Japanese comrades of all political parties !
We must resist any enemy attack , overcome any difficulty , oppose any conspiracy to surrender , and struggle to the end
against all capitulationist elements .
The entire nation must be further unified ; internal friction must be eliminated ; Kuomintang @-@ Chinese Communist Party relationships must be readjusted ; the danger of a civil war must be avoided ; the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front must be consolidated ; all the people of the country must carry out the war of resistance to the end under the leadership of Mr Chiang Kai @-@ shek ; and the promises of all political parties and factions must be fulfilled .
To our fellow countrymen and comrades of our friendly political parties , the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee announces : We always carry out our promises .
In our 22 September 1937 declaration we said that we would struggle for the thorough realization of the Three People &apos;s Principles , call off our land revolution , discard our policy of violence , rename the Red Army as the National Revolutionary Army , and change the name &quot; soviet &quot; to local democratic government .
We have earnestly carried out all these promises without reneging .
All the policies we have carried out in the Shensi @-@ Kansu @-@ Ninghsia border region , behind the enemy lines and in all anti @-@ Japanese bases , are entirely in conformity with the Three People &apos;s Principles .
We now declare again : During the entire period of the anti @-@ Japanese war and the period of establishing a democratic republic , we will always implement the Three People &apos;s Principles .
Any statement accusing the Chinese Communist Party of failure to carry out its promises is ill @-@ intentioned slander .
On this problem we demand that the Kuomintang also honor its promises and earnestly carry out all political promises and promises regarding certain problems made to the people and our party so as to benefit national unity and the war of resistance .
The Chinese Communist Party Central Committee announces : During the period of national unity for the war of resistance and Kuomintang @-@ Chinese Communist Party cooperation , it is absolutely forbidden to implement any policy of violence or sabotage within the country .
We have always supported Mr Cbiang Kai @-@ shek and the National Government &apos;s policy of carrying the war of resistance to the end , and we have always kept our promise of nonviolence and nonsabotage .
All the hearsay that the Chinese Communist Party will again adopt the old policy of violence and sabotage is nothing but rumors fabricated by traitors .
At the same time , we ask the Kuomintang to forego its policy of sabotage toward the Chinese Communist Party in order to insure the unity and long @-@ term cooperation between the two parties .
The Chinese Communist Party Central Committee announces : We shall restrain the anti @-@ Japanese armed units under our leadership and limit their activities within the designated war zone , behind the enemy lines , and within the 23 counties in the Shensi @-@ Kansu @-@ Ninghsia border region ; we shall not take any action in other areas that might cause conflict with our friendly armed units .
Within the designated war zone and behind the enemy lines , our armed units will cooperate with all friendly anti @-@ Japanese forces in the war against the enemy .
However , we demand that all friendly anti @-@ Japanese units also restrain their subordinates from taking any action toward the 8th Route Army and the New 4th Army that
might cause any conflict so as to insure unity on the anti @-@ Japanese front .
At the same time , we demand that the National Government give all possible assistance to the 8th Route Army , the New 4th Army and all anti @-@ Japanese guerrilla units , because they are on the forefront of our national defense .
In the last 3 years the 8th Route Army and the New 4th Army have heroically engaged the enemy in more than 10,000 large and small battles , persisted in the war of resistance over vast areas behind the enemy &apos;s frontlines , and tied down 40 @-@ 50 percent of the total enemy forces in China .
They are situated in the most dangerous positions .
They live under the most difficult conditions .
They suffer the worst shortage of ammunition .
The Chinese Communist Party Central Committee announces : We continue to carry out the resolution adopted in November 1938 at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee , namely , &quot; We shall not develop our party organisation in the friendly armed units . &quot; Those local party headquarters which have not yet strictly carried out this resolution should take corrective action .
Our party &apos;s policy toward all friendly anti @-@ Japanese armed units is to unite with them and strengthen them , not to split or destroy them .
However , we demand that the Kuomintarig and all other anti @-@ Japanese armed units adopt the same policy toward the 8th Route Army and the New 4th Army in order to eliminate mutual suspicion , conduct the war of resistance with one heart , and enable all armed units under the same supreme commander to fulfill their mission in fighting the enemy .
The colleagues of our party think : In order to overcome unprecedented danger of capitulation and the unprecedented difficulties in the war of resistance , the existing &quot; anticommunism , &quot; &quot; restrict communism , &quot; &quot; absorb communism , &quot; &quot; prevent communism , &quot; and &quot; control communism &quot; policies must be eliminated , because the implementation of these policies has the serious effect of weakening our strength against Japan and causes unrest in people &apos;s minds .
We should never adopt any policy for the war of resistance that will call for two warsone against the enemy within and another against the enemy without .
This kind of policy is suicidal .
China should take the anticommunist policy of the Daladier government in France as a warning .
The colleagues of our party think : In order to overcome the unprecedented danger of capitulation and the unprecedented difficulties in the war of resistance , we must change many of our methods .
We must implement freedom of speech , the press , assembly and association .
We must release all arrested Communist Party members and patriotic elements .
We must recognize the right to legitimate existence of all anti @-@ Japanese political parties .
We must convene a democratic National Congress .
We must abolish the harmful secret service @-@ like working style .
We must change all unsuitable financial and economic policies , cultural and educational policies , and the draft policy for the armed forces .
We must emphasize self @-@ reliance instead of reliance on unreliable foreign aid .
Fellow countrymen , officers and men of the armed forces , and anti @-@ Japanese comrades of all political parties !
The unprecedented danger of surrender and the unprecedented difficulties for the war of resistance are upon us .
We must overcome these dangers and difficulties .
The Chinese Communist Party is firmly convinced that these dangers and difficulties are entirely conquerable .
China is equipped with all the necessary conditions to overcome any danger and any difficulty if the Chinese Government and people will use these favorable conditions , China is a country with a vast territory , abundant resources and a large population .
China should never be compared with Abyssinia or Spain , not to mention Holland or Belgium .
China should not even be compared with France , Japan is far inferior to Germany .
China still has a large army with several million men .
It is strengthened by the unity among the Kuomintang , the Chinese Communist Party and the majority of the Chinese people .
It can take advantage of the internal contradictions among the imperialists .
It has the support of a strong Soviet Union and the world revolution .
Since the Opium War , China in the last 100 years has gone through numerous crises and obtained rich experiences .
Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s heroic struggle especially deserves to be the model for our nation .
During this serious national crisis we must carry out the great teachings bequeathed by Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen , his revolutionary Three People &apos;s Principles , his policy of uniting with the Soviet Union , his Three Great Policies for helping the peasants and workers , and his Testament .
We must do away with pessimistic , wavering and helpless feelings and continue to struggle unyieldingly .
Then the danger of surrender will be overcome , the war of resistance will be won , the task of national reconstruction will succeed , ancl the future of China as a nation will be boundlessly glorious !
Down with Japanese imperialism !
Carry the war of resistance to the end !
Be united to the end !
Long live Chinese national liberation !

CCP CENTRAL COMMITTEE SPOKESMAN ON THE SOUTHERN ANHWEI INCIDENT 18 January 1941
&#91; Text &#93; While under orders to move north , the New 4th Army , located south of the Yangtze River , suddenly was attacked by government troops .
This represents an attempt to quickly annihilate an anti @-@ Japanese armed unit .
As the news broke , the nation and the world were shocked .
A reporter of this newspaper was sent to see the spokesman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party .
He issued the following statement :
This tragic event is not accidental .
It is , in fact , a premeditated act on the part of pro @-@ Japanese conspirators and members of the stubborn anticommunist faction .
Shortly after the beginning of the war of resistance , the guerrillas of the Red Army in south China were reorganized as the New 4th Army of the National Revolutionary Army , In the last 3 years this army has fought strong enemy forces north and south of the Yangtze River and rendered meritorious services numerous times .
This is known not only to every one of our countrymen but also to the world .
By ordinary reasoning , these outstanding anti @-@ Japanese units should be well cherished .
Unfortunately , as the nation is confronted with a strong enemy and as the national crisis is worsening , the people in power fail to adhere to the principle of &quot; national interest first &quot; and &quot; war of resistance first , &quot; cling to their 10 @-@ year @-@ old antlcommunist prejudice , and always discriminate against the armed units led by the Chinese Communist Party .
Incidents of humiliation , cruel treatment , besiege , and sneak attacks on our troops occur repeatedly .
This treatment of the New 4th Army , of course , is no exception .
In central Hupeh the Li Hsien @-@ nien battalion of this army was attacked numerous times by Ch &apos;eng Ju @-@ huai &#91; 4453 3067 2037 &#93; and others .
In southern Kiangsu the Chen I &#91; 7115 3015 &#93; unit was repeatedly under the pressure of Leng Hsin &#91; 0397 2946 &#93; .
In northern Kiangsu the troops under Kuan Wen @-@ wei &#91; 4619 2429 5588 &#93; were oppressed by Haii Te @-@ ch &apos;in &#91; 7281 1795 0530 &#93; .
The units under Lo Ping @-@ hui &#91; 5012 3521 6540 &#93; in eastern Anhwei and the units under Peng Hsueh @-@ feng &#91; 1756 7185 2000 &#93;
located north of the Huai River were under the oppression of Li P &apos;in @-@ hsien &#91; 2621 0756 0341 &#93; .
Many of the rearguard personnel and the wounded officers and men of the New 4th Army in Ping @-@ chiang and western Honan were murdered .
These notorious incidents were known as the Ping @-@ chiang massacre and the Chueh @-@ shan massacre .
The wife and young son of Chang Yun @-@ i &#91; 1728 0061 6654 &#93; , chief of staff of the New 4th Army , were arrested .
These incidents which have occurred in the last few years are well known to everybody .
In the last few months the situation has become worse .
Massive attacks were launched in northern Kiangsu , eastern Anhwei and central Hupeh in the name of &quot; eliminating the bandits . &quot; These campaigns loomed large along the Yangtze and the Huai rivers .
Also , on 19 October 1940 Ho Ying @-@ ch &apos;in &#91; 0149 2019 2953 &#93; and Pai Ch &apos;ung @-@ hsi &#91; 4101 1504 4406 &#93; , in their respective capacities as the general chief of staff and deputy general chief of staff , telegraphed Chu Teh and P &apos;eng Te @-@ huai , commander in chief and deputy commander in chief , respectively , of the 18th Combined Army Corps , Yeh T &apos;ing &#91; 5509 2185 &#93; and Hsiang Ying &#91; 7309 5391 &#93; , commander and deputy commander of the New 4th Army , instructing all units of the New 4th Army and the 8th Route Army to assemble before a definite date in an area north of the Yellow River .
In the telegram they stressed the so @-@ called &quot; military administration &quot; and &quot; military order . &quot; In view of the interest of the country , Chu , P &apos;eng , Yeh and Hsiang promised in their reply cable to move the units of the New 4th Army located south of the Yangtze River to the north .
By the end of December all preparations for the move had been completed by Yeh T &apos;ing .
When the troops were about to move , the Kuomintang press unexpectedly released a news report about the troop movement .
This constituted an act of informing the enemy of our military secrets .
At the same time , we heard that Ku Chu @-@ t &apos;ung &#91; 7357 4376 0681 &#93; and Shang @-@ huan Yun @-@ hsiang &#91; 0006 1351 0061 4161 &#93; had been ordered by the government authorities to attack .
The order included such words as &quot; catch them all in one net and capture Yeh and Hsiang alive . &quot; Ostensibly , however , the government authorities had given orders to all government units to help the Hew 4th Army travel through their territory without causing any difficulty .
Commander Yeh T &apos;ing presumed that these words uttered by the responsible authorities were trustworthy .
He started the troop movement on 4 January .
The number of troops and officers of the New 4th Army Headquarters totaled about 10,000 .
No sooner had they started moving than they were attacked .
When they reached Mou @-@ lin village between Ching @-@ hsien and Tai ~ ping , they were surrounded and attacked by the 52d Division led by TTang Yun @-@ shan &#91; 0781 0061 1472 &#93; , the 108th Division led by Jung Chi @-@ wu &#91; 2051 4764 0063 &#93; , the 79th Division led by Tuan Mou @-@ lin &#91; 3008 5399 2651 &#93; , the 144th Division led by Fan Tzu @-@ ying &#91; 5400 1311 5391 &#93; , the 40th Division led by Chan Chung @-@ yen &#91; 6124 1813 6056 &#93; , the new 7th Division led by T &apos;ien Chung @-@ yi &#91; 3944 4429 3015 &#93; , and the 10th Division led by Wang Ching @-@ hsiu &#91; 3769 0513 0208 &#93; , totaling more than 70,000 men and all under the command of Ku Chu @-@ t &apos;ung and Shang @-@ kuan Yun @-@ hsiang .
While hastily responding to the attack , Commander Yeh T &apos;ing cabled the government asking the reason for this attack .
During the 7 days and 7 nights of bloody fighting , the government authorities kept lying that they had cabled Ku Chu @-@ tTung to inquire about the true situation .
Actually , all government troops were under secret orders to carry out the plan to wipe out the New 4th Army .
On the 13th , when the fierce battle was in its 8th day , the ambushed New 4th Array , on the move under government orders , exhausted its ammunition and food supply .
The entire force was sacrificed .
The government &apos;s objective had been achieved .
On the 17th , the Military Council of the Kational Government issued a formal announcement declaring the New 4th Army a rebellious unit and straightforwardly admitting the annihilation of the New 4th Army units in southern Anhwei .
It also said that Yeh T &apos;ing had been wounded and captured and that the deputy commander , Hsiang Ying , had fled .
It also announced the elimination of the New 4th Army as an army unit and said that Yeh TTing would be court @-@ martialed .
Such a dignified announcement had in fact exposed to all the people of the country a conspiracy to annihilate an anti @-@ Japanese unit .
Coincidentallya on the 17th the Japanese KYODO news agency issued a startling report from Nanking .
It said in brief : &quot; The Chungking government has ordered the communist troops stationed south of the lower Yangtze to move to the north of the river before 26 December .
In order to prompt the communist troops to move , the commanders of the Third War Zone have started surrounding and attacking the New 4th Army and other communist troops in the vicinity of Tung @-@ liu .
Some of the defeated communist troops retreated from Ti @-@ kang to the north of the Yangtze on the 10th .
The Japanese Army also attacked the New 4th Army in the vicinity of Hsuan @-@ cheng and Ching @-@ tan .
The pacification units of the &apos; national government1 also assisted the Japanese Army in the battle . &quot; At this time the true facts of a great conspiracy and a tragic massacre to eliminate an anti @-@ Japanese armed unit and to crush those different from themselves were further bared to the world .
The so @-@ called northward move within a specified time limit was but a cunning trick to lure our troops into a trap so that they could be surrounded , attacked and wiped out .
The so @-@ called military discipline and the law of the nation meant that those who survived the slaughter were declared rebels and would be turned over to the courts for trial .
The old tunes glorifying the solemnity of military discipline and the sacredness of the law of the nation are nothing but alibis for intrigues to murder the opponents of those who are in power .
The New 4th Army is an anti @-@ Japanese armed unit , and its northward move was made in compliance with government orders , but the army was surrounded and annihilated .
Where is military discipline ?
Where is the law of the nation ?
The violators of orders were those who gave the orders .
The lawbreakers are those who made the law .
There should be no more argument about this .
When the New 4th Army south of the Yangtze was under attack , the government authorities also ordered more than 200,000 men under the command of Tang En @-@ po &#91; 3282 1869 0130 &#93; , Li P &apos;in @-@ hsien &#91; 2621 0756 0103 &#93; , Li Hsien @-@ chou &#91; 2621 0103 3166 &#93; , Wang Chung @-@ lien &#91; 3769 0112 1670 &#93; and Han Te @-@ ch &apos;in &#91; 7281 1795 0530 &#93; to stage a massive attack on the New 4th Army stationed north of the Yangtze .
The so @-@ called &quot; catch them all in one net &quot; plan was not limited to the area south of the Yangtze River .
Meanwhile , in northwest China the Shensi @-@ Kansu @-@ Ninghsia border region was encircled by more than
200,000 troops .
In Sian , government secret service agents , aside from blockading the office of the 8th Route Army , even kidnaped a water carrier of the office a few days ago and compelled him to put poison in the drinking water .
In Kweilin the police and government military units compelled the local offices of the 8th Route Army and the New 4th Army to close down immediately .
A dossier of Communist Party members and progressive elements in the entire country has been compiled .
Probably , it will not be too long before they &quot; catch them all with one net . &quot; In view of these facts , there is a tendency that the tragedy of civil war will be repeated .
There is a possibility that the heroic 3 1 / 2 @-@ year @-@ old war of resistance will be abandoned .
The shameful criminal act of eliminating the New 4th Army in southern Anhwei is only an exposed part of the entire intrigue .
This is only the beginning of the scenario of the pro @-@ Japanese elements , conspirators and stubborn anticommunist factions who wish to replace the war of resistance with a civil war and replace national unity with a split .
This kind of lawless criminal act in favor of the enemy can never be tolerated by the hundreds of thousands of Communist Party members and hundreds of thousands of officers and men of the 8th Route Army and the New 4th Army .
Even the military , civilians , and patriotic fellow countrymen and those in the entire world who advocate righteousness cannot stand idly by .
We appeal to all patriotic soldiers and civilians of the country and call upon all righteous people of the world sympathetic to China &apos;s national liberation to unite with us in our joint struggle to achieve the following goals :
Severely punish the leaders who conspired and perpetrated the crime of annihilating the New 4th Army in southern Anhwei !
Release all captured officers and men of the New 4th Army !
Protect the lives and safety of Commander Yeh T &apos;ing and other military and political cadres !
Give compensation to the family members of officers and men of the New 4th Army who were killed or wounded !
Stop the anticommunist war in central China involving several hundreds of thousands of troops !
Lift the anticommunist blockade in northwest China !
Stop the criminal act of killing and arresting Communist Party members and patriotic personalities throughout the country and release all patriotic political prisoners !
Get rid of Ho Ying @-@ ching and all other pro @-@ Japanese elements !
Oppose all intrigues to sabotage the war of resistance and destroy national unity !
Tighten up the anti @-@ Japanese front and persist in the war against Japan to the end !
We are deeply convinced that most of our armed and civilian countrymen of various political parties and nonpartisan countrymen take the fate of our country seriously and stand on the same line with us in opposition to those few pro @-@ Japanese elements and in breaking up their shameful intrigues to sell out our country through civil strife and peace with the enemy .
The Chinese nation is facing its most serious crisis in the war of resistance .
We communists and most of the soldiers and civilians in the country know very well what our duties are and what measures we should take during this critical situation .

PROTEST AGAINST A CAPITAL CRIME 1 February 1941
&#91; Text &#93; The New Year Day open wire of Chu , P &apos;eng , Yeh , and Hsiang protesting the ambush of the New 4th Army states : &quot; When our South China New 4th Army Headquarters and 10,000 troops , led by Yen T &apos;ing and others , followed orders to move north , we suddenly were ambushed by 70,000 Kuomintang troops in the Mao @-@ lin area south of Ching @-@ hsien .
Under waves of siege , from beginning to end , we fought bloody battles for 7 days and 7 nights .
The casualties were heavy , and we were out of ammunition and provisions . &quot; Upon hearing such news , one is shocked and angry .
This act of violating their own military orders , disobeying the laws of the state , destroying their own countrymen , and damaging the strength of the nation is truly outrageous to the extreme !
arrests and killings as well as raids on the various offices of the 8th Route Army in the entire country .
In the Northwest they are building a Great Wall of blockade ; in Central China they are deploying over 20 divisions of regular troops for a large @-@ scale attack . &quot; One can thus see that the pro @-@ Japanese conspirators and diehard anticommunist elements are committing the heinous crimes of starting a civil war to sabotage the resistance war and creating a split to destroy unity !
As chief and assistant chief of the General Staff of the Military Com @-@ missiona Ho Ying @-@ ch &apos;in and Pai Ch &apos;ung @-@ hsi sent the wires of the 19th and the 8th demanding that the headquarters and troops of the southern Anhwei New 4th Army withdraw northward .
Yet the order to move north was part of the ambush plot !
While the order forcing the New 4th Army to withdraw was being issued , another order was given to attack the troops which were withdrawing as ordered .
Given such contradictions , where is the solemnity of orders ?
Where is the integrity of the chief of the General Staff ?
While time and again issuing orders for the headquarters and the southern Anhwei troops of the New 4th Army to withdraw northward , the Military Commission and Ku Chu @-@ t &apos;ung of the Third Military Region designated southern Kiangsu as the route of withdrawal .
When the troops of the New 4th Army followed orders to proceed to southern Kiangsu , they were ambushed by 70,000 Kuomintang troops !
Given such vicious means , where are the righteousness , integrity , and ethics of the Central Government proclaimed by Ho and Pai ?
At the time when the headquarters and the South China troops of the New 4th Army were enticed into an ambush , the military authorities , while issuing the order to &quot; catch them all in one net ; capture Yeh and Hsiang alive , &quot; made promises that the troops stationed along the way would not interfere with the withdrawal .
Callous and inhuman , they say one thing but mean another .
Where are the laws of the state ?
Where is the integrity of the authorities ?
Alas !
Orders !
Orders !
Military discipline !
Military discipline !
Endless crimes in the world are committed in thy names !
One can thus see that those who disobey orders are the very ones who issue them ; those who violate the laws are the very ones who formulate them .
Hereafter , the soldiers and civilians of the entire nation will recognize even more clearly that those who proclaim vociferously the solemnity of military orders and the sanctity of state laws are merely using them as excuses to further their own selfish ends and damage the nation and the people !
When Germany , Italy and Japan criticized Roosevelt for violating international law by rendering aid to the British , Roosevelt stated openly in his message to the 77th Congress : &quot; The international law proclaimed by the dictators is a one @-@ sided thing .
It lacks the spirit of mutual
observance ; it only serves as a tool of oppression . &quot; We will borrow his words to present to China &apos;s dictators and conspirators , who respect and admire Roosevelt most .
In other words , &quot; the military orders and state laws proclaimed by the hypocrites &apos;are things created by them according to their own wishes .
They lack the spirit of mutual observance ; they are only the tools to oppress and destroy the dissenters . &quot;
Discrepancy in words and deeds ; benefiting oneself at the expense of othersthese are the nature of the class represented by those people .
In regard to those without righteousness , integrity and ethics , one actually should not blame them for not being righteous , honest or ethical .
As stated in an ancient Chinese proverb , &quot; what they say are righteousness , integrity and ethics , but what they do are robbery and prostitution . &quot; It is an apt portrayal of those people .
Their words and deeds , as precisely described by Lu Hsun , are &quot; ethics contrary to the conduct of the Chinese people ! &quot;
Nevertheless , what they do today does not concern only the issue of their personal ethics and integrity but that of the destiny of the state and the nation .
Their conspiracy to replace unity with a split and their crime to substitute a civil war for the resistance war are actually great wrongs done by them to help the enemy and the puppet and damage the republic !
Their heinous crimes not only are intolerable to our communist 8th Route and New 4th armies , but the majority of soldiers and civilians in the entire nation who love truth and justice cannot remain on the sidelines .
We appeal to our military and civilian countrymen of the entire nation and the just people of the whole world to unite with us and
Struggle to punish the conspiratorial ringleaders !
Struggle for the withdrawal of the troops exterminating the communists in Central China !
Struggle for the destruction of the Northwest anticommunist blockade !
Struggle for the cessation of the nationwide slaughter !
Struggle to avert the perdition of the Chinese nation !
We deeply believe : Righteousness will overcome wickedness !
Light will overcome darkness !

The Political Council wired the seven council members on 6 March urging their attendance .
Upon receipt of the wire , the seven council members replied on 8 March , explaining in detail their reasons for not attending the meeting .
The original text of the wire is as follows :
Secretariat of the People &apos;s Political Council and the entire council membership :
We received your wire of &quot; yu , &quot; and we are most grateful for your concern .
That the Chinese Communist Party members have exhausted their minds and bodies to continue the national resistance war and safeguard domestic unity in the past 4 years has long been publicly recognized by the people of the country ; that the Political Council members of the Chinese Communist Party attended every council meeting is also known to you all .
Nevertheless , for this session of the Political Council there are those who block our attendance .
The council members of the Chinese Communist Party were invited by the government .
Yet recently the government has been regarding the Chinese Communist Party almost as an enemy , exterminating the troops it leads , arresting and killing its members , and interdicting Its newspapers .
The southern Anhwei incident and the 17 January order , especially , were momentous matters since the advent of the resistance war and were seriously detrimental to domestic unity .
After the issuance of the 17 January order , the enemy and the bogus government applauded , while the people of the country seethed with anger , &#91; words illegible &#93; All felt that a split between the Kuomintang and the
Communist Party was imminent .
In view of this dangerous situation , the Chinese Communist Party Central had no choice but to take appropriate steps to avert the danger and protect unity .
It proposed 12 articles of remedial measures .
After an entire month there has been no reply , while the political oppression and military attacks have become more aggravated than ever before .
The New 4th Army has become a rebel army ; the 8th Route Army is branded as bandit troops ; the Communist Party is called a cabal .
Meanwhile , such alarming slogans as &quot; knock down the Communist Party on the Yenan @-@ Chungking road , &quot; &quot; resisting Japan and exterminating the bandits are of equal importance , &quot; and &quot; exterminating the bandits is not civil war &quot; are written in large letters on the walls by the government and the regular troops .
If this situation is not changed , even if we want to come to the meeting , it is impossible for us to do so .
We expressed our feelings in a wire to the Secretariat , of the Political Council , and we trust you understood them .
Subsequently , many Political Council members tried to mediate , and we were grateful for their sincerity .
In consideration of the overall situation , Tung Pi @-@ wu and Teng Yin @-@ chTao , our council members in Chungking , proposed 12 articles of provisional measures for action by the government , so that the council members of our party could attend the meeting .
Our idea was transmitted to the Secretariat of the Political Council , but we have not been favored with a reply .
The remedial and provisional measures we proposed were conditions presented to the government , which invited us to serve as members of the Political Council , for its action , which would serve as the criterion to determine whether we should attend the meeting .
As the government has the freedom to act or not to act , we also have the freedom to attend or not to attend .
Our support of the Political Council remains unchanged .
If , by your effort during this session and the decisive action of the gentlemen in the government , our measures are adopted , and if there are a resolution to that effect and a guarantee of performance , then , even if it is toward the end of the session , our council members in Chungking will follow your orders and attend .
Otherwise , we will have to wait until the issues are resolved .
That we accepted the invitations of the government was for the sake of unity and resistance war .
As long as the deep gash inflicted by the southern Anhwei incident is not mended , it will be difficult for us to attend any conference called by the government .
This is the reason why our current situation is not entirely identical with yours .
We respectfully express our feelings , and we hope for your understanding .

COMMUNIST PARTY COMMENTS ON STATEMENT OF 8TH KUOMINTANG CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING AND CRIANG KAI @-@ SHEK &apos;S SPEECH
5 April 1941
&#91; Text &#93; Though Chiang Kai @-@ shek openly admits the existence of a crisis in his regime , he has not realized that the cause of the crisis is the absence of democracy .
That the Central Committee meeting , in its declaration , not only does not rectify the criminal act of ambushing the New 4th Army , but even stresses the so @-@ called military order and military discipline , is truly a great mistake .
The Communist Party hopes that the Kuomintang will improve , but the only way for it to truly improve is to accept the 12 articles of remedial measures proposed by the Communist Party and sincerely implement them .
Hsin @-@ hua Press , Yenan , 5 AprilIn regard to Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s speech and the declaration of the Eighth Kuomintang Central Committee Meeting , the Communist Party published the following comments :
people &apos;s freedoms of thought , speech , and publication have been almost completely eliminated , and the situation is becoming worse .
However , the calculations and measures of the Kuomintang authorities are wrong .
The people * s indignation has risen with the political pressure and economic exploitation of the large bourgeoisie , while the crisis of a split resulting from the ambush of the New 4th Army has further aggravated the people &apos;s dissatisfaction toward the Kuomintang regime .
As a result , Chiang Kai @-@ shek had no choice but to admit the truth of the crisis in his regime .
He asks the Kuomintang members to introspect , but he has no intention of eliminating the true cause of the crisis .
What is the cause ?
In a word , it is the absence of democracy .
As long as the conflict between the Kuomintang regime and the people &apos;s interests exists , the crisis will exist .
Meanwhile , for a rapprochement between the Kuomintang and the people there is no other way than democracy .
In his speech Chiang never once mentioned democratic politics .
&quot; Becoming one with the people &quot; is merely an empty phrase or an indication of his desire to reinforce secret service work .
As for the declaration of the Central Committee meeting , it clearly indicates that constitutional government has been postponed to &quot; the conclusion of the war . &quot; The constitutional government for which the people and the parties and factions of the entire country have appealed for the purpose of strengthening national unity in the resistance war has been laid aside .
Next , for China3 an oppressed nation , to rise and resist a powerful enemy , short of arming the entire populace , it will be impossible to win final victory .
Yet the Kuomintang authoritiesa under the excuse of &quot; military orders and military discipline , &quot; seek to destroy the people &apos;s armed force , using &quot; military orders and military discipline &quot; as the tools to eliminate dissenters .
The act of ambushing and exterminating the New 4th Army , for instance , actually was a crime against the resistance war , yet the Central Committee meeting , in its declaration , failed to rectify the mistake .
On the contrary , it stressed the so @-@ called &quot; military orders and military discipline &quot; for the unprincipled conspiracy to destroy the troops fighting the resistance war .
It cannot but be considered an error of understanding .
In regard to &quot; economic construction &quot; in the declaration of the Central Committee meeting , while it negates , on the one hand , the necessity to improve the people &apos;s living standard , branding it as &quot; inciting class struggle , &quot; it continues , on the other hand , the so @-@ called economic control , which has many defects and benefits the exploitation by a minority of the large bourgeois elements , and it denies free economic development in order to discourage the national industrial and commercial bourgeoisie and the broad petty bourgeoisie .
If such an erroneous economic policy is not changed , it is quite apparent that the currently developing economic crisis will not be surmounted .
Yet it can only be changed under democratic politics .
In sum , we hope the Kuomintang will improve , because its improvement will benefit the national resistance war .
But if the Kuomintang authorities do not fundamentally reexamine their errors or the true cause of the degeneration and decadence of their party , but only deal with the symptoms , there will definitely be no result .
The
only way for the Kuomintang to make any true improvement is to accept the 12 articles of remedial measures proposed by the Communist Party and conscientiously implement them .
Treating the symptoms without fundamental changes in policy will serve no purpose .

TAKE NOTE WHO IS THE TRUE RULER OF OUR COUNTRY TODAY 18 May 1941
&#91; Text &#93; Those assessing the tendency of Japanese imperialism often start from the subjective needs of the Japanese radicals in regard to the United States , i.e. , the fascists , and forget the factor which exists objectively and serves as the major determinant of Japan &apos;s tendency .
Such is the case with the Kuomintang people as well as others since the formation of the three @-@ nation Axis .
The current international situation has three major characteristics : One is Germany &apos;s great success ; two is China &apos;s developing anti @-@ Japanese war ; three is Russia &apos;s peace policy .
In our general assessment of international issues and special assessment of the Japan issue , we cannot depart from these three characteristics .
Those who fail to see them , or underestimate their importance , will inevitably arrive at incorrect , or not very correct , conclusions .
German imperialism has conquered all of Europe outside the Soviet Union and is pushing toward Africa and the Near East , continuing its large @-@ scale bombing of the British Isles , and developing submarine warfare in the Atlantic , thus indicating its tendency to seize world supremacy .
England and America , which struggle against it for such supremacy , have no choice but to wage a desperate fight .
America &apos;s prompt preparation to enter the war is a result of this situation .
In this situation , the plan of British and American imperialism is to concentrate forces against Germany .
According to their assessment , as long as the British Isles hold , they will be able to utilize their naval superiority , regain their command of the air , force Hitler eastward , and make him clash with the Soviet Union .
With heaven &apos;s help , once the anti @-@ Soviet faction in Germany is provoked and a war between Germany and the Soviet Union breaks out , their &quot; plan &quot; will have &quot; succeeded . &quot; Blocking Hitler from moving west , preventing the Soviet Union from remaining uninvolved , and starting another European Munich constitute their general policy .
In the Far East , utilizing the internal conflicts of the three @-@ nation Axis , dismantling the Tokyo @-@ Berlin Axis , bribing Japan and dragging it into their
camp , creating a Far Eastern Munich , taking advantage of the conflicts between China and Japan and between the Soviet Union and Japan , and forcing Japan toward the west and the north in coordination with their policy to force Germany toward the east constitute the &quot; ingenious trick &quot; of British and U.S.
imperialism .
The more successful Germany becomes , the greater will be the effort of the British and American gentlemen to seek out the weak points of Germany and Japan while aiming all their schemes at the Soviet Union .
Every time a crisis arises , they will always try to extricate themselves at the expense of the Soviet Union .
Such is the pattern they devised long ago .
In regard to Japan , Germany &apos;s success serves as an encouragement to its ruling class to profit by the occasion , because the energy of England and America is drawn to the Atlantic , not the Pacific .
On this issue , while each of the three factions of Japan &apos;s rulers ( the pro @-@ Germany and Italy fascist faction , the pro @-@ British and America status quo faction , and the intermediate faction between the two ) , in the distribution of political power , wishes to utilize every opportunity in the changes in the international situation unfavorable to the others to further its own goal , they are unanimous when it comes to taking advantage of the conflicts in the west ( conflicts between England and Germany , between America and Germany , and between Russia and Germany ) to advance JapanTs goal of expansion ; they can again unite , because they find it more advantageous to let Hitler shoulder the heavy burden of England and America and attract the attention of the Soviet Union to the west , while they , themselves , sit atop the mountain to watch the tigers fight and reap the benefit .
In the three @-@ nation Axis , Japan is different from Italy , which serves as Hitler &apos;s foot soldier .
Japan is of a semi @-@ independent nature .
In regard to orders which coincide only with Hitler &apos;s wishes but conflict with Japan &apos;s wishes , such as starting a Pacific war immediately , Japan will not obey them .
Starting a Pacific war immediately is made impossible by Japan &apos;s war in China , its national strength , and the internal conflicts among its rulers .
This has created certain comedies in the liaison between Japan and England and America in recent months , especially in the recent week .
Such comedies can only be explained from the fact that both England and America , on the one hand , and Japan , on the other , are willing to avoid a Pacific war temporarily ( not permanently ) , the only difference being that one side wishes to concentrate on Germany while the other side wishes to concentrate on China and sit atop the mountain to watch the tigers fight in the West in order to reap the benefit in the future .
Nevertheless , it is a bucket of cold water as far as the ruling figures of the Chinese Kuomintang are concerned , because , with the formation of the three @-@ nation Axis , they have been hoping daily for salvation in a war between Japan and the United States .
But their Roosevelt does not want to consider their supplications , and Japan &apos;s intent is also contrary to their desire .
We feel that this is the way to view the changes in the international situation resulting from Germany &apos;s success .
Many have underestimated the developing resistance war in China .
Some even feel that Japan may leave China alone , march south , and start a war with America .
To their surprise , it has turned out to be otherwise .
What fundamentally determines Japan &apos;s tendency is precisely Chinathe majestic China confronting it , becoming ever more aware and waging an ever more vigorous resistance war .
China today is a conflagration of national revolution .
Hundreds of millions here are raising high the torches , and the Communist Party stands in the frontline of their ranks .
In the 2 1 / 2 years since they occupied Wuch &apos;ang @-@ Hankow , the Japanese rulers have followed the policy of easing up on the Communist Party and inducing the surrender of the Kuomintang .
But the policy has failed .
The Communist Party is becoming ever more consolidated as the fighting goes on , while the Kuomintang hesitates over surrendering .
What is regrettable is that the ruling figures in our friendly party have failed to improve the government and reinforce unity .
On the contrary , they have launched anticomtnunist campaigns twice in these past 2 1 / 2 years , copying the ways of the Japanese , concentrating on fighting the communists , and slackening the resistance of Japan , as if to say : We are devoting our full force against the communists ; you Japanese can freely launch a war against America and stop attacking us .
But Japanese imperialism does not listen to these words .
What it wants is all of China .
It desires not only to &quot; oppose the communists &quot; but also to &quot; exterminate the Kuomintang . &quot; The Japanese say : If you want us to stop advancing , you must surrender , and you must launch a total war against the communists ; just a southern Anhwei incident is insufficient .
Since the southern Anhwei incident , the Japanese have exerted a great effort to provoke a war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party .
Nevertheless , as the Communist Party Central is doing its utmost for the general situation , while the major leaders of the Kuomintang are unwilling to be tricked by Japan , its provocations have gone bankrupt , and it has been forced to deploy its troops for risky attacks , which it is unwilling to do .
This is the reason for the suddenly tense war situation in recent days .
We can definitely say that , as a result of the unity between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and the ever @-@ developing people &apos;s resistance war , the flames against Japanese imperialism will only burn ever stronger , and Japanese imperialism will perish in China &apos;s conflagration .
Naturally , it is a great help to England and America , restraining Japan from marching south and making it possible for them to concentrate on Germany .
But they do not have any love for China .
They are selfish imperialists .
As long as Japan does not launch a Pacific war , they are willing to give it many things , such as rubber , oil , cotton , machinery and everything else one can think of .
But that is only secondary ; even sacrificing China and Dutch Indonesia is in the bag of tricks of Roosevelt and Churchill .
A new danger of a Far Eastern Munich is definitely not something impossible .
Nevertheless , as long as China exerts itself and continues its effort , let Japan point its spearhead westward , we will throw our torches eastward and fight a great duel .
It is entirely possible to defeat Japan .
Hampered
by the great China , Japan has no choice but to temporarily avoid a Pacific war .
What basically determines Japan * s tendency is China , just as Japan is the basic factor determining China &apos;s tendency .
They are merely two sides of the same thing .
As for the peace policy of the Soviet Union , one may say that it serves as a brake to the entire world .
Its force will overcome the conspiracies of all the imperialist reactionaries .
Regardless of the dreams of England and America that Hitler &apos;s fire of war will burn eastward , or any other anti @-@ Soviet conspiracies , one day they will become a pile of scrap metal .
The defection of Hess proved the failure of the most recent great conspiracy of England and America .
A new understanding between Germany and the Soviet Union has been reached and the danger of a new Munich in Europe averted .
It was the victory o Stalin &apos;s invocation of the &quot; east wind . &quot; It is the same in the East as in the West .
No matter how much England and America try to create a Far Eastern Munich and mobilize all their disciples iu Japan and China , it will serve no purpose .
The Monkey God had no way of leaping out of the palm of Buddha .
England and America have no way of stopping China &apos;s resistance war .
China * s resist @-@ Japan torch has Stalin to add oil to it , and one can count on him to do so .
If Japanese imperialism should recklessly launch an attack on China &apos;s western territory , one can count on its being burned , because China has not only an unsevered Kuomintang @-@ Communist cooperation but also an evergrowing Sino @-@ Soviet cooperation .
Failure to see the peace policy of the Soviet Union , or underestimating it , is also definitely incorrect .
Will Japan not push south ?
It will push south .
But currently it must first advance west , recklessly wishing to solve the China issue first .
It hopes to utilize the present to let Hitler attack England and America ferociously , while it fiercely assails China .
It attempts to sever the two communication lines in China &apos;s Northwest and Southwest and connect the Peking @-@ Hankow railway line .
After a spell of fierce attacks it will follow with a spell of soft assault , activating its fifth columnists ( those like Ho Ying @-@ ch &apos;in ) and vigorously resorting to the means of associating in order to attain its goal of inducing surrender .
Attacking and associating are Japan &apos;s two great feats of magic .
We predict that a surrender crisis may arise at a certain time , and we must be prepared .
Japan1s wishful planning is probably thus : It will solve , or generally solve , the China issue within not too long a period of time .
By the time England and America can pay even less attention to the East , then you might as well hand over the Pacific ; otherwise I will attack you .
Anyway , by that time I can do &quot; as I please . &quot; As for the subjective planning of all imperialists , one must not regard it as the outcome .
Their subjective planning and the final outcome are either fundamentally opposite or far apart .
This should be the way to regard the planning of Japanese imperialism .
Since it wishes to &quot; first solve &quot; the China issue , let it try once again .
Since its so @-@ called &quot; plan &quot; for China has failed many times , let it fail once again .
This is entirely possible .
No reactionary in the world knows how to assess the development of the
revolutionary strength .
This point will lead to the downfall of the reactionaries .
To whom does the world actually belong ?
The imperialist bandits will claim it as theirs , but the people will claim it as theirs .
To whom does China actually belong ?
The Japanese imperialist will claim it as his , but we will claim it as the Chinese people &apos;s .
&quot; Take a look at the country today : To whom does it belong ? &quot; Only the people , only we , can correctly answer this question .
The right , the correct , can only be the people , us , definitely not the enemy , not them .
People of the entire nation , unite to resist Japanese imperialism !
We have every confidence in victory !

YENAN COMMENTATOR ON CURRENT AFFAIRS
24 May 1941
&#91; Text &#93; An observer in Yenan commented on the current situation :
( 1 ) Recently , while on the one hand mobilizing troops for a gigantic new onslaughts Japanese imperialism on the other hand has been planning a new conspiracy to induce surrender .
The military situation is tense on the front while rumors of peace are widespread in Hong Kong and Shanghai .
Thus , the Japanese bandits implement their dual policy of hitting and dragging simultaneously , ( 2 ) Certain imperialist authorities also follow the dual policy : While rendering some slight aid to China , they continue to seek a compromise with Japan and plan our surrender .
The new conspiracy of a Far Eastern Munich has leaked from the New York Stock Exchange to the whole world .
The talks between Matsuoka and ( Ko @-@ lu ) were not for no purpose .
( 3 ) Certain authorities in Chungking also pursue the dual policy : While continuing the resistance war , they have not blocked the path of compromise ; while willing to coordinate with the 8th Route Army in combat , they do not abandon the anticommunist policy or furnish supplies to the 8th Route Army , and they continue to create anticommunist rumors .
Such dual policies make it impossible to carry on the resistance war , easily generate a feeling of pessimism , and aggravate the situation of confusion .
Recently , the news of &quot; peace &quot; in the Far East spread by UNITED PRESS , ZEITUNG PRESSE and other press agencies has not been denied by the Chinese , American , and Japanese authorities concerned .
Therefore , the current situation urgently requires the attention of our countrymen , while the key to overcoming all kinds of dangers rest inside , not outside , i.e. , the decisive abandoning by the Kuomintang authorities of the dual policy , which is detrimental to the unity of the resistance war .

RUMOR AND SMOKESCREEN 28 May 1941
&#91; Text &#93; Creating rumors is a common trick of riffraff of the marketplace , yet political vagrants resort to such despicable means in political struggles and actually call it &quot; spreading rational hearsay . &quot;
In social and political struggles , holding in their hands the banner of justice and truth , the progressive class and progressive political party are not afraid of openly and frankly announcing their political program and goal to the broad masses , clarifying their own political tasks and the direction of their political action , and waging an open and solemn struggle against the current major enemy .
They have no need to resort to the low @-@ class and shameless means of conspiracies , schemes and rumors , because they have confidence in themselves .
Truth is on their side , and their future is bright .
Therefore , their actions are open and above @-@ board , frank and solemn .
On the other hand , to protect their selfish interests , which are contrary to truth and justice , while knowing that their advocations , outlines , political tasks , and political goals are unpopular with the broad people , the political vagrants do not dare to act openly and seriously .
They can only resort to stealth and secrecy ; therefore , they are experts in conspiracies , tricks and rumors .
Creating rumorss or &quot; spreading rational hearsay , &quot; becomes their favorite trick , because , unable to compete with their opponents in open and frank political struggles , they can only depend on creating rumors .
Furthermore , as an ancient classic puts it , &quot; Tseng Ts &apos;an committed murder ; his mother threw down the shuttle of the loom , &quot; or , as a poet wrote , &quot; three men together become tigers in the marketplace ; saturation turns into glue and varnish . &quot; It can be very effective .
Moreover , rumors also have another function : to serve as a blinder or smokescreen .
Wasn &apos;t there such a story ?
When a thief was discovered in the act and an alarm was raised , the thief ingeniously joined in the outcry : &quot; The thief is over there ! &quot; He was thus able to get away .
When
doing something against their own conscience , the decadent political figures often resort to rumormongering to shift the attention and hide themselves .
The most recent example of this was the extensive and systematic spreading of the rumor that &quot; the 18th Group Army concentrates in north Shansi and does not coordinate with the friendly troops in combat . &quot; The first to spread this rumor was a skilled veteran in this fieldthe T &apos;UNG @-@ MENG PRESS .
Early this month , while mounting a minor military operation , the Japanese bandits launched a major attack by rumors .
The TTUNG @-@ MENG PRESS spread all kinds of rumors , article after article , stressing in particular the refusal of the 8th Route Army to cooperate with the Central troops , its concentration in northern Shensi in preparation for action against Sian , its utilization of the opportunity to expand and capture the weapons of the Central troops , etc .
The goal of the Japanese bandits in launching military attacks and attacks by rumor is very clear .
It can be described in one word : Intimidationl Or , to force a surrender by intimidation !
Military attack is to show off their military might , as if to say : If you do not surrender , we will occupy your homeland and all your seaports , wipe out tens of thousands of your troops in Chung @-@ t &apos;iao @-@ shan , and take Loyang , Sian , Kunming , and Chungking .
What are you going to do about it ?
Attack by rumor is to alienate the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party .
They paint a gloomy picture and intimidate you by saying : See how bad the relationship is between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party .
Self @-@ revitalization , but what hope is there ?
Better surrender immediately !
Such rumors as &quot; the 8th Route Army will not fight Japan &quot; are the smokescreen , while forcing a surrender by intimidation and inducement is the goal .
The technique is most superficial ; the reason is most clear .
What is strange is that certain Chinesenot traitors like Wang Ching @-@ wei , but certain figures of the ruling stratum in the resistance war strongholdactually copy T &apos;UNG @-@ MENG PRESS1 broadcast word for word and voluntarily rebroadcast the rumors .
While actually stating that &quot; information from the enemy is mostly fabricated and cannot be believed , &quot; such news organs as TA KUWG PAO and the CENTRAL PRESS AGENCY repeat the &quot; information from the enemy &quot; and claim that &quot; that the 18th Group Army has been concentrating in northern Shansi and until now has not cooperated with the friendly troops in battle is a fact . &quot; The Japanese do not have to spend a penny , and there are those Chinese who volunteer to serve as phonographs and witnesses to their rumors .
Isn &apos;t it strange ?
Nevertheless , actually there is nothing &quot; strange &quot; about it .
If we understand the ingenuity of the thief in the story cited above , we will understand the &quot; secret &quot; of the rumors .
The spokesman of the Chungking Military Commission more or less leaked a part of this &quot; secret &quot; on the 23d of this month .
He said : &quot; Last week there was a general mobilization of the bandit army , totaling over 300,000 men .
When they brag about solving the &apos; China incident1 by such means , not only will no one
in the world believe them , but even the enemy bandits themselves know it is impossible . &quot; Did it not imply that such means ( military attack ) would not solve the problem ; better use another method !
As was expected , T &apos;UNG @-@ MENG PRESS immediately reported that military authorities on all fronts claimed that the initial fighting had concluded .
Thus , the rumors echoed back and forth , creating an intermediary effect like writing verses on a red leaf .
What was regrettable was that some of the Political Council members in Hong Kong were actually deceived by this little sleight of hand .
We feel that there is no need for us to &quot; quell the rumors &quot; again , because the perseverance of the 8th Route Army and the Communist Party members in the resistance war and their loyalty to the nation are facts which cannot be shaken by rumors ; they are true gold , fearing no fire .
Though the New 4th Army has been declared a rebel army and the 8th Route Army has not received one bullet in 2 years or a halfpenny &apos;s worth of rations in 5 months , the officers and soldiers of the two armies have never for one minute stopped fighting the enemy .
Meanwhile , to relieve the battle pressure in southern Shansi , the 8th Route Array is waging bloody battles on the entire front in North China .
These are the facts well known to those creating rumors and those spreading them .
That they create and spread rumors is for another purpose .
What is the purpose ?
Those creating rumors wish to induce surrender ; those spreading them wish to surrender .
They all want to use the Communist Party as the excuse , and the Communist Party serves as the red leaf on which they write their verses .
During the height of their spring fever , the Japanese compose a poem on a red leaf and float it up the Yangtze River .
Picking up the red leaf , those at this end feel excited .
They write an answering poem and float it down the river .
This was the reason that the T &apos;UNG @-@ MENG PRESS and CENTRAL PRESS AGENCY have chanted and responded on the Communist Party issue in recent days .
There are also Germany &apos;s ZEITUNG PRESSE , America &apos;s UNITED PRESS , and England &apos;s REUTER which , for their own different purposes , have spread the love poems of both sides everywhere .
Their common goal is to &quot; hurry the marriage , &quot; except that England and America do so for the purpose of resisting the communists , the Soviet Union and Germany , and Germany has in mind the purpose of opposing England and America .
That is the only difference .
&quot; You had better get married quickly , so that the Pacific war can be launched &quot; this is the goal of Germany .
&quot; You had better get married quickly , so that an anticommunist , , anti @-@ Soviet Union , and anti ~ Germany Far Eastern Munich can be created &quot; this is the goal of England and America .
We cannot but advise the leaders of the Chinese Kuomintang that such a marriage is a &quot; shotgun marriage , &quot; which will not bring happiness in the future ; it is better to refuse the proposal .
Using the Communist Party as an excuse will not get you anywhere , either .
If you don &apos;t believe us , just wait and see !
Our countrymen throughout China , pay attention to the crisis of surrender concealed under the smokescreen of rumors !
The grave danger of a Far Eastern Munich is growing daily .
The &quot; military attack &quot; this time , with the goal of &quot; intimidating Chiang to surrender , &quot; has temporarily passed .
What follows will inevitably be surrender by inducement .
Though it is an old trick of the Japanese to &quot; hit , then drag ; hit and drag , &quot; it contains a new significance , because it is precisely from May to October 1941 &#91; ? &#93; .
Our countrymen of the entire nation must rise and expose and smash it .
It is a momentous task linked with the life of the nation !

YENAN COMMENTATOR ON THE DOUBLE MEANING OF &apos; FIRESIDE TALKS &apos; 30 May 1941
&#91; Text &#93; Concerning U.S.
President Roosevelt &apos;s fireside chat published on the 27th , a Yenan commentator stated :
This chat had a double meaningforcing Germany to compromise and preparing to enter the war .
Currently , the imperialist war has developed to a crucial point in history .
Every imperialist nation is confronted with this issue : either a long @-@ term war , which may result in the destruction of capitalism and the outbreak of a world revolution ; or an imperialist peace , in which case the current war may be converted to a war against the Soviet Union .
With the defection of Hess and the failure of the anti @-@ Soviet faction inside Germany , the anti @-@ Soviet conspiracy of British and American imperialism suffered a great setback .
Nevertheless , the conspiracy is not finished .
The goal of England and America is still to utilize their naval superiority , regain command of the air , and force Hitler &apos;s fire to spread eastward .
They know that Hitler fears only America ; therefore , in his chat this time Roosevelt demonstrated an extraordinary attitude in threatening him .
When he said that &quot; we cannot tolerate Hitler &apos;s control of the world or the world of the 2000 &quot; s , &quot; he indicated that , as long as Hitler did not attack England or seek naval superiority , he would be permitted to control Europe and be relieved of the burden of the Versailles Treaty , so that there would be an Imperialist peace , in order to attack the Soviet Union ; otherwise , war would be declared on Germany , It was to force Germany to compromise .
However , Hitler fears not only America but the Soviet Union even more .
After the defection of Hess , Germany and the Soviet Union have reached a new understanding .
The Mediterranean war is unusually fierce , and England may be invaded .
Churchill &apos;s SOS cables are probably raining down like snowflakes .
The U.S.
rulers have no choice but to make plans to enter the war in case the effort to force Germany to compromise fails .
Therefore , Roosevelt &apos;s chat has the effect of preparing to enter the war .
His words also imply the conspiracy of a Far Eastern Munich .
According to the T &apos;UNG @-@ MENG PRESS , Roosevelt in his chat stated that the relationship between Japan and America &quot; has not
been studied . &quot; He also said ; &quot; That the scope of the chat is unusually narrow is for the purpose of concentrating on Germany . &quot; These words show that he is leaving room for Japan , but they actually imply a great conspiracy to sacrifice China for a compromise between Japan and America .
They deserve our attention .
In his statement of the 28th , China &apos;s Foreign Minister Wang repeatedly expressed &quot; gratitude &quot; to Roosevelt , without indicating the least bit of alarm .
It is truly unsound .
Before we have final proof that America has abandoned the conspiracy of a Far Eastern Munich , our task is to be vigilant against betrayal .
As for &quot; gratitude , &quot; there is really no hurry .

YENAN COMMENTATOR &apos;S COMMENTS 2 June 1941
&#91; Text &#93; A Yenan commentator commented on the letters exchanged between Hull and Kuo T &apos;ai @-@ ch &apos;i on America &apos;s willingness to relinquish its extraterritoriality in China after peace is resumed between China and Japan :
This is an interesting interlude in the midst of fermenting a Tar Eastern Munich .
The purpose is to obscure the understanding of the Chinese people and their vigilance against the realistic danger of betrayal with a blank check of a remote future .
Nevertheless , while the trick may win the gratitude and allegiance of certain Chinese who worship the dollar and revere material things , it will only aggravate the feeling of repugnance of the broad masses of China .
They will tell Uncle Sam : Instead of such blank checks of a remote future , it is better for you to immediately stop sending petroleum , iron and steel , and other weapons to Japan , and not to serve as an accomplice of the Japanese bandits in their slaughter of the Chinese .

WHAT THE KUOMINTAKG LACKS 17 June 1941
&#91; Text &#93; What does the Kuomintang lack ?
Airplanes and artillery ?
Cadre talents ?
The method to resist Japan ?
True , none of these things is in ample supply .
But what it lacks most is the confidence of the nation .
Certain gentlemen of the Kuomintang often revile others ( especially the Communist Party ) for lacking the concept of the state and the nation .
However , since the Communist Party and the people have never been negative toward the resistance war and national liberation , no matter how novel the theories of these gentlemen or how extensive their articless one will only find the waste of paper alarming and incompatible with the thrift movement advocated by Mr Chiang Kai @-@ shek .
But just how much reserve is left in the treasury of their own concept of the state and the nation is doubtful .
We will not gloat over the misfortunes of others .
We can only solemnly advise those gentlemen : Please take care of yourselves , .and add more weight to it !
It will be beneficial to you and to us , and to the state and the nation most beloved by you and us .
Please think it over calmly .
How far have you gone in flattering and depending on America ?
We do not ask you to give up your illusions about America , because it involves the freedoms of thought and speech .
But Confucius said : Let the words be adequate to express the idea ; excess is the same as inadequacy .
You arbitrarily claim that China and England are the left and right wings of America and that the Han River and the English Channel are both its frontiers .
What &apos;s the need of that ?
You also claim that America and China have transcended the relationship of allies .
We wish to inquire what obligation as an ally , since the beginning of history , has America ever performed for China ?
Yet , the relationship of allies has been transcended !
What kind of intimate relationship is it ?
Just because little Captain Roosevelt came to China and acquired a few sworn brothers , do you flatter them to the skies ?
But the curve on the graph representing the military supply trade between America and Japan is shooting up into the clouds .
You take Hull &apos;s sheet of empty words as a Buddhist charm , while they are
discussing with Nomura the matter of ordering China to stop the war .
It seems that China has , at whatever time , entered America &apos;s pocketbook altogether !
This is truly transcending the relationship of allies , and the Han River can truly be considered the Mississippi .
Is it impossible not to rely on America ?
At least , do not rely on the America of Mars !
No matter how Pao Hsu and others weep their hearts out and stand at the gate of the U.S.
State Department for weeks on end , the America on Earth can only move its Pacific fleet to the Atlantic at present .
Yet youyou once placed all your hopes on a war between Japan and the Soviet Union .
Now you place your hopes on a war between Japan and America .
You don &apos;t care that , from the high heavens to the depth of the earth , no trace of a war between Japan and America is found on today &apos;s daily agenda .
We wish to ask you : If , unfortunately , America &apos;s compromise should become a fact , how would you conclude your comedy ?
When the people blame you for practicing a planned deception in your action today , how can you deny it ?
Even if the compromise between Japan and America does not succeed , what royal favors has America granted us to make our noble and struggling great nation so degraded , to make us lose our national and personal integrity to such an extent ?
Just how much national concept is in all your propaganda ?
On which page and which chapter of Mr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s nationalism are they based ?
Under what dictionary definition of Mr Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s slogan of self @-@ revitalization ?
Please think it over again calmly .
How far have you gone in your destruction and suppression , your rumormongering and false accusations against the Communist Party and the people ?
To handle the Communist Party and the people , what a gigantic structure you have built !
This structure is growing bigger and bigger , like the pitiful Arab and the camel in the fable , squeezing all other functions of the resistance @-@ war government out of the tent .
Whether in ancient times or today , whether here or abroad , adopting such a policy when the powerful enemy is pressing in on us is not prospering or building the nation ; it can only damage and destroy the nation .
How can you not understand this simple truth ?
Yet , since you regard strangers as compatriots and dream of building your national center in the New York Stock Exchange , naturally you consider your compatriots as strangers , and naturally you fail to see the unlimited power and unlimited future of the nation in the people .
Moreover , &quot; one foot of cloth can still be sewn ; one peck of rice can still be hulled ; two brothers cannot tolerate each other . &quot; You wish to treat your own countrymen as sworn enemies !
How brave you were in the southern Anhwei incident and the many kinds of anticommunist activities !
How creative and positive when you fabricate rumors and manufacture all kinds of anticommunist public opinion !
Since you do not hesitate to brand the people and the people &apos;s vanguard as bandits and rebels , how can you have any confidence in the nation ?
Though we suffer all kinds of intolerable hostility on your part , as long as you continue the resistance war the Communist Party and the people will cherish you
and remain cooperative .
Unfortunately , you seem to lack even this kind of confidence .
Since you do not trust others , or even yourselves , just how much national concept do you have ?
On which page and which chapter of Mr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s nationalism are they based ?
Under what dictionary definition of Mr Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s slogan of self @-@ revitalization ?
&quot; This faithless and perverse world ?
Verily I say unto you : If you have faith like a mustard seed , in regard to this mountain , if you wish to move it from here to there , it will be moved , and there is nothing which you cannot do . &quot; Today , when the national confidence is so cruelly trampled upon , we cannot but borrow the words of Jesus to present to the Kuomintang .
Many in the Kuomintang have been very pessimistic recently , and they even know that relying on America is not the way out .
They wonder why the Communist Party gains greater victories under more difficult conditions .
No matter how unfavorable the domestic and international environment , the Communist Party remains impregnable and steady and progresses .
What secret does it have ?
Its entire secret is its faith in the nation and the people of China ; therefore , it always struggles alongside the great masses of the entire nation and does not rely on foreign countries , especially the imperialists .
Nevertheless , for what reason is the Kuomintang unable to raise its national confidence , unable to trust the people and itself , but has to worship the scheming imperialist conspirators ?
Many &quot; theorists &quot; of the Kuomintang say that , among the three principles of democracy , nationalism is the most needed at present .
This probably is the so @-@ called ideology .
For what reason is the Kuomintang unable to adhere to this one ideology with its entire effort ?
As long as the Kuomintang can firmly raise its national confidence and firmly wage the national independence war , all its difficulties can be solved , and its future will remain bright .

.73DECLARATION OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE IN COMMEMORATION OF THE FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WAR OF RESISTANCE
7 July 1941
&#91; Text &#93; Countrymen and resistance war officers and soldiers of the entire nation !
The sacred war of our great nation of China to resist the Japanese bandits and defend the nation has been fought for exactly 4 years .
The arrival of the 5th year of the resistance war coincides with the serious changes in the international situation .
Hitler , Germany &apos;s insane fascist leader , has -launched a gigantic attack on the Soviet Union , and the Soviet government is leading its 200 million people and several @-@ million @-@ men Red Army in a great war to smash the fascist aggression .
-
Countrymen , officers and soldiers !
The nature of the antifascist war of the Soviet Union is identical with that of our resistance war .
Both are just wars to defend independence , safeguard freedom , and resist aggression .
Meanwhile , like the Japanese fascists who are attacking China , the German fascists are aggressive , enslaving , and unjust .
Therefore , China and the Soviet Union stand on the same front , sharing the successes and failures , the fortunes and misfortunes .
Since the outbreak of the Soviet @-@ German war , sympathy for the Soviet Union has rapidly spread to the entire world , and the people of China feel an even greater concern .
Primarily , the Soviet Union is a socialist state supporting the opppressed nations .
In our 4 years of resistance war , the one &#91; nation &#93; which has helped us most is the Soviet Union .
Next , the war between the Soviet Union and Germany directly affects ChinaTs resistance war .
If Hitler succeeds in the Soviet Union , China will face a serious crisis .
Therefore , all the people of China know that the war waged by the people of the Soviet Union is in defense not only of the Soviet Union but also of China and the freedom and independence of all nations .
The success or failure of the Soviet Union is that of China , as well as of democracy and freedom , independence and liberty , universal principles and justice , and science and light .
Thus , Hitler is the enemy not only of the Soviet Union but also of all free nations , especially China .
For this reason ,
overthrowing Hitler is the task of the people of China as well as the people of the United States and all nations .
Without doubt , fascist Hitler &apos;s insane aggression will only hasten his destruction , as the enemies of fascism vise up throughout the world .
A powerful antifascist aggression front is forming throughout the world .
This is an era of great struggle between the fascist and antifascist fronts throughout the world , and the battle between the two has been joined .
In order to court Japan , consolidate the fascist alliance , and resist China , the Soviet Union , England and America , the fascist countries of Europe openly recognize China &apos;s renegade Wang Ching @-@ wei .
The devil &apos;s claws of Hitler and Mussolini are stretching toward the Pacific .
That fascism is the public enemy of China &apos;s 450 million people and all mankind has been completely revealed .
Meanwhile , trapped in China &apos;s quagmire , fascist Japan competes with England and America in the south .
Its economy is deteriorating , and its people are dissatisfied .
If it should tear up its neutrality pact with the Soviet Union and make the great Soviet Union an enemy , the day of its destruction and collapse will become more imminent .
However , the more urgent the situation , the harder it is to block its reckless determination to carry out its plans .
While the dangers of .
war with the Soviet Union have increased , it will never abandon its policy to destroy China , and its ambition to march south against England , America , the Netherlands and Australia still exists .
The threat of the fascist alliance in the world increases simultaneously in the west and the east .
Only a firm struggle built on the foundation of an antifascist international united front will check the conflagration and stem the tide .
All ideas of gloating over the misfortunes of others and hoping for a windfall are manifestations of superficiality and ignorance .
As for repeating the mistakes of Chang Po @-@ lun or following in the footsteps of Wang Ching @-@ wei , the so @-@ called appeasement policy and surrender line are the most stupid and inferior measures and should never be considered by China and the democratic nations of Europe and America , the Chinese people will always firmly oppose a Far Eastern Munich .
The sacred resistance war of the great nation of China is not only for the purpose of averting China &apos;s perdition but is also helpful to the international resistance against aggression .
In the past 4 years the soldiers and civilians of the entire country have been exerting themselves in the resistance war , disregarding the sacrifices and difficulties , filling the front ranks of the fallen , rallying over and over again , and paying a tremendous price .
After many difficulties they have been able to deter the enemy bandits , win the admiration of the world , lay the foundation for national recovery , and create the embryo of a new China .
These are all the results of our unity above and below , the joint military @-@ civilian effort , the cooperation of the parties and factions , and the aid of friendly nations , worthy of our joyful celebration and special notice .
Nevertheless , enemy aggression is just beginning , not ending , and those plotting against us include the vicious fascist alliance , Nanking &apos;s puppet regime serving as the tiger &apos;s claw , and the pro @-@ Japanese elements inside .
Politics has not stabilized , the people &apos;s living conditions have deteriorated ,
and public opinion has not been expressed .
All kinds of alarming dark shadows have the tendency of becoming more aggravated .
What is even more strange is that anticommunism has become a policy , and the term &quot; alien party &quot; has appeared in writing .
Military discipline and military orders are borrowed as excuses to hit the most positive of the resistance war troops .
Thus , the southern Anhwei incident occurred , and the New 4th Army was disbanded .
Secret service agents act outrageously , and illegal arrests are innumerable .
As a result , the morale of the resistance war has been destroyed and the new spirit of the early period of the war demolished .
In regard to all such dark sides , if they are not eliminated , the achievement of the resistance war of 4 years may be abandoned , the soldiers and civilians of the whole nation may feel lost , and international sympathy will have no substance to which to attach itself .
These are what should cause our countrymen deep concern and alarm .
The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party feels that now , at the beginning of the 5th year of the resistance war , when changes are occurring in the international situation , is an excellent opportunity for us to discard the old and arrange the new .
The people of the entire nation must perform many important fighting tasks .
From foreign affairs to internal administration , there must be new reforms and innovations @-@ before we can adapt to the current situation , refresh the senses of our countrymen , and attain the goal of the resistance war and national construction .
This party respectfully proposes the following :
( 1 ) Support the international antifascist front ; promote the unity of China , the Soviet Union , England , America , and all other antifascist states and nations ; resist the fascist alliance of Germany , Italy , and Japan ; support the correct action of the National Government to sever relations with Germany and Italy and to prepare new steps .
( 2 ) Reinforce the struggle against the puppet regime of renegade Wang ; purge his remnants ; consolidate the anti @-@ Japanese camp .
( 3 ) Intensify the reorganizing and training of all National troops ; strengthen frontline coordination of all units ; supply the troops behind enemy lines with provisions and ammunition ; actively counterattack the enemy .
( 4 ) Strengthen the political , economic , and cultural establishments of all resist @-@ Japan bases with government aid , so that such bases will persevere in the enemy rear , making it impossible for the enemy to move its troops west , north , or south .
( 5 ) Strengthen the cooperation among the anti @-@ Japanese parties and factions ; readjust the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party ; solve the New 4th Army issue ; recognize the legitimate activities of all anti @-@ Japanese parties and factions ; stop arresting Communist Party members and all patriotic elements ; eliminate internal frictions ; cultivate the resistance war strength .
( 6 ) Grant freedom of speech , publication , assembly and association to all patriotic people ; activate the wisdom and strength of the people ; resist the enemy bandits .
( 7 ) Reform the political structure ; dismiss the corrupt and the greedy ; promote the enlightened people ; purge the concealed pro @-@ Japanese elements in government organs and eliminate the enemy &apos;s fifth column .
( 8 ) .Prohibit corrupt and greedy officials from hoarding , speculating , and manipulating the national economy ; enforce grain balancing and price stabilization in order to give the people relief .
( 9 ) Reform the conscription system ; prohibit blackmail , bribery , coercion , and abuse ; replace it with political mobilization to encourage the people to go to the frontline in order to benefit the resistance war .
( 10 ) Readjust the relationship between the central and the local governments ; rely on local talents and rally the minorities in order to consolidate the rear .
This party feels that the above points constitute the basic policy for today &apos;s internal affairs and foreign diplomacy .
If they are implemented , there will be a brand @-@ new atmosphere in the entire nation , all difficulties will be surmounted3 and there will be a firm foundation for the victory of the resistance war and national construction .
The Chinese Communist Party wishes to reiterate : This party &apos;s adherence to the policy of the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front never varies ; it wishes to unite with the Chinese Kuomintang , all patriotic parties and factions , and all patriotic people to the final end and to struggle for the common goal of the resistance war and national construction .
In regard to the three principles of democracy and the national reconstruction outline , this party is the most sincere and firmest follower .
It will carry out the declaration of 22 September 1937 , without the slightest hesitation .
The 8th Route and New 4th armies are always a part of the National Army , performing the resistance war tasks most loyally and courageously , resisting and counterattacking more than half of the enemy forces , recovering large areas of lost territory , and building many resistance bases in the enemy rear .
In these resistance bases we have gradually introduced the three principles of democracy .
We have implemented the three @-@ thirds system of a democratic government under which the parties and factions and the classes and strata cooperate and the human , political , and property rights of all anti @-@ Japanese classes and strata ( including the landlords and capitalists ) are guaranteed ; we have implemented the rural policy , reducing , rents and interest on the one hand and enforcing rent and interest payments on the other ; we have implemented the labor policy , improving the workers &apos; life on the one hand and strengthening labor discipline on the other ; we have implemented the economic policy , developing agriculture , industry , and commerce and improving the people &apos;s living conditions ; we
have Implemented the culture policy , wiping out illiteracy and ignorance and improving the national spirit .
All these serve as proof that the Chinese Communist Party is the vanguard in defending the nation , a revolutionary political party whose words and deeds are one , the model of unity in the resistance war , and the example of arduous struggle .
Meanwhile , the enemy , renegade Wang , and the pro @-@ Japanese faction concentrate their aims on this party , wishing to destroy and eliminate it , because they know that its existence constitutes the greatest obstacle to their plan to destroy China .
If the Communist Party is not eliminated , it will be impossible to destroy China .
What is strange is that some of those in the country who are still fighting the resistance war feel the same way as the enemy in their intent to slander , betray , and destroy this party , calling it a bandit army and a cabal and devoting their full effort to its destruction and suppression .
In the face of a powerful enemy , why are they so anxious to destroy their own countrymen ?
Truly it is beyond understanding !
We hope that such phenomena will be rapidly eliminated and the condition of the early period of the resistance war resumed , turning hostility into harmony , changing mutual friction into mutual aid , and all concentrating on the state and the nation .
Then the future of the resistance war will become bright , and the 5th year of the war will bring unity , progress , and victory .
This is what this party prays for .
Countrymen , officers and soldiers !
The 5th year of the resistance war is the decisive year of the destiny of the world as well as that of China .
Everyone must become aware , unite and strive with an extraordinary effort , adhere to the banner of China &apos;s national liberation , stand on firm ground and struggle forward , and , in coordination with the antifascist struggles of the people of the various nations , seek our complete victory .
The Chinese Communist Party fully believes that , as long as we persevere in our effort and make no mistakes , our goal can be attained , and the final victory will belong to us .
Down with.Japanese imperialism !
Down with the fascist slaves !
Aid the Soviet Union !
Long live the victory of the resistance war !
Long live the antifascist front of the whole world !

REFUTING HO YING @-@ CH &apos;IN 9 July 1941
&#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY , Yenan , 9 JulyIn his article on the 4th year of the resistance war puhlished by the CENTRAL PRESS AGENCY , Ho Ying @-@ ch &apos;in still claimed &apos; : &quot; The New 4th Army disobeyed orders , refused to move and intended to sabotage the resistance war situation and destroy the anti @-@ Japanese front ; it was therefore ordered to be disbanded . &quot; The spokesman of the Revolutionary Military Affairs Commission of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee stated :
Ho Ying @-@ ch &apos;in , the hidden leader of the pro @-@ Japanese faction , was the ringleader in the incident of disbanding the New 4th Army and the one whom the Chinese Communist Party Central once requested the National Government to punish .
The whole world knows that the New 4th Army consisted of loyal and courageous troops in the resistance war before the southern Anhwei incident and that its 100,000 men continued to fight the enemy north and south of the Yangtze after the soutern Anhwei incident- After the southern Anhwei incident occurred was precisely because army commander Yeh Tring and deputy commander Hsiang Ying followed orders to move north and encountered an ambush in the Mao @-@ lin .
area .
Therefore , the action of 13 January to wipe out the southern Anhwei troops of the New 4th Army and the order of the Military Commission of 17 January to disband the said army were both reactionary and counterrevolutionary measures confounding the right and wrong and contrary to the interest of the resistance war .
They will not escape the censure of public opinion in generations to come .
A folk ballad of southern Anhwei states : &quot; Military discipline , military disciplineeliminate the dissenters ; orders , ordersJapan is pleased . &quot; It truly hits the nail on the head .
At the beginning of the 5th year of the resistance war , all soldiers and civilians in the nation demand a stronger national unity , and Committee Chairman Chiang also declared the necessity of &quot; loyal and sincere unity . &quot; Treacherous and shameless , Ho Ying @-@ ch &apos;in had the audacity to utter such defamations , which are detrimental to unity and beneficial to the .Japanese bandits .
He is truly as heartless as Ch &apos;en Shu @-@ pao !
When it comes to &quot; sabotaging the resistance war situation and destroying the anti @-@ Japanese front , &quot; the whole country knows that it is none other than the pro @-@ Japanese Ho Ying @-@ ch &apos;in .
With Ch &apos;in Kuai in power , Yueh Fei had
to die .
With Ho Ying @-@ ch &apos;in inside the resist @-@ Japan front , the loyal and courageous New 4th Army had to be disbanded .
If he continues to usurp an important position , the resistance war situation and the resist @-@ Japan front will be destroyed .
Therefore , we eagerly hope that the National Government will take the resistance war standpoint , dismiss Ho Ying @-@ ch &apos;in , and promptly solve the New 4th Army issue in order to promote unity and the resistance war .
We hope and pray for it .

RESOLUTION OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATION AND STUDY
1 August 1941
&#91; Text &#93; ( 1 ) Though our party &apos;s study of the history and society of China and the international situation in the past 20 years has been advancing gradually , increasing our knowledge , it is still extremely inadequate .
We get the rough outlines without seeking thorough understanding , and we consider ourselves correct .
Subjectivism and formalism still exist to a serious extent in the party .
Since the resistance war our party has made great progress in understanding Japan , domestic economic and political relations and social conditions , and subjectivism and formalism have diminished .
But what we understand is still roughhewn and sketchy , without systematic and detailed comprehension .
Subjectivism and formalism have not completely disappeared .
The gravity of the damage to revolutionary work in the past 20 years resulting from subjectivism and formalism in the thinking and method of a number of comrades and the lack of ample knowledge in all aspects has not been fully realized by the leading organs of the party and all the comrades .
In regard to the internal and external environment of their own work area , whether in the aspect of social , economic and political relations , or of the enemy and the counterfeit government , or of work , some responsible local comrades are lacking in a systematic and detailed understanding .
Many comrades in the party do not understand the principle that there is no right to speak without investigation , or the fact that systematic and detailed social investigation constitutes the foundation for determining policies .
They still do not know that the fundamental task of a leading organ , is to understand conditions and master the policies and that , if the conditions are not understood , the policies inevitably will be wrong .
They still do not know how detailed are Japanese imperialism &apos;s investigation and study of China .
They still do not know that the subjec @-@ tivist work style of rough outlining and regarding oneself as right is the first manifestation of impure party essence , while seeking the truth through the facts and close linking of theory and reality constitute the minimum attitude of a party member with a strong party essence .
Ours is now a large political party with a great revolutionary mission .
Its every word and every act affect the future of the state and society .
We must vigorously prevent emptiness and superficiality , wipe out the subjectivist work style ,
and adopt concrete methods .
From the Central to each and every party member , we must reinforce our investigation and study of history , of the environment , and of the concrete conditions inside and outside the country , the province , the county , and the district before we can effectively rally the revolutionary strength of all classes in the nation and overthrow the control of Japanese imperialism .
( 2 ) In regard to the method of investigation and study , the following are examples : First , collect all kinds of newspapers , publications , and books on politics , military affairs , economics , culture , and social class relations issued by our enemies , our friends , and ourselves for extracting , editing , and studying .
Second , invite experienced persons to hold investigation meetings of three to eight persons and study typical instances of the issues of a township , ward , county , city , town , army , division , plant , store , or school ( such as the land , labor , vagrant , and guild issues ) .
To start from typical instances is the most concrete method , proceeding from one typical instance to another .
Third , in the rural village stress the detailed investigation of the living conditions , political needs , and mutual relations of the landlords , rich peasants , merchants , middle peasants , poor peasants , hired help , handicraft workers , and vagrants ; in the city stress those of the compradore and large bourgeois class , national bourgeoisie , petty bourgeoisie , proletariat , the masses of poor people , and vagrant masses .
Fourth , collect material by utilizing all types of cadres and delegates meetings .
Fifth , write biographies of famous figures .
Assessing the tremendous influence of the leading &apos; figures in China &apos;s society , studying the different aspects of such figures , and compiling the information into biographies constitute an important link in the study of all of China .
Inside the anti @-@ Japanese front , biographies of several hundred to several thousand words should be written on capitalists and landowners with assets of 50,000 yuan or more , officers of the rank of regimental commander and above , officials of the rank of county magistrate and above , responsible persons of all the parties and factions at the county level and above , famous scholars , cultured persons , journalists , religionists , and social activists well known inside and outside the county , and foreign activists living in China in order to clarify their background and interests and decide on the appropriate steps to cooperate with them against Japan .
In regard to the leaders of guilds scorned by society , head tramps , bandit chiefs , and famous performers and courtesans , if they have any good point worthy of recording , we should also clarify them so that they will contribute to the national liberation cause .
In regard to the important enemy bandits and traitors and the important elements serving as their henchmen , as they are the objectives of our current struggle there is an even greater need to understand them fully in order to attain the goal of knowing oneself and the others and winning all battles .
The writing of the biographies should be assigned to the comrades of the district and county committees .
The contents of the biographies must be factual , without any distortion due to personal bias or prejudice .
Sixth , interview individuals verbally , either sending someone to do so or asking the interviewees to appear , including the cadres , workers , peasants , cultured persons , sympathizers , merchants , officials , tramps , and captives .
Seventh , collect and study county , prefectural , and provincial records , family records , and maps .
( 3 ) In regard to the working cadres and students of the cadre training schools , we must conduct education on clarifying the objective conditions ( enemies , friends , and ourselves ) .
We must encourage those comrades who excel in clarifying the objective conditions quantitatively and qualitatively and criticize those who prefer empty discussions divorced from reality .
We must encourage those who understand the conditions and pay attention to policies and criticize those who do not understand the conditions and pay no attention to policies .
In this way the trend of understanding conditions and paying attention to policies will be closely linked with that of learning Marxist @-@ Leninist theories .
In studying we must oppose the trend of disregarding reality and only memorizing the text , as well as the undesirable phenomenon of disconnecting the study of Marxist @-@ Leninist truths and principles from the clarification of China &apos;s social conditions and the solution of the issue of its revolution .
We must encourage the cadres and students to read newspapers and guide them in the method of newspaper reading and in the analysis of every change in the current situation .
We must furnish the cadres and students with practical information on all kinds of conditions inside and outside the country , the province , and the county and make the teaching and studying of such information and forming conclusions into a regular course of study , assigning the necessary time required and giving tests .

STATEMENT OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE OK A RECENT INTERNATIONAL EVENT
19 August 1941
&#91; Text &#93; Concerning the declaration of Roosevelt and Churchill and the Moscow conference to be held soon , the Chinese Communist Central makes the following announcement :
The joint declaration of the U.S.
President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill of 14 August and the proposal for a three @-@ power conference in Moscow constituted a momentous event of a world historical significance , opening a new stage , in world history .
The joint declaration and the proposal for a Moscow conference showed the determination of England and America to smash fascism .
Such determination is completely favorable to the Soviet Union , to England and America , to China , and to the world .
The greatest danger in the past and at present is the profascist reactionary faction inside England and America which attempts to accept a fascist peace contrary to the will of the people , but now the declaration has rejected such a peace .
Or , there are those who advocate watching the fire from across the river and letting the Soviet Union shoulder the burden of wiping out fascism alone , in order to reap the benefit in the future , but the proposal to hold a Moscow conference for the concrete distribution of war tasks and war resources is a blow to such a negative endeavor .
As long as England and America admit &quot; the necessity of disarming the aggressor nations , &quot; advocate &quot; the final collapse of Nazism , &quot; and agree to share the war tasks and war resources , the victory of the Soviet Union , England , and America and of China and the whole world is assured .
The fact that the Soviet Union observed the treaty while Germany tore it up and attacked the Soviet Union , mentioned in Stalin &apos;s famous speech of 3 July , constituted a long @-@ term political factor , and this factor is actually the foundation of military victory .
This truth has been completely proven in the Roosevelt @-@ Churchill joint declaration and the proposal for a Moscow conference .
The joint declaration and the proposal for a Moscow conference demonstrated especially the determination of America to participate in the sacred war against fascist aggression , and it shows that the great fighting front against fascist aggression in the whole world has been completed politically .
The Moscow conference will complete it organizationally .
The fascist aggression
front is already in a state of isolation , and the failure of fascism is already decided .
Such a situation was impossible before the outbreak of the European war in the fall of 1939 , although at that time the Soviet Union and the people of the whole world vigorously advocated an antifascist front to safeguard international security , the Munich policy , detrimental to themselves as well as others , still existed in England and America .
Only after the cruel lessons of war was this erroneous policy changed .
In regard to the direct factor , it was the result of the courageous struggle of the Soviet people .
The Red Army halted the German offensive and gave Roosevelt and Churchill the courage to hold the meeting and publish the declaration .
It was also the result of the courageous struggles of the people of England and America .
Such struggles hit the profascist reactionaries inside their own countries and gave Roosevelt -and Churchill the strength to refuse the temptation of a fascist peace , publish the declaration for human justice , and decide on a firm alliance of England , America , and the Soviet Union , the three great powers , which is a policy with political foresight .
It was also the result of the courageous struggles of .
the people of China .
China stopped the attack of Japan &apos;s fascist bandit army and supplied England and America with the courage to declare the disarming of all aggressor nations .
Japan was not mentioned in the declaration .
Article 4 of the declaration hinted at the possibility of trade with and supply of raw materials to Japan , and Article 7 implied permitting Japanese immigration .
It shows that they were still trying to court Japan &apos;s status quo faction , demonstrating their willingness to compromise .
Article 2 of the declaration opposed territorial changes by force , Article 3 advocated the restitution of rights to those countries deprived of them , and Article 8 , especially , admitted the necessity of disarming all aggressor nations .
All of these points are actively anti @-@ Japanese .
In sum , the people of China welcome the joint declaration of England and America and the three @-@ power conference soon to be held in Moscow .
The Chinese people believe that they are the international foundation for winning liberation from the fascist threat , not only for the people of England , America , and the Soviet Union , but also for the people of the whole world and of China .
! The tasks of the Chinese people are to persevere in unity and the resistance war , overcome the reactionary elements inside the anti @-@ Japanese front which are attempting to destroy unity and the resistance war , and actively organize a counteroffensive against the Japanese bandits .
An enemy fifth column exists inside China , made up of pro @-@ Japanese and pro @-@ German factions .
Contrary to the national interest and the interest of mankind , they advocate anticommunism for the purpose of responding to Hitler &apos;s &quot; anti @-@ Bolshevik crusade &quot; and clearing the way for Japanese fascism .
At this time , when worldwide antifascist unity is being forged , if such a fifth column remains unaware of the situation and continues its criminal activities against the communists , the people , the nation and mankind , it will be abandoned by the entire country and the whole world .
We believe that , as long as the people of the whole nation reinforce their endeavors and purge the fifth column , we will be able to consolidate our unity , persevere in the resistance war , and realize the counteroffensive .
China has the qualifications to participate in the world antifascist front and become an effective force .
The
destiny of all of China and all of mankind is linked with this fight against fascism , and the parties and factions in China must handle skillfully this rare opportunity , rally the people of the entire country , and unanimously strive toward the good and the progressive .
This is what our Communist Party members eagerly hope for .

COMRADE MAO TSE @-@ TUNG ADDRESSES EASTERN ANTIFASCIST MEETING , CALLING ON ALL NATIONS TO STRENGTHEN UNITY
30 October 1941
&#91; Text &#93; The central agenda for the 4th and 5th days of the Antifascist Nationality Conference called for the delegates to continue making reports and analyses for members of their respective nationalities .
The meeting of the 29th consisted of the reports of Vietnamese delegate Hoang Than Quang , Tibetan delegate ( Sang Yueh @-@ hsi ) , Taiwan delegate Ts &apos;ai Ch &apos;ien , Mongolian delegate We Lan @-@ fu , Moslem delegate ( Ma Yen ) , Northeast delegate Yu Ping @-@ jan , and Dutch Indonesian delegate ( A @-@ li @-@ a @-@ han ) .
The 30th was the last day for special reports .
After reading the congratulatory cables from various sources , the Overseas Chinese League delegate first made his report .
He gave a concrete account of the distribution of Overseas Chinese in East Asia , their economic situation , and their great contributions in labor production .
&quot; They took the risk of leaving their father country and courageously wandered to all areas , and they struggle continuously for their own livelihood and the glory of their father country .
Currently , when the fascist wild tide sweeps over the whole world , the Overseas Chinese will form antifascist strongholds in all areas ! &quot; He ended the report by substantiating his conclusion with concrete facts .
Thai delegate ( Ma @-@ na ) was the second person to make a statement : &quot; Thailand is currently under the sword of Japanese aggression .
Japan has now completely discarded the false friendship of the past .
The false friend of the past is the true enemy of today . &quot; When he discussed current conditions in Thailand , he revealed the conspiracies carried out by Japan , such as &quot; corrupting the bureaucrats , provoking the feelings of the government and the people , disrupting relations between the Thais and the Chinese , creating animosity between the Thais and the British and American residents , inducing Thai students to study in Japan , and instigating Thailand to attack Vietnam . &quot; Finally , he enumerated the desires of the Thai people : &quot; Internally , they wish to unite all minorities and all classes to resist Japan , rally the foreign residents in Thailand , especially the Chinese , and build an antifascist front .
Externally , they wish to unite all nations in the East for joint struggles , participate in the world antifascist front , and render aid to the Soviet Union . &quot; There followed the reports of Miao delegate ( Sha @-@ wa @-@ chi @-@ kai ) and Yi delegate ( Mo @-@ han ) .
Old worker Chu Pao @-@ t &apos;ing congratulated &apos; the meeting
During the rest period , Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung braved a fine rain and arrived suddenly .
He was cheered wildly by the entire meeting .
Full of energy and very alert , he strode to the rostrum after a few words with the reporters and addressed the meeting :
&quot; This meeting will be successful .
The reports and discussions today will be very productive .
That the various nationalities can unite , rise , and jointly handle Japanese imperialism is an excellent phenomenon .
I feel that the main goal of the meeting is unity , promoting the unity of the nationalities and smashing fascism together .
That Japan and Hitler can succeed for a time is because they seize upon our weak point .
Our weak point is disunity , which exists in China , in East Asia , and in the whole world . &quot;
After making a profound explanation of the history of the past , he pointed out ;
He then discussed the situation in the future :
&quot; Hereafter there will be bigger battles to fight .
The fascists have great ambitions , still possess the strength , and will launch more insane aggressions .
Hitler lashes out indiscriminately in face of the great unity of England , America , and the Soviet Union .
Naturally , difficulties always exist in war .
Therefore , there will still be a difficult period in the struggles against fascism .
This point must be clearly realized by all .
Now the difficulties are only 50 or 60 percent ; 100 @-@ percent difficulty is still to come .
This meeting is very meaningful .
Meetings are going on in Moscow and the Far East .
Our meeting is also for the purpose of overcoming the difficulties , while the fascists are utilizing them .
In my view , the more areas the fascists occupy , the greater will be the danger they run , just
In conclusion , he informed everyone :
After some 15 minutes , Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung concluded his speech amidst a standing ovation .
Finally , Jewish delegate Miss ( Yeh @-@ hua Sang @-@ po @-@ ko @-@ lan @-@ te ) made a statement .
She said :
&quot; The 20 million Jewish people in the world all recognize Hitler as their sworn enemy .
We wish , by our firm struggles , to eliminate this group of pests to mankind ! &quot;

COMRADE MAO TSE @-@ TUNG DELIVERS A RADIO SPEECH 7 November 1941
&#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY , Yenan , 7 NovemberThe following is the text of Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tungfs radio speech today :
As the Chinese Communist Party has pointed out time and again , mankind &apos;s task throughout the world today is to unite and resist fascism , while that of the Chinese people is to unite and resist Japanese aggression .
Currently , both types of unity must be greatly reinforced .
From the standpoint of mankind , we feel that England and America must do everything to supply the Soviet Union with more planes and tanks , to aid China with more funds and weaponry , and to devote a greater effort to helping the people of all nations trampled by Germany and Italy in their uprisings .
America should declare war on Germany without hesitation .
It is a step which is absolutely impossible to avoid and which should not be avoided .
The greater the delay , the more American ships will be sunk by German bombing .
Meanwhile , America absolutely must not be deceived by Japan &apos;s conspiracies or reach any compromise with it .
America must , together with China and England , check Japanese fascism by force .
Apparently our hopes coincide with those of the majority of the people of England and America .
What is regrettable is that some people who do not understand the general principles exist in the governments and congresses of these two nations , thus blocking the realization of the people &apos;s will .
Therefore , the people of England and America must strive to overcome such epochal obstacles and push the world antifascist struggles to a higher stage .
China &apos;s situation is also at the turning point for further progress .
Though the Japanese fascists are preparing to advance north and south simultaneously , whatever path they choose , it is inevitable that they will march west to destroy China .
After encountering defeat on the Shansi @-@ Chahar @-@ Hopei border and in Ch &apos;ang @-@ sha and Cheng @-@ chou , Japan is preparing to launch a new offensive against China .
The people and troops of the entire nation must defend each and every resist @-@ Japan battlefield and smash the enemy &apos;s conspiracy to attack .
The people of the whole nation must unite even more successfully , support the National Government to persevere in the resistance war , and
prepare all conditions for a counteroffensive in order to promptly oust the Japanese bandits from China .
Our Communist Party members have always appealed for greater unity .
On this eve of the enemy . &apos; s new offensive , improving the relations among all sides in the resistance war stronghold becomes an even more urgent need .
We hope that the Kuomintang authorities will make prompt decisions and adopt all necessary measures toward this goal .
We believe that , as long as the whole nation truly unites , Japan &apos;s attack will be halted , the preparations for a counteroffensive will be achieved , and the goal of ousting the enemy will be realized .

DIRECTIVE OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE ON THE PACIFIC ANTI @-@ JAPANESE FRONT
9 December 1941
&#91; Text &#93; ( 1 ) As stated in the declaration of this party on the Pacific war , the war fought by England , America , and the Pacific nations against Japan is a just and liberating war , and their victory over Japan is the victory of democracy and freedom .
Therefore , the central task of the people of China , all Overseas Chinese , and the South Sea nations is to build and develop an extensive anti @-@ Japanese and antifascist united front of the Pacific nations .
The components of this united front must include the governments , parties and factions , and the people of all classes and strata of all nations resisting Japanese aggression , the antiwar people in Japan , and the people of its colonies , including Korea , Taiwan , and Vietnam .
This united front must be an alliance of the lower level as well as the upper , of the people as well as the governments .
It must be embodied in an anti @-@ Japanese military alliance of China , England , America , and other Pacific nations and built on the close cooperation between the suzerain governments and the native states .
It must improve the political and economic positions of the native states , organize their people , raise their positivity , and launch guerilla warfare in all Japanese @-@ occupied areas .
It will be impossible to defeat the Japanese bandits without these factors .
( 2 ) The Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party have an especially important role in regard to the united front of England and America .
On the one hand , in cooperation with England and America , eliminating the Japanese bandits is an essential prerequisite to the liberation of the nation of China ; on the other hand , domestic unity , improving its political and military affairs , actively hampering and hitting the enemy , and actively preparing a strategic counteroffensive on the part of China are the important conditions for England and America to defeat the Japanese bandits .
For this reason , the Chinese Communist Party must , in all kinds of situations , sincerely and frankly cooperate with the British and the Americans in order to raise the resistance war strength of England and America and improve the resistance war conditions of China .
( 3 ) Overseas Chinese work must be vigorously launched in the South Seas and in England and America .
They policy of Overseas Chinese work must be to unite all Overseas Chinese , including all classes and strata and all parties
and factions among them , so that they will wage an anti @-@ Japanese struggle together , propagandize and support the unity and resistance war of their fatherland , and support and participate in all the anti @-@ Japanese measures and actions of the local governments .
We must rectify the ultraleftist tendency among the Overseas Chinese and some Communist Party members , asking them to cooperate with the local Chinese embassies and consulates and Ruo @-@ mintang units .
However , in regard to the conduct of the pro @-@ Japanese and pro @-@ German elements in sabotaging the unity of the Overseas Chinese and hampering , the work of resisting Japan , we must firmly , but suitably , oppose it
( 4 ) We must vigorously launch guerilla warfare in enemy @-@ occupied areas in South China , Hainan Island , Vietnam , and all enemy @-@ occupied areas in the South Seas , take concerted military actions , wherever possible , with all the resist @-@ Japan friendly armies and nations such as England and America , and win their support in all aspects .
The policies followed by the guerilla must be compatible with the requirements of the anti @-@ Japanese united front .
We must prevent and rectify all types of leftwing tendencies .
( 5 ) In regard to our work in the South Sea areas , we must establish connections with the local communist parties , help them rectify the leftwing tendencies , and extensively launch the work of a united front .

DECISION OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE ON THE YENAN CADRE SCHOOL
( This decision is applicable in all resist @-@ Japan bases )
Passed by the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee Politburo
17 December 1941
&#91; Text &#93; ( 1 ) The basic defects of the Yenan Cadre School are the dislocation of theory and reality and of learning and application , as well as serious subjectivism and dogmatism .
Such defects are mainly manifested as follows : The students are made to learn large quantities of abstract principles of Marxism @-@ Leninism , with no attention , or almost no attention , given to their substance or to their application in China &apos;s concrete environment .
To remedy such defects , we must stress the point that the goal of the study of Marxist @-@ Leninist theories is to give the students the ability to apply theories correctly in solving the practical problems of China &apos;s revolution , not to memorize and recite the principles in the books .
First , we must make the students distinguish the words and the substance of Marxism @-@ Leninism .
Nest , we must make them understand the substance ( not looking at the words and getting the meaning , but knowing the meaning in their minds ) .
Third , we must make them acquire the ability to apply the substance to China &apos;s concrete environment and discard all formal and empty studying .
For this reason , besides correctly teaching the theories of Marxism @-@ Leninism , we must increase their education in China &apos;s history and conditions and party history and policy , so that they will learn both the theoretical and the practical and link the two vividly .
Cadres at the district committee level and above in the party and at the regimental level and above in the army ( after having solved their cultural problems ) must use the history of the Soviet Communist Party as the basic text for learning Marxism @-@ Leninism , paying special attention to the concrete application of the fundamental viewpoints of dialectic materialism and historical materialism ( not large quantities of their abstract principles ) in order to overcome the extremely undesirable defects of subjectivism and dogmatism .
( 2 ) The absence of clear provisions of their.own concrete goals on the part of the various schools is also one of the defects .
Therefore , it is provided that
( a ) The Central Research Institute serves as an advanced research organ to train the party &apos;s theoretical cadres .
( b ) The Central Party School serves as an advanced and intermediate school to train practical work cadres of the party at the district committee level and above and political work cadres of the army at regimental level and above , all possessing certain independent working abilities .
( c ) The Military Academy serves as an advanced and intermediate school to train military work cadres at the regimental level and above , all possessing certain independent work abilities .
( d ) The Yenan University , the Lu Hsun Art School , and the Natural Science Academy serve as schools to train all types of party and nonparty advanced and intermediate political , cultural , scientific , and technical talents .
The curricula , textbooks , and methods of teaching of the above schools must be compatible with their concrete goals .
( 3 . ) For the purpose of strengthening the concrete guidance of the schools and linking the education of such schools with the practical work units of the Central , it is decided that the Central Research Institute is directly subordinated to the Central Propaganda Department , the Central Party School to the Central Party School Management Committee , the Military Academy to the Military Commission Staff Department , and the Yenan University , Lu Hsun Art School , and Natural Science Institute to the Central Cultural Commission , The superior organs in charge of the schools must consider the work of the schools under them an important part of their duties .
The Central Propaganda Department must , together with the particular superior organs in charge , conduct unified planning , inspection , and supervision of the curricula , teachers , textbooks , and funds of the schools .
( 4 ) For the purpose of realizing the concrete goals of the schools and deriving the maximum benefit from the party &apos;s limited energy and financial abilities , the schools must follow the principle of quality rather than quantity when recruiting students .
The schools and their superior organs must reexamine the student components .
All those incompatible with their concrete goals must be assigned work @-@ or transferred .
( 5 ) Improving the quality of teachers is a determining factor for the success of a school .
The education of cadres at the district committee and regimental level and above must be under the personal guidance of the Central Committee members and the responsible comrades of the various organs of the Central .
The existing teachers must be individually re @-@ examined and handled according to the new standards .
The Central Propaganda Department must render practical aid to the specialized teachers of the schools and raise their quality .. Their political and material treatment must be improved .
( 6 ) It will be impossible to learn Marxist @-@ Leninist theories without a relatively high cultural level .
All the old cadres of worker @-@ peasant origin at the county and battalion levels and above whose cultural level is too low but who need to and can learn must first take supplementary culture courses .
Such supplementary courses must not be limited to the number of words to be learned , but must include the ability to read and write , knowledge of history and geography , social political knowledge , and natural sciences .
The criterion for organizing the cultural classes is the cultural level of the students , not their work positions .
( 7 ) The curricula of the schools of a specialized nature ( such as military , political and legal , fiscal and economic , natural science , cultural and art , normal education , and medicine ) must consist mainly of the theoretical and the practical relevant to the specialization .
The ratio of cultural , political , and specialized subjects must be determined according to the conditions of the schools .
Generally speaking , specialization subjects must constitute 50 percent of the curriculum ( 80 percent in schools where supplementary cultural courses are not required ) , cultural subjects 30 percent , and political subjects 20 percent .
The abnormal situation of overemphasizing political subjects at the expense of all others must be firmly rectified .
( 8 ) All comrades in charge of school education work must conscientiously study the content and methods of teaching and the principle of unifying theory and practice in the content and methods .
In the methods of teaching , the pattern of enlightening , studying , and experimenting must be firmly adopted in order to develop the initiative and creativity of the students , and the empty pattern of injecting and coercing must be firmly abolished .
In teaching , , the practical material of the Shensi @-@ Kansu @-@ Ninghsia border region and its adjacent areas must be fully utilized by means of all kinds of investigations and studies .
( 9 ) In regard to the teaching and study of Marxism @-@ Leninism , the erroneous way of stressing the form rather than understanding the substance , and emphasizing inanimate learning rather than application , must be firmly rectified .
The school authorities and the teachers must give their full attention to enable the students to learn to understand the substance of Marxism @-@ Leninism and its concrete application to China &apos;s environment .
Whether the student has truly understood is determined by his ability to apply what he has learned .
Application means analyzing China &apos;s history and the current concrete issues and summarizing China &apos;s revolutionary experiences with the spirit and method of Marxism @-@ Leninism , so that the students form a habit of such application and become skillful in analyzing issues and guiding practice with the spirit and method of Marxism @-@ Leninism after leaving school .
( 10 ) In regard to political textbooks , CHIEH @-@ FANG JIH @-@ PAO documents of the Central , .and material published by the departments and commissions of the Central must be fully utilized .
The necessary texts and supplementary reading material must be systematically compiled and printed or reprinted .
The
Central Propaganda Department must , together with the publishing and fiscal organs , formulate the 1942 publication and budget plans relating to education for approval and promulgation by the Central .
( 11 ) In regard to the students1 living and the educational facilities of the schools , the necessary improvements to existing conditions must be made .
( 12 ) The school administrative organ must follow the principle of being compact and efficient .
The task of the party branch in the school is to assure the completion of the education plan and to rectify the incorrect situation of the party branch and the school administration being on the same level .
The party branch may make suggestions regarding school administration via the party line , but it must not do so out of interference .
In schools of the nature of the united front , the workstyle of party members monopolizing everything must be rectified .
( 13 ) The academic trend of free thinking , seeking the truth through the facts , diligent study , observance of discipline , voluntary selfgovernment , and uniting and helping one another must be built in the school , while subjectivism , sectarianism , seeking the high and the far , arbitrariness and blind following , bragging , considering oneself correct , and the bad habit of learning superficially without profound understanding must be firmly opposed .
The faculty and staff must serve as models in building the desirable academic trend .
( 14 ) This decision is applicable in Yenan , but all the basic principles contained herein are also applicable in the resist @-@ Japan , bases .

RESOLUTION OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE ON THE LAND POLICY IN RESIST @-@ JAPAN BASES
Passed by the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee Politburo 28 January 1942
&#91; Text &#93; Since the beginning of the resistance war , the land policy of our party introduced in the various resist @-@ Japan bases is the land policy of the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front and of reducing rents and interest while enforcing their payment .
Since its implementation in the resist @-@ Japan bases the policy has won the support of the broad masses , united the people of all classes and strata , and aided the resistance war behind the enemy lines .
In all areas where the implementation of reduced rents and interest and their payment is relatively general , conscientious and thorough , the positivity of the masses in the anti @-@ Japanese struggle and democratic construction is relatively high , normal work conditions are maintained , the social living order is stabilized , and the base is relatively consolidated .
Nevertheless , the policy has not been generally , conscientiously and thoroughly implemented in many areas .
In some bases only a part of the area has implemented rent and interest reduction , while in other parts it is merely considered a propaganda slogan and no decree has been issued , let alone implemented .
Or , although the government has promulgated a decree formally reducing rents and interest , the policy actually has not been conscientiously implemented , creating the situation of reduction in words only , without enforcement .
In such areas the positivity of the masses is not developed , and they cannot be truly organized to create a fervent resist @-@ Japan base .
Such resist @-@ Japan bases cannot be consolidated and , unable to withstand the enemy onslaught , they turn into weak areas .
Then , in other areas certain leftist errors have occurred .
Although the errors have occurred only in part of the areas and have been mainly rectified after the Central directives , they still require the attention of the comrades of these areas .
When the resistance war is entering a more difficult period , all bases are requested to launch even more vigorously the positivity of the broad masses in resisting Japan and in production and to rally even more vigorously all the resist @-@ Japan classes and strata in order to persevere in a long @-@ term struggle in the enemy rear .
After carefully studying the experiences of the various areas , the Central has made a summary decision of our
party &apos;s land policy .
The concrete method of implementing the land policy is attached hereto as supplements for adoption by all areas .
It is hoped that the comrades of all areas will study and conscientously implement them .
( 1 ) Recognize the peasants ( including hired help ) as the basic strength in resisting Japan and in production .
Therefore , party policy is to aid the peasants , reduce feudal exploitation by the landlords , enforce rent and interest reduction , and guarantee the civil , political , land , and property rights of the peasants in order to improve their life and raise their posi @-@ tivity in resisting Japan and in production .
( 2 ) Recognize the fact that the majority of the _ , landlords are _ anti @-@ Japanese and the fact that a part of the enlightened gentry supports democratic reform .
Therefore , party policy only helps the peasants by reducing feudal exploitation but does not eliminate feudal exploitation or attack the enlightened gentry supporting democratic reform .
Thus , after rent and interest reduction is enforced , payment of rent and interest must also be enforced ; after the civil , political , land , and property rights of the peasants are guaranteed , those of the landlords must also be guaranteed in order to rally the landlords to resist Japan unanimously .
Only in the case of traitor elements who absolutely refuse to repent is the policy of eliminating their feudal exploitation adopted .
( 3 ) Recognize the fact that in China today the capitalist production pattern is a relatively progressive one , while the bourgeoisie , especially the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie , is a relatively progressive social component and political strength .
The production pattern of the rich peasants has a capitalist essence , and the rich peasants are the rural bourgeoisie and an indispensable force in resisting Japan and in production .
The petty bourgeoisie , the national bourgeoisie , and the rich peasantry not only wish to resist Japan but also desire democracy .
Therefore , party policy is not to undermine capitalism and the bourgeoisie , or the rich peasantry and its production , but on the condition of suitably improving workers &apos; life , to encourage capitalist production and rally the bourgeoisie and to encourage rich peasant production and rally the rich peasantry .
Nevertheless , the middle and poor peasants are dissatisfied over that part of the exploitation of the rich peasants with a feudal essence .
Therefore , when rent and interest reduction is introduced in the rural village , the rent and interest of the rich peasants must also be reduced .
But thereafter the payment of rent and interest must be enforced , and the civil , political , land , and property rights of the rich peasants must be guaranteed .
In regard to those landlords who farm their land according to the capitalist pattern ( the so @-@ called operating landlords ) , their treatment is the same as that of the rich peasants .
( 4 ) The above three basic principles are the starting point of our party &apos;s Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front and its land policy .
As shown us by the experiences of the past 4 years , only by adhering to these principles will we consolidate the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front , correctly handle
the land issue , rally the entire people &quot; behind the national resistance war , and completely isolate the Japanese bandits .
Any ultraleftwing or ultra @-@ rightwing , one @-@ sided tendency will make it impossible to attain our goal .
( 5 ) On the rural united front , the conflicts between the landlords and the peasants , such as the former &apos;s opposition or obstruction of the latterTs demand for democracy and a decent living , must be suitably handled according to the above principles .
The rational demands of both sides must be satisfied , but both sides must subordinate themselves to the interest of the national resistance war as a whole .
When handling rural disputes , party and government work , personnel must not take the side of either the peasants or the landlords ; they must adopt the policy of reconciling the interests of both parties according to the above principles ,
( 6 ) The three @-@ thirds system of political power is a rational political form to reconcile the internal relations of the anti @-@ Japanese classes .
This system must be firmly , conscientiously , and generally Implemented in the Consultative Council and the government systems .
The idea that the three @-@ thirds system is merely a means to appease those outside the party is incorrect .
( 7 ) Government decrees must make provisions for both sides , neither favoring nor overburdening .
On the one hand the landlords must generally reduce rents and interest ; they must not resist or refuse to carry it out .
On the other hand the peasants must fulfill their obligation to pay rent and interest ; they must not resist or refuse to pay .
On the one hand the landlords retain their land and property ownership and , according to law , have the right to sell or mortgage their land , use it as collateral , or dispose of it in any other way .
On the other hand , when making such disposals the landlords must give consideration to the peasants &apos; livelihood .
All contracts on land and loans must be entered into voluntarily by both sides .
At the end of the contractual period , either side has the right to discontinue the contract .
( 8 ) In regard to funds for the resistance war , except for those who are absolutely impoverished , people of all classes must pay to the government according to the progressive principle , neither favored not overburdened ; they may not refuse to pay .
( 9 ) The implementation of rent and interest reduction constitutes the prerequisite for improving agricultural production , while agricultural production Is .
tUe major production in the resist @-@ Japan bases .
Therefore , party and government work personnel must devote their maximum effort to its development .
The government must make large amounts of agricultural loans in order to solve the financial difficulties of the peasants .
( 10 ) The main task of the Agricultural Relief Association before rent and interest reduction is implemented , is to help the government to enforce the decree reducing rents and interests .
After the implementation of rent and interest reducation its task is mainly to help the government settle rural disputes and develop agricultural production .
It does not replace
government decrees with its own decisions or replace the government with itself .
In the settlement of rural disputes , the means of arbitration , not dictatorial decision , must be adopted .
In the development of agricultural production , all members of the Agricultural Relief Association must be mobilized to produce an exemplary and leadership effect .
( 11 ) Reducing rents and interest and guaranteeing the civil , political , land , and property rights of the peasants constitute the first aspect of our party &apos;s land policy , yet many areas in the bases have not generally , conscientiously and thoroughly implemented rent and interest reduction .
The reason is either the landlord &apos;s refusal to implement it or the indifferent bureaucractic attitude of party and government work personnel .
Therefore , party and government work personnel of all bases must make a strict reexamination of their own work , send men to the villages to inspect the extent of implementation , conduct a careful investigation and study , generally summarize the experiences of the various areas , publicize instances of correct implementation , and criticize instances of bureaucratism .
We must know that a big gap often exists betwen issuing slogans and decrees and implementing them .
If bureaucractism is @-@ not severely rejected and rightwing viewpoints opposed , it will be impossible to implement the slogans and decrees .
( 12 ) Payment of rent and interest and guaranteeing the civil , political , land , and property rights of the landlords constitute the second aspect of our party &apos;s land policy , yet leftwing errors of neglecting this aspect have occurred in the bases .
The reason is either a lack of understanding of our party &apos;s land policy on the part of the peasants or a lack of understanding , or complete misunderstanding , of it on the part of party and government work personnel .
To prevent a repetition of such errors in the future , party policy must be clearly explained to party members and the peasant masses so that they will know that our party &apos;s land policy in the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front is fundamentally different from that of the civil war period and will refrain from restricting themselves to narrow present benefits , but instead link present and future benefits and the partial benefit and that of the entire nation .
We must convince the peasants that , after implementing rent and interest reduction and guaranteeing their civil , political , land , and property rights , we will enforce rent and interest payment and guarantee the same rights to the landlords .
Similarly , on the issue of rent and interest reduction and guaranteeing the civil , political , land , and property rights of the peasants , we must convince the landlords not to restrict themselves to the narrow present benefit but consider the benefit of the future and the entire nation .

SUPPLEMENTS TO THE RESOLUTION OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST- PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE ON THE LAND POLICY IN RESIST @-@ JAPAN BASES
6 February 1942
&#91; Text &#93; In view of the different conditions in the various bases , and even in the same base , a uniform system in regard to the concrete method of solving the land issue cannot be followed .
The Central has provided the principles for unified implementation in its resolution on the land policy , while these supplements propose the concrete method based on such principles for adoption by the various areas .
In regard to the items listed in these supplements , all those compatible with the practical conditions of the particular areas must be firmly implemented ; in regard to items which are incompatible with the local conditions and require modification , the various areas may modify them , but they must report such modifications to the Central and obtain its approval .
( Supplement I ) On the Issues of Land Rent and Tenancy Rights
( 1 ) In all areas where rents have not been reduced , the amount of rent must be lowered by 25 percent ( 25 @-@ percent rent reduction ) in principle .
In other words , the amount of rent must be reduced by 25 percent compared with that before the beginning of the resistance war ; this is applicable to public , private , and tenancy land and land farmed in partnership , whether in forms of cash , payment in kind , payment by labor , or fixed amount .
In regard to the different forms of partnership farming , the landlordTs share must not be uniformly specified as not more than 40 or 60 percent .
It must be decided according to the labor , plow animal , farm tools , fertilizer , seed , and food grain contributed by the owner and the tenant and reduced by 25 percent from the existing rental .
In guerilla areas and in the vicinity of enemy @-@ occupied areas , the reduction may be somewhat less than 25 percent .
It should be a reduction of 20 , 15 , or 10 percent for the purpose of activating the positivity of the peasants in resisting Japan and rallying the various classes and strata in the war .
( 2 ) Land rent is uniformly paid after the harvest .
The lessor may not ask the lessee to pay in advance or demand any extra compensation .
( 3 ) Where the entire or greater part of the crop is destroyed due to natural disaster or human calamity , fixed rent ( iron rent ) may be exempted or reduced .
( 4 ) Rent arrears for many years must be canceled .
( 5 ) The owner and tenant are both responsible for public grain and public funds according to the progressive principle .
The landlord is responsible for the land tax .
( 6 ) Where the land rent is to be paid in paper currency and a dispute arises due to its devaluation , the government must summon both parties to a meeting to settle it , and the paper currency rental , in part or in whole , may be changed to payment in kind .
( 7 ) In areas where such reconciliation organs as rental evaluation committees have been formed , the meeting must be participated in by the peasant , the landlord , and the government , but the government has the right to make the final decision .
( 8 ) Where there is a permanent tenancy right by contract or by usage , such right must be preserved .
Where there is no such right , it must not be provided by coercion .
However , both sides may be encouraged to form a relatively long @-@ term contract , such as for 5 years or more , in order to enable the peasant to settle down and develop production .
( 9 ) In regard to land under no permanent tenancy right or land where the contractual period has expired , the lessor has the freedom of disposal according to the contract , including transferring , mortgaging , selling , farming by himself , and hiring help to farm .
Nevertheless , during the resistance war period the landlord must give consideration to the livelihood of the tenant when repossessing the land , and he must notify the tenant of his intention to repossess 3 months before the harvest .
Where the tenant is extremely impoverished , the government must summon both sides to reach an accomodation , either by extending the tenancy period or by returning only a part of the tenancy land .
( 10 ) Where the owner wishes to lease , mortgage , or sell the land upon the expiration of the tenancy contract , the original tenant has priority to lease , take the mortgage , or buy according to the terms set forth by the owner .
( 11 ) Where the lessor sells the land under permanent tenancy right or before the contract has expired , the existing lessee has the right to continue his tenancy , and the new owner may not lease the land to anyone else before the expiration of the term .
( 12 ) Where the lessee fails to cultivate the land for 2 years for no valid reason , or where he intentionally fails to pay rent though able to do so , the lessor has the right to repossess .
( Supplement II ) On the Issue of Debts
( 1 ) Interest reduction is a necessary policy dealing with the loan relations formed before the resistance war in answer to the demands of the debtors as well as for rallying the creditors to resist Japan .
Fifteen percent should be used as the standard to compute interest .
Where the interest exceeds the principal by 100 percent , the interest will be canceled and only the principal repaid .
Where it exceeds the principal by 200 percent , both interest and principal will be canceled .
As for the amount of interest on loans made after the beginning of the resistance war , the people must be left to handle the matter themselves according to local social and economic relations .
The government must not set the interest rate too low , as it may discourage loan making and become unfavorable to the people &apos;s livelihood .
( 2 ) The creditor may not rescind the loan contract due to interest reduction ; the debtor may not refuse to pay Interest after such reduction .
The creditor has the right to sue for payment according to law .
( 3 ) In regard to the loan relations formed after the beginning of the resistance war , where the debtor does not pay the interest or principal when due , the creditor has the right to dispose of the collateral according to the contract .
Where there is a dispute , it will be handled by the government , Where one form of collateral is used to secure several loans , the proceeds from its sale are distributed according to the chronological order of the contracts and the ratio of the loans .
Where the collateral is land ( land collateral ) , it is similarly handled .
( 4 ) Where the land has been mortgaged but has not yet turned into a sale , the mortgagor may redeem it by paying the amount of the existing mortgage .
He cannot change the terms of sale and offer another piece of land .
Where the mortgage has turned into a sale , there may be no redemption .
Disputes due to paper currency devaluation at the time of mortgage redemption will be settled by the government .
( 5 ) In regard to the loan relations formed after the beginning of the resistance war , where , due to natural disaster , human calamity , or other irresistible causes , the debtor is unable to fulfill the contract , he may apply to the government for relief , either by reducing the interest or by forgiving the interest but repaying the principal .
( 6 ) Where a debtor repays his debt with paper currency and a dispute arises due to its devaluation , the government will settle it appropriately .
( Supplement III ) On the Handling of Certain Special Land Cases
( 1 ) The land belonging to a traitor guilty of heinous crimes must , as punishment , be confiscated , placed under government control , and leased to the peasants to farm .
Where they have not participated in the traitorous activities , or where their misdeeds are minor , the family members of the traitor are not included in this provision ..
( 2 ) The land of a traitor under coercion must not be confiscated , in order to show leniency and seek his repentance .
Where no one is in charge of the land , the government will take charge on behalf of the absentee owner3 lease it to the peasants to farm , and restore it to the owner when he returns home and resists Japan .
( 3 ) In case of a landlord who has fled , regardless of where he has gone , his land must not be confiscated .
Where no one is in charge of the land , the government will take charge on his behalf , lease it out for cultivation , save the rental receipts , and pay the land tax and deliver the public grain on his behalf .
Upon his return , the land and the rental receipts to which he is entitled will be returned to him .
( 4 ) &quot; Hidden &quot; land which has never been taxed on the contract , or which has never been taxed , must not be confiscated , but the owner will be ordered to pay the tax and deliver the grain within a time limit .
Where he fails to do so within the time limit , Where he fails to do so within the time limit , the government will punish him appropriately .
( 5 ) In the case of clan or association land , the members of the clan or association will organize a management committee to manage it and use the receipts for the public welfare of the particular clan or association .
( 6 ) School land will be preserved for educational purposes , and the government or the local residents will organize an education fund management committee to manage it .
( 7 ) Church land ( land belonging to Christian , Buddhist , Moslem , Taoist , or other religious organizations ) will not be disturbed .
( 8 ) Public wasteland will be distributed by the government to the dependents of resistance war soldiers , refugees , and poor people for reclamation , and the ownership will also be transferred to them .
Tax on the land will be reduced or exempted for a specific period of time .
( 9 ) In the case of private wasteland , regardless of whether it was never reclaimed or was left uncultivated , the owner will have the first chance to reclaim it .
Where the owner is unable to do so , the government may find others to reclaim it and reduce or exempt the tax within a specific , period of time .
The ownership remains with the original owner , but the person reclaiming the land has a permanent tenancy right .

&quot; Reference Materials on the History of the Chinese Revolution , &quot; Vol 4 , Chinese People &apos;s University , 1957
COMMENTS BY YENAN OBSERVER 6 February 1942
&#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY , Yenan , 6 FebruaryHow to solve the land issue in China during the resistance war has been a momentous issue arousing the concern of patriots and economists .
The &quot; Resolution on the Land Policy in Resist @-@ Japan Bases &quot; passed by the Chinese Communist Central on 28 January has given a satisfactory answer .
The resolution starts out from three basic principles : ( 1 ) The peasants are the basic strength in resisting Japan and in production and must be given aid .
( 2 ) The majority of ChinaTs landlords are anti @-@ Japanese , and a part of the enlightened landlords also supports democratic reform , and they should be rallied .
( 3 ) The rich peasants and the petty and national bourgeoisie are relatively progressive strengths in China today , and the rich peasant economy of a capitalist essence must be encouraged .
Therefore , the resolution stresses the need for reduced rents and interest on the part of the landlords and their payment on the part of the peasants .
It further provides that the government must satisfy the reasonable demands of both the peasants and the landlords , guarantee the civil , political , land , and property rights of both sides , and thoroughly realize the famous &quot; three @-@ thirds system &quot; in its political power components .
The land issue is the most fundamental and serious social problem in China today . , The Chinese Communist Party is the political party which has solved , and is still in the process of solving , China &apos;s land issue .
The resolution will be enforced in the various resist @-@ Japan bases in North and Central China now under its control .
Without doubt , it will have a tremendous influence in the political life and public opinion of all areas in the nation .
A Yenan observer points out :
It is not only the policy of the Anti @-@ Japanese National United Front advocated by the Chinese Communist Party and the embodiment of the new democracy in the economic aspect , but the first realization of Mr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s land and peasant policies on this vast land .
The major newspapers and periodicals in Chungking are publishing series of articles on the land issue .
The Ninth Central General Meeting of the Kuomintang in December last year decided to form a land committee .
The publication of the resolution by the Chinese Communist Central at precisely this time will serve that committee as an excellent reference .
A point of special interest is that , in the
supplements to its resolution , the Chinese Communist Central provides for rent reduction based on the principle of a 25 percent reduction from the rental agreed upon before the beginning of the resistance war , and this is no different from the 25 percent reduction advocated by the majority of the Kuomintang .
The reduction , of 37.5 percent of the total grain harvest volume promulgated by the National Government on 30 March 1930 , to be enforced on 1 March 1936 , and the regulations to protect tenant farmers promulgated by its Internal Affairs Ministry in 1932 were both reiterations of the same theme .
Though such decrees were supported by the broad peasants , just people , and many disciples of the three principles of democracy , it is regrettable that , until after the start of the resistance war , the Chinese Communist Party has been the only one to implement them / firmly .
The Chinese Communist Central feels that , in order to rally all classes in the nation , launch a strategic counteroffensive , and thoroughly defeat the Japanese bandits , in addition to military and political reforms , only the adoption of a rational land policy will win the support of the peasant masses and attain the goal .

YENAN COMMENTATOR PREDICTS THAT JAPANESE BANDITS WILL BE SMASHED IK TWO YEARS 6 February 1942
&#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY , Yenan , 6 FebruaryAccording to the Hai @-@ t &apos;ung &#91; 3189 6639 &#93; NWS AGENCY , the NEW SHEN PAO , Chinese @-@ language edition of an official newspaper of the Japanese Army in Shanghai , said that there is really no need for China and Japan to fight each other and that Chiang Kai @-@ shek is responsible for the present erroneous policy .
With the exception of the Communist Party , the paper said , all circles in China consider peace the best policy .
Right now , peace is the only way to save China from following in the footsteps of the Ming Dynasty , the paper added .
The Yenan commentator refutes this viewpoint as follows :
With the exception of traitors , all Chinese people think that the war of -resistance is the best policy .
Today there is no alternative to the war of resistance to save China from perishing .
The Japanese fascists know that there is a Communist Party in China now , but they should also know that there was no Communist Party in China at the end of the Ming Dynasty .
At that time there was no Kuomintang , nor a Soviet Union , nor a Winston Churchill , nor a Roosevelt .
That is why the Manchus were able to overrun the Ming Dynasty .
The Japanese bandits can never conquer China today .
As long as there is a single Communist Party member , the Japanese will never be allowed to succeed in their intrigues .
After all , we have patriotic people and patriotic political parties all over China .
In addition , we have the formidable Soviet Union and the powerful Great Britain and the United States as our allies .
The victory of the Japanese bandits in the South Pacific is but an overture to their collapse .
Accompanying their victory is the dispersion and dissipation of their strength .
The short legs of the Japanese bandits have been stretched far and will be stretched even farther .
The farther they are stretched , the thinner they will become .
It will take only 2 years for the Japanese to be smashed .
All people in China are vigilant toward the Japanese bandits &apos; enticements to surrender .
We must persist in the war of resistance for another 2 years .
In 2 years , not only Japan , but also fascism as a whole will collapse .

CELEBRATING THE 24TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RED ARMY 18 February 1942
&#91; Text &#93; Today , 18 February , is the 24th anniversary of the Red Army of the Soviet Union .
This day reminds us of the birth of the Red Army .
It was born during the German imperialist attack on Leningrad .
Today the Red Army is again engaged in a life @-@ or @-@ death struggle against a fascist German invasion .
The Red Army this year is not only many many times stronger than it was at the time of its birth , but also much stronger than it was before 22 June last year .
Now the Red Army is at the greatest peak of its strength in its history .
Through 8 months of combat the Red Army has proven to be strongest army in the world .
When the world is divided into a fascist front and an antifascist front and the two fronts are engaged in a final decisive battle , the Red Army becomes the hope of the absolute majority of mankind .
This anniversary of the Red Army is a day celebrated by all mankind .
The Chinese people are more enthusiastic in celebrating this day because the Red Army has been a staunch supporter of China &apos;s national liberation since 1925 .
During the last 5 years of the war of resistance against Japan the Red Army has given us the greatest encouragement and assistance .
China expects the Red Army to be its main helper in defeating Japan .
The Red Army is now launching successful counterattacks against Hitler &apos;s invasion forces , which , although still in Soviet territory , are not far from their day of collapse .
In the near future the Japanese fascists may attack the Soviet Union , and the Red Army must be prepared to fight two enemies .
But we fully believe that if the Japanese fascists dare to embark on that adventure , they will certainly be defeated .
On the basis of many factors , we can predict that Hitler will be defeated in 1 year and Japanese fascism in 2 years .
These factors are the Soviet Union , Great Britain , the United States and China and all antifascist peoples of the world ; the Soviet Union is the model for all these countries .
The history of the Red Army tells us an indisputable truth : only an armed force united with the masses of the people is an unconquerable force .
We must publicize and learn this truth and strengthen the antifascist war according to this truth so as to hasten the arrival of the antifascist victory .
This is the mission of all the people of China and the people all over the world while they celebrate the 24th anniversary of the Red Army .

CENTRAL LINK IN CURRENT WORK TO HAVE BETTER TROOPS AND SIMPLER ADMINISTRATION 23 August 1942
&#91; Text &#93; It has been a long time since the CCP Central Committee adopted the policy of better troops and simpler administration .
If we examine how this policy is carried out at various anti @-@ Japanese bases , we will see that some areas are earnestly implementing this policy and have attained remarkable achievements .
This fact proves that the Central Committee &apos;s policy is suitable to the local situations at various bases and can be carried out .
At the same time , we also see that in certain areas and certain departments this policy is carried out reluctantly , passively , and , therefore , not thoroughly .
A few areas still do what they used to do without making a move to implement the policy , in disregard of the Central Committee &apos;s decision .
They regard their areas or departments as exceptions .
The reason , these areas cannot implement the policy of better troops and simpler administration and regard themselves as exceptions , we think , is a problem of understanding , or a lack of understanding of the meaning of this policy .
Therefore , to insure a thorough implementation , of the policy of better troops and simpler administration , it is necessary to explain the meaning of this policy .
Why should the Central Committee propose this policy ?
First , 5 years of war of resistance has resulted in an irregular border between our anti @-@ Japanese bases and enemy @-@ occupied territory .
The enemy relies on railways , highways and strategic points to surround us , while we rely on the vast rural area to surround the enemy .
A situation of mutual surrounding has developed , and a see @-@ saw battle is going on .
The rapid development of guerilla warfare behind enemy lines during the early stages of the war of resistance is over .
The problem from now on is how to conserve our own forces , overcome difficulties and endure hardship .
Whoever survives this serious crisis will eventually win .
As the enemy is currently engaged in a cruel mopping @-@ up campaign as well as gradual encroachment , the shrinking of our bases and the attrition of our manpower and financial resources are inevitable .
Therefore , we must gird ourselves and adapt to this changed situation .
Only thus can we continue our war of resistance .
The purpose of this necessary retrenchment is to conserve our own forces , overcome the difficulties , and , at the same time , prepare ourselves for a counterattack in the future .
The present retrenchment serves great developments in the future
Second , as fighting behind the enemy lines is frequent , the frontline is not fixed .
The troops and organizations are highly mobile .
Just as big organizations are not permissible under these circumstances , so too many non @-@ combatants in armed units are not permissible because they hamper troop movements .
Therefore , we must retrench to suit the needs of the war .
We must understand that organizations and armed units are formed to carry out a certain task , not just for the sake of the organizations and armed forces .
If the emphasis is on quantity during the development of an organization or an armed unit , then the emphasis should be on quality during the time of retrenchment .
We should , attach more value to quality than to quantity .
If we still cling to our old practice , unwilling to change , we are genuine dogmatists !
Third , during this cruel war our military bases are shrinking in size , and we face increasing difficulties in manpower and material resources .
In many economically backward villages the people &apos;s wealth is rather limited .
Therefore , in each base only a certain percentage of the population can be detached from production .
This percentage should not be too high .
Otherwise a contradiction will occur which can be best described as &quot; the pond is too small for the fish . &quot; The purpose of the enemy &apos;s &quot; triple atrocity &quot; policy toward our bases is to destroy our conditions of survival in an attempt to &quot; drain the pond and then catch the fish . &quot; Retrenchment is directed precisely at this clever policy of the enemy .
On the basis of the three understandings stated above , the Central Committee proposed a long time ago that the number of people detached from production should not exceed 3 percent of the total local population .
After proposing the policy of better troops and simpler administration , the Central Committee also proposed that the development of our main armed forces be suspended , In the future , the emphasis of military construction should be shifted to the strengthening of local armed units and the development of militia not detached from production .
This Is a consistent policy , a policy suitable for our bases behind the enemy .
All bases must thoroughly carry out this policy .
The meaning of the policy of better troops and simpler administration and the Central Committee &apos;s persistent advocacy of this policy is still not understood by all the comrades in our bases .
As a result , this policy is not being carried out thoroughly .
At the same time , there are some comrades who have either incorrect or one @-@ sided understanding .
These views are also harmful to the implementation of the policy of better troops and simpler administration .
Some people say : Although our armed unit or organization is topheavy , with a large number of people at the high levels and not enough people at the lower levels , we should look forward to the future !
Our armed units and organizations will develop in the future !
We think that this opinion is wrong .
Future development is a matter for the future .
We should put our emphasis on resolving today &apos;s problems !
If we do not think of a way to overcome today &apos;s difficulty , there is no future to speak of .
If we keep imagining about the future without seeing the facts before us , this kind of &quot; farsightedness &quot; cannot resolve any realistic problem .
Some people say : The Central Committee is right in proposing the policy of better troops and simpler administration , but the situation in our armed unit or organization is tolerable and not as serious as you estimate .
Why not let us maintain the status quo ?
We shall resolve this problem when the situation becomes serious.Why should we rush things !
This kind of opinion is also wrong .
The trend of development of the situation behind the enemy lines in the last 2 years plainly tells us that the expected serious situation will definitely come , and has already come in some areas .
The change in the situation behind the enemy lines is no longer a matter of estimate but a vivid fact .
If we do not alert ourselves to the changes or actively take appropriate measures to cope with the changes , we will be caught short when something suddenly happens .
This kind of farsightedness , adoption of a policy in advance and always taking the initiative to reduce possible losses to the revolutionary force , is an art of Bolshevik leadership .
If we do not make an effort and let everything run its natural course , we are also wrong , because this view is politically nearsighted .
Some people think : During the war of resistance we should follow the policy of Han Hsin &#91; 7281 0207 &#93; &quot; the more troops the better . &quot; Why should we implement the better troops policy ?
Of course , we sometimes need more troops to beat the enemy .
But there should be a limit to &quot; more , &quot; and the number of troops cannot be increased without limit .
The crux of the problem is whether our material and financial resources are sufficient to support them .
If we ignore this elementary problem of survival and keep building up the armed units , the result will be that the manpower , material and financial resources of our bases will be exhausted and our bases will be hard to defend .
Therefore , we are for &quot; quality troops &quot; rather than &quot; more troops . &quot; We oppose the theory of &quot; more troops . &quot;
Some people think : The work in our military base is heavy .
Bigger organizations and more cadres are needed to do a good job .
As we feel that the number of cadres is insufficient everywhere , how can we talk about &quot; simpler administration &quot; ?
It is true that some areas and some departments are not adequately staffed and should be strengthened .
On the other hand , is it not true that there is a &quot; forest &quot; of organizations with complicated systems and superfluous personnel ?
The central problem of simpler administration lies in adjustment of organization , adjustment of cadres , retrenchment of organizations , and reduction of superfluous personnel in order to increase working efficiency and expedite the solution of problems .
Therefore , we are for &quot; simpler administration &quot; rather than &quot; complicated administration . &quot; We oppose &quot; complicated administration . &quot;
All the above views have the same old weakness of one @-@ sidedness .
If a person persists in his viewpoints without taking the overall situation into consideration , he may justify his arguments and may even sound reasonable .
If we give the overall situation careful thought , these arguments are plainly inadequate .
Only the policy of better troops and simpler administration is a policy resulting from careful consideration of the overall situation , suitable for the actual situation behind the enemy lines today and capable of taking care of future developments .
We are Marxists and Leninists .
We must resolve problems practically .
Any one @-@ sided view toward any problem will quite likely lead to the error of subjectivism .
Implementation of the policy of better troops and simpler administration , first of all , requires thorough understanding .
Only after a real understanding of this policy can we earnestly , voluntarily and gladly implement this policy thoroughly .
The policy of better troops and simpler administration is indeed a central link in all the work at various bases now .
Implementation of this program must be reflected in all phases of work .
All administrative , military , financial and economic work should be reconsidered in light of this overall
policy .
Meanwhile , implementation of the policy of &quot; better troops &quot; and &quot; simpler administration &quot; should be linked with such specific work as economy of civilian power , cultivation of civilian power , development of production , self @-@ reliance , austerity and antiwaste .
The areas behind enemy lines are in a harsh war environment .
The situation changes rapidly , and more often than not very suddenly .
If the leadership organizations and cadres cannot foresee the trend of development , make instant decisions , or voluntarily change the policies , then we will be unable to cope with the situation or even suffer unexpected losses when we find ourselves in an adverse situation .
Finally , it must be pointed out again that the policy of better troops and simpler administration is a correct policy for overcoming present difficulties and striving for greater development in the future .
It is a policy that takes care of the future as well as the present .
It is a positive policy , not a negative policy .
It is certain that Japanese imperialism will be defeated .
It is also certain that we shall witness greater development in the future .
During this difficult period from now until the time to counterattack , our rank and file should be streamlined and better trained so that our victory and future development will be further guaranteed .

CCP CENTRAL COMMITTEE RESOLUTION ON UNIFYING PARTY LEADERSHIP IN ANTI @-@ JAPANESE EASES AND READJUSTING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONS
Adopted by the CCP Central Committee Politburo 1 September 1942
&#91; Text &#93; Since the war of resistance , the party leadership at various anti @-@ Japanese bases has been generally unified , and the relationships among party * political , military and mass organizations have been basically united .
As a result , we have sustained a situation of hard struggle for several years and coordinated well with the nation &apos;s war of resistance .
However , due to the poison of subjectivism and factionalism and the lack of understanding about certain political viewpoints and organizational relationships , there is some disharmony in certain areas in the relationships among party , political , military and mass organizations ( actually the relationships among party member cadres in party , political , military and mass organization systems ) .
Such disharmonious phenomena include an insufficient spirit of unity , uncoordinated action , each unit running its own business , insufficient respect for local party and government authorities on the part of armed units , lack of distinction between party and government functions , independence of party members in government units , monopoly of mass organizations by party members , selfish departmentalism , parochialism , etc .
These phenomena of disharmony jeopardize the defense and construction of anti @-@ Japanese bases and hamper the further progress of our party toward Bolshevism .
The construction of anti @-@ Japanese bases and implementation of democracy require unity of leadership in each base .
The cruelty of the mopping @-@ up campaign of the Japanese bandits , the tightening of the blockade line , the communication difficulties between upper and lower levels , and the increasing local and guerilla warfare characteristics of the war of resistance demand more flexibility in the relationship between the upper and lower echelons in various systems .
As each district ( each military district or each military subdistrict ) becomes more independent in its activities and unified leadership of such activities should be further broadened and strengthened , organizations in each district should closely coordinate with each other without giving the enemy any opportunity to take advantage of our weakness .
The Central Committee has made the following decisions :
( 1 ) The party is the vanguard of the proletarian class and the highest form of proletarian organization .
It should lead all other organizations , such as the armed units , government and mass organizations .
Unified leadership in anti @-@ Japanese bases should be exhibited by the existence of a unified party committee ( or central political bureau , branch political bureau , district party committee , and local party committee ) to provide overall leadership in each base .
Therefore , it is decided that the representative organization of the Central Committee ( the Central Political Bureau or branch political bureau ) and the party committees at various levels ( district party committee or local party committee ) are the highest organizations in each area to provide unified leadership over all party , government , .military , and people &apos;s work .
The former party , government and military committees in various areas should be abolished ( the establishment of these party , government and military committees was necessary and correct during the period the anti @-@ Japanese bases were being established ) .
The nature and the membership of party committees must be changed .
The party committee at various levels should not be just a party committee to lead local work .
It should be the unified leadership organization ( not just a joint conference ) for all the party , government , military and mass organization activities in that particular area .
Therefore , it should include essential , responsible party member cadres from the party , the government , and the armed forces ( the standing committee of the party committee should also include responsible cadres from the party , the government and armed units ) .
Such committees should not be made up entirely or mostly of party workers .
The work of these party committees should cover all aspects , such as the discussion and investigation of party , government , military , and mass work .
Their work should not be limited to local work only .
( 2 ) All resolutions , decisions or directives of the representative organizations of the Central Committee , district party committees and local party committees must be unconditionally executed by lower @-@ level party committees , same @-@ level military and political committees for the party , youth corps and armed units , the political department of armed units , and all party and youth corps members in mass organizations .
The superior and subordinate relationship among organizations in government , armed unit and mass organization systems still exists .
The resolutions , directives and orders of higher @-@ level government or military organizations and the decisions of higher @-@ level mass organizations ( before the promulgation of such resolutions , directives and orders , the important part of the document should be presented by responsible party members of such organizations to a same @-@ level party committee for approval or should have previously been agreed upon by responsible persons of party committees , but not all documents need approval ) should be unconditionally executed not only by lower @-@ level government , armed unit and mass organizations but also by lower @-@ level party committees .
Such resolutions , directives and orders should not be violated or shelved on the excuse that no instructions were received from a higher @-@ level party committee .
If a lower @-@ level party committee has any differing opinion on the resolution of a higher @-@ level government , armed unit or mass organization , reports may be made to a higher @-@ level party committee .
If internal disputes occur within
party committees in resolving specific problems according to the resolution of higher @-@ level organization , the principle of the minority obeying the majority should be followed .
Even when the responsible persons of government , armed unit and mass organizations do not agree with the opinion of the majority , they must execute the decisions of same @-@ level party committees , but they may submit their dissenting opinion to their respective superior organization .
( 3 ) The Central Political Bureau and the branch political bureaus are designated representative organizations of the CCP Central Committee .
Members of district party committees and local party committees are elected by a joint meeting of representatives from armed units and local party organizations with the approval of superior organizations .
District party committees and local party committees should include cadres from local party organizations , party cadres from armed units , and responsible party and youth corps members from government organizations .
Whether the main armed force should participate in the county party committee is to be decided according to local conditions .
County party committees ( without the participation of the main force units ) and district party committees should include responsible persons from local party , armed unit and government organizations .
Comrades who can administer all phases of party , government , military and civilian work should be selected to serve as secretaries of party committees at various levels .
Thus , party committee secretaries should understand not only party affairs but also military and government work .
Secretaries of district party committees are selected by branch political bureaus of the Central Committee and approved by the Central Committee .
Secretaries of local party committees are nominated by district party committees and approved by branch political bureaus and the Central Political Bureau .
In order to unify leadership over local party activities and party activities in the armed units , secretaries of branch political bureaus , district party committees , and local party committees will concurrently serve as members of political committees for military districts and subdistricts ( division or brigade ) , and deputy secretaries will be appointed to manage party work .
If the political committees of military districts or subdistricts are designated as branch political bureaus , then secretaries of district and local party committees may serve as alternate members of the political committees to manage the work in armed units only .
Secretaries of branch political bureaus , district party committes , and local party committees should handle all phases of work .
Aside from serving concurrently on the political committee , they should not undertake other specific work concurrently .
In special cases where secretaries of party committees do not have to serve concurrently as members of political committees , or members of political committees do not have to serve concurrently as secretaries of party committees , approval must be obtained from a higher party committee or the Central Committee .
The military @-@ political committees and political departments in armed units constitute a part of the party committee on the same level ( the Central Political Bureau , branch political bureaus , district party committees and local party committees ) .
They have the same prerogatives and obligations as other departments ( such as the organization department and the propaganda department ) .
Although they
are not subordinate to other departments or committees , they are different from other departments or committees in that they maintain a leadership and subordinate relationship among themselves .
Military policies ( such as troop expansion , principles of army building , political work , etc . ) and major policies concerning military actions ( such as strategic and tactical plans to counter enemy mopping @-@ up campaigns and postmortems on the plans ) should be turned over to party committees for discussion , but specific military actions are decided by the commanding officer who is also a member of the political committee ( party committee secretary ) .
( The final decision of the commanding officer and the political committee on military actions are made according to the regulations governing political work ) .
Unlimited democratic discussions will only lead to the failure of military actions .
The appointment and release of essential personnel in armed units is administered by military organizations according to existing regulations .
( 4 ) The main forces are armed units under the leadership of the party .
They are the cornerstone for the construction of anti @-@ Japanese bases and for sustaining the struggle .
They should regard the consolidation and defense of their respective bases as their foremost task .
The main forces belong to the nation , but they also belong to a locality .
In the past there was some leadership disunity in some anti @-@ Japanese bases , caused mainly by lack of an accurate and unified understanding on the part of certain leadership comrades of the main forces regarding the establishment and defense of the bases .
As a consequence , some of their policies ( such as the local armament and troop expansion problem in their military construction policy , and the unified revenue collection and unified expense disbursement problem in their economic and financial policy ) took care of the interests of the main forces themselves only and overlooked coordination with the entire work in the respective bases ; they even caused disputes with local party and government organizations .
In some districts , party and government leadership organizations do not have an in @-@ depth understanding of the principle that everything is subordinated to the needs of war .
They have not fulfilled their responsibilities as they should in regard to the replenishment of manpower , the guarantee of food and material supply , care for the family members of wounded anti @-@ Japanese soldiers , and struggle against desertions .
Hence the relationship between the armed forces on the one hand and local party and government organizations on the other is strained .
In the future , in implementing the unified leadership policy in each base , aside from making the local party committee the leadership party organization in various places , we must correct the ideological and policy mistakes on the party of leaders of certain main forces and leaders of certain local party and government organizations .
We must carry out the Central CommitteeTs policies concerning our bases and the military committee &apos;s directives concerning military construction .
In the future , the main military force must carry out the resolutions and decisions of party committees at various levels and the decrees of government organizations at various levels .
The main military force should also carry out the decisions of lower @-@ level party committees and lower @-@ level government organizations ( such as county , district , and township government organizations ) in places where the main force Is stationed .
If the main military force does not
agree with these decisions , reports may be submitted to higher @-@ level party committees and higher @-@ level government organizations .
All should constantly keep in touch with and help each other .
Military measures taken by main military force , such as troop movements , deployments , and martial law , should be observed by local party , government , and civilian organizations .
The main military force is responsible for the protection of party , government and mass organizations .
If the latter suffer any undue losses due to the negligence or indifference of the armed units , the responsible persons of the armed units should be punished .
If there is any dispute in the future , solutions should be sought locally through mutual discussion , and reports on the dispute and its solution should be submitted to a higher organization .
Reporting on disputes to a higher organization without trying to seek a local solution through discussion is objectionable .
( 5 ) The political power system ( political council and government ) is a system of power organization .
Their decrees and orders are compulsory in nature .
The relationship between party committees and the political power system must be clearly defined .
Monopoly of the work of the political power system by party committees , the mixing of the function of party organizations with that of government organizations , disobedience to party committee decisions , and conduct in violation of party discipline on the part of party member cadres in political power system organizations must be corrected .
In order to carry out the three @-@ thirds system , party leadership over political power system organizations should be limited to matters concerning principles , policies and general programs .
The party should not interfere with or monopolize the work of political power organizations .
Lower @-@ level party committees have no authority to change or refuse to execute the decisions and decrees of higher @-@ level political council or government organizations .
Party organizations and party members should set themselves as examples for executing the decrees of political council and government organizations .
The party should undertake political work to enhance the prestige of the political council and the government .
Party cadres and party members who violate the laws and orders of the government should be severely punished by party organizations .
Party leadership over the work of political council and government organizations may be exercised through party members and yoiith corps members .
Party committees and party organizations have no authority to command political council or government organizations directly .
Party and youth corps organizations must obey the party committee at the same level .
However , the working style of the party and the youth corps must be drastically improved .
These organizations should not compel people outside the party to obey .
Instead , they should convince them and embark on political work .
In the event the party and youth corps fail to convince the majority of the political council and the government and their suggestions are rejected , then the minority must obey the majority without violating the principle of democratic centralism .
If party and youth corps comrades disagree with the opinion of the party committee at the same -level and fail to firmly execute the decisions of the party committee , this constitutes conduct in violation of party discipline and should be reprimanded and punished .
The party must send capable cadres to work in political councils and government , and the phenomena of overlooking political power system work and keeping cadres in party
organizations should be corrected .
Under the three @-@ thirds system , the number of party members working in the political power system should be reduced , but their quality should be improved .
Party members and cadres working in the political power system must obey the resolutions , decisions , and discipline of the party committee , the party and the youth corps .
They should not take advantage of their position to engage in free action .
Here it should be pointed out in particular that party leadership over the political power system under the three @-@ thirds system depends upon the consistency of the words of party member cadres in the political power system with their deeds and their absolute obedience to the party &apos;s decisions .
Therefore , the tightening of party discipline among party members and party member cadres in the political power system is of great significance .
Care should be exercised in transferring party members from the political power system .
Before the transfer , the party member concerned should tender his resignation to the political power organization .
The relationship between the armed forces and the government must be improved .
Armed units should conduct educational programs to support the government .
Government organizations should guarantee provisions and transportation for the armed units .
Leaders of armed units should be elected to the government and political council .
Armed units should be models in respecting political power organizations and in executing laws and orders .
Unflawful activities of soldiers should be severely punished by military organizations .
Aside from expressing their opinion to the political council and the government in their capacity as citizens , government committee members , or political council members , all soldiers and military organizations have no right to interfere with the internal work of the political council and the government .
Political organizations in armed units should help the government as much as possible .
( 6 ) Mass organizations are bodies voluntarily organized by the masses then @-@ selves .
The party , government and armed units should not directly interfere with the activities of mass organizations .
Party leadership over mass organizations should be exercised through party members , the party and youth corps .
The loss of identity between party and mass organizations , or party monopoly of mass organizations , must be corrected .
Wherever possible , more than half of the committee members of mass organizations should be nonparty members .
The problem of party or youth corps members in government is the same as the problem of party or youth corps members in mass organizations .
The government should respect the independence of mass organizations , give necessary help to mass organizations , and ask mass organizations to carry out government laws and orders .
Mass organizations should apply for registration with the government according to the law in order to obtain their legal status .
If mass organizations violate government laws , they may be punished or even suspended .
Otherwise , the government should not interfere with the work of mass organizations .
Mass organizations should rally the people to support the government and armed units and to help mobilization work for the war of resistance .
But mass organizations are not political power organizations .
They cannot take the place of the government in arresting , trying or sentencing people .
Armed units and mass organizations should help each other , not interfere with each other .
( 7 ) In guerrilla warfare areas , because of their special characteristics , unified leadership should not only be clearly defined but also established , if necessary , among party , government , military and mass organizations .
Party committees and government and mass organizations in guerrilla warfare areas may be combined with the military commanding organizations or political organizations of armed units .
Cadres of party , government and mass organizations should undertake definite duties in regular armed units or guerrilla units ( such as serving as commanders or deputy commanders , or as members of party committees in the armed forces , or taking up work in the political department of armed units ) .
During military engagements , they should take part in the work of regular armed units or guerrilla units .
Between military engagements they should carry on their work in connection with their original positions ( such as party committee secretaries , county magistrates , or chairmen of labor unions ) .
( 8 ) Unified leadership is reflected in the mutual relationships among party , government , and mass organizations on the same level as well as in the relationship between organizations at higher and lower levels .
Strict implementation of the principle tliat all lower @-@ level organizations should obey higher @-@ level organizations and that all party organizations should obey the Central Committee is of decisive significance in the party &apos;s unified leadership system .
In implementing any system or policy , leadership organizations in various bases must follow the directions of the Central Committee .
In resolving new problems which concern the entire nation , the entire party or the entire armed forces , instructions must be sought from the Central Committee , and no organization should introduce new ideas , make decisions by themselves , or endanger the unity of party leadership ( with the exception of problems of local nature and decisions which do not violate those of higher organizations or the Central Committee ) .
Halfhearted execution of the resolutions , decisions , orders and instructions of the Central Committee by lower @-@ level party , government , military and mass organizations , ostensible obedience to cover up violations , or failure to seek instructions from higher @-@ level organizations and the Central Committee before resolving new problems which involve principles and which by their nature should not have been resolved as isolated cases are manifestations of &quot; impurity &quot; in party character and destruction of unified leadership .
Here we wish to ag # in remind leadership comrades of party , government , military and mass organizations that responsible party members of party committees and various organizations should not make any public declarations , talks , or broadcasts concerning the entire country , the entire party and the entire armed forces without the permission of the Central Committee .
The tests should be examined in advance by the party committee at the same level or appropriate persons of the party or youth corps .
The main points of public announcements to be issued by responsible persons above the level of members of branch political bureaus or above the level of division commanders must be reported or cabled to the Central Committee in advance .
No broadcasts should be made by local organizations , and all broadcasts should be made only by the HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY in Yenan .
A responsible high @-@ echelon cadre
of the party should realize how he violates the organizational principles of the party and .
jeopardize the unity of the party if he expresses his own political opinion in public without.the concurrence of equal @-@ level or higher @-@ level organizations !
( 9 ) In order to unify the leadership in our bases and improve the relationships among party , government , military and mass organizations , education programs should be conducted , the three undesirable working styles should be rectified , and the poison of subjectivism and sectarianism should be eliminated among party member cadres in party , government , military and mass organizations .
According to the decision of the Central Committee and Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung &apos;s report , cadres should be educated at cadre meetings to be aware of the overriding interest and to given heed to the overall situation .
Cadres should be called upon to criticize each other and to criticize themselves so that they will know the overall situation without any local or departmental bias and know the correct relationship between the entity and the locality , between higher @-@ level and lower @-@ level organizations , and between their locality and other localities .
Educational work in party , government , military and mass organizations should be strengthened in order to enable all comrades to know the importance of unified leadership and the revolutionary orders and decrees in our bases .
Here we should particularly warn the cadres in the armed units that whenever there is disharmony among party , government , military and mass organizations , it is usually the cadres from armed units who should bear a greater part of the responsibility , because they are armed and are apt to act on their own , slight party and government organizations , disregard discipline , act freely and destroy the interest of the masses .
Therefore , military and political cadres in armed units must constrain their subordinates , examine themselves , and appeal to their subordinates to support the party leadership , support the government , and resolutely execute the decisions of the party and the laws of the government .
Meanwhile , some viewpoints held by certain party members and cadres which are not in conformity with facts should be corrected .
These persons think that only the work of party committees or party organizations is called party work .
Actually , any work done by party members or party cadres , be it political , military , mass , economic , technical or cultural is party work .
Work of party organisations is only a part of the party &apos;s work ( party affairs work ) .
Obedience to party leadership means obedience to the party line , party policies , resolutions , decisions instructions and discipline .
Some party members give lip service to or distort the meaning of obedience to party leadership and do not seriously study or execute the party line , policy , resolution , decision , instruction and discipline .
This kind of attitude is wrong .
( 10 ) The strengthening of leadership unity in various anti @-@ Japanese bases is for the purpose of more smoothly conducting the war against the Japanese bandits .
&quot; Everything is subordinate to the war &quot; is the supreme principle of unified leadership .
It should be explained to everybody in the party that if our armed units are weakened , and if the war is lost , then our bases will no longer be able to exist , and all party , government , military and mass organizations will collapse .
Therefore , party committees , government
and mass organizations and all the people have the obligation to support the armed forces and strengthen their combat capability .
The party committees and government and mass organizations have the responsibility to resolve at any time such problems as the recruitment of troops ; supply and transportation of food , clothing and ammunition ; provision of barracks for the troops ; transportation , nursing , and care fbrthe wounded , sick and disabled persons ; and special care for the family members of anti @-@ Japanese soldiers .
Indifference to these problems is extremely wrong and harmful .
Members of the armed forces should also understand that without the coordination of party , government and mass organizations , armed units cannot sustain the war of resistance even for a single day .
Therefore , education should be strengthened in the armed forces so that all members of the armed forces will care for their bases , economize on manpower and material resources , respect party and government organizations , strengthen military discipline , and give party , government and mass organizations all necessary assistance .
Troop recruitment , materiel replenishment , transportation , and care for the family members of anti @-@ Japanese soldiers should be handled according to government laws and regulations .
Uncoordinated action can only jeopardize the war of resistance and harm the armed units themselves .
( 11 ) On the basis of the principle of this decision and actual local conditions , leadership organizations in various bases should establish relevant regulations in detail in the form of government laws , army regulations , party and youth corps rules , and mass organization regulations to resolve many specific problems in connection with unified leadership .
These rules and regulations , once established , should be reported to the Central Committee .

YENAN OBSERVER ON STALIN &apos;S TALK 8 October 1942
&#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY , Yenan , 8 OctoberCommenting on StalinTs talk with American correspondents on 4 October , the Yenan observer said :
&quot; This talk of Stalin &apos;s is of tremendous significance .
Not only will it enhance confidence in victory in the minds of all people in the allied countries , but it will also greatly benefit the unity of the allied countries and the great task of winning the war over fascism . &quot;
Concerning the second front , the observer said :
&quot; The opening of a real second front is tantamount to a death sentence for Hitler .
This is an inescapable duty of the allied countries and a priority duty more important than material aid to the Soviet Union .
As far as timing is concerned , this is the most opportune moment to open the second front .
If this moment is missed , it will be a great strategic blunder on the part of the allied countries .
The timely opening of a second front by the allied countries is the key to victory . &quot;
The observer dismissed the rumors spread by German and Japanese news agencies following Stalin &apos;s talk as their habitual tricks and not worth commenting on .
The unity of the allied countries will be further strengthened because of the defense of Stalingrad and Stalin &apos;s talk .
The days of fascist arrogance are gone forever .
For the aggressors , their demise is only a matter of time , the observer said .
CHIEH @-@ FANG JIH @-@ PAO , 9 October 1942
&#91; Text &#93; Concerning the declaration issued by the 10th Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee and the report of the Ad Hoc Research Commit -tes a reporter of this newspaper &#91; CHIEH @-@ FANG JIH @-@ PAO &#93; went to see the spokesman of the CCP Central Committee and sought his opinion .
His reply is as follows :
We share the plenary session &apos;s intention to persist in the war of resistance and strengthen unity .
For instance , the declaration said : &quot; Before the final victory we must endure the most difficult and most severe battles in order to annihilate the enemy and permanently cut off the roots of all evil , adhere to the essence of the principles of self @-@ reliance , and take into consideration the most difficult situations in our calculations . &quot; &quot; Today we should all the more stand fast with all our loyalty and courage and concentrate all the efforts of our 450 million people on combat . &quot; &quot; Externally , we must help and cooperate with each other in order to carry out the universal principle of equality for all mankind .
Internally , we must unite with each other and demonstrate our resolution to be sincere without any disagreement . &quot; There must be a nationwide sincere unity before we can shoulder the un @-@ precedentedly difficult mission . &quot; These words are all right .
From this we can see that on the most important external and internal policies the opinions of the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party are basically the same .
The 10th Plenary Session should be congratulated for this gesture .
Since the beginning of the war of resistance , the Communist Party , the 8th Route Army , and the New 4th Army have always stood on the foremost front of the war in defense of their motherland .
Although isolated behind the enemy lines under conditions of extreme shortages of money and equipment , suffering from hunger . , and blockade , and facing tremendous difficulties , they have always obeyed Generalissimo Chinag Kai @-@ shekTs order to cling to their defense line without retreating a step .
Generalissimo Cbiang has said : &quot; All people , no matter , whether they come from the north or the south or whether they are young or old , have the responsibility to defend their land in the war of resistance . &quot; Adhering to this instruction , Communist Party members and people behind the enemy lines organized guerrilla bands and coordinated with our main forces to resist the enemy army .
They have
been able to persist in the war effort for 5 1 / 2 years , to keep their strength as formidable as the Great Wall , and to resist the attack of 15 enemy divisions , which is about half of all the enemy forces in China .
That they are able to do so is not without reason .
As to the administration of various anti @-@ Japanese bases , they formulated many measures based entirely on Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s Three People &apos;s Principles , Generalissimo Chiang &apos;s &quot; Outline for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction , &quot; and the basic laws of the National Government , with special consideration for the opinions of local people _ i.These _ m _ easures _ &apos; have resulted in a harmonious relationship among the people , which is helpful to the war effort and to winning the war .
The Chinese Communist Party issued a declaration , &quot; To Meet the National Crisis Together , &quot; on 22 September 1937 .
The following four points were enumerated in that declaration : &quot; 1 ) Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s Three People &apos;s Principles are needed for China today , and our party is willing to struggle for their thorough implementation ; 2 ) abolish all policies of violence and all communist movements for the overthrow of the Kuomintang regime , and stop the policy of forcibly confiscating the land of landlords ; 3 ) abolish the existing soviet government and carry out people &apos;s rights policies in order to achieve unity in the form of government throughout the country ; 4 ) abolish the name and identification of the Red Army and reorganize it as the People &apos;s Revolutionary Army , subject to the control of the Military Commission of the National Government and ready to take up frontline responsibilities in fighting the Japanese . &quot; We have observed what we stated 5 years ago without any infraction .
Wot only shall we do our best to observe these four points during the war of resistance , but we are prepared to continue to observe these four points after the conclusion of the war of resistance .
This is with a view to seeking a sincere unity with the Kuomintang and other political parties and all strata of people throughout the country for fulfilling the epoch @-@ making mission of the war of resistance and national reconstruction .
The items listed in the Ad Hoc Research Committee &apos;s report are not any different in basic spirit from the four points contained in the aforementioned CCP declaration .
As to the attitude toward the Communist Party , the report of the Ad Hoc Research Committee , after enumerating various demands , declared : &quot; The Government treats everybody equally .
Not only will it not discriminate against anybody , but it will safeguard the rights and freedoms to which its citizens are entitled . &quot; This pronouncement is what we have been earnestly demanding for many years .
Now that we have this clear &apos; declaration ^ we feel greatly elated .
In short , all the viewpoints taken by the Chinese Communist Party are based on the principle of the united anti @-@ Japanese national front .
Anything in the interest of unity for the war of resistance will be sincerely carried out without exception .
This policy will be firmly adhered to and never changed .
We sincerely hope that the Kuomintang leaders will understand our sincerity for the interest of the country and the people in order to attain further cooperation .
If so , although the enemy is strong , it will be chased out of our territory , and a strong , prosperous and independent Republic of China will be successfully built before long .

&#91; Text &#93; Tomorrow will be the 25th anniversary of the Red Army of the Soviet Union .
The Red Army &apos;s counteroffensive has gained a crushing momentum and won unprecedented victories .
All antifascist people in the world rejoice in unison , and the Chinese people feel particularly elated .
The Chinese Communist Party Central Committee cabled its greetings yesterday .
The text of the cable follows :
On behalf of all comrades of the party and the Chinese people , the CCP Central Committee enthusiastically celebrates the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Red Army and the great victory won by the Red Army in its counteroffensive .
After 25 years of struggle , especially after 20 months of struggle against fascist invasion , Red Army Day has developed from a day of gala celebration for the international worker masses into a day of gala celebration for all of mankind .
On the basis of their own experience , all peace @-@ loving people in the five continents unanimously recognize the Red Army and the people of the Soviet Union as the bulwark against the brutal fascist force and the shock vanguard for creating a new world peace .
The counteroffensive of the Red Army in the last 3 months has elicited cheers and admiration throughout the world .
Everywhere in the world , people are studying the military and political lessons derived from the victory of the Red Army .
The counteroffensive of the Red Army is undoubtedly unprecedented in history , and its scale and momentum are steadily increasing .
The Red Army started its counteroffensive from the beseiged city on the Volga River on 19 November .
Three months later the Red Army had pushed to the vicinity of the Dniepr River , 600 miles west of the Volga .
It is only a matter of time until Hitler &apos;s bandit hordes are driven entirely out of Soviet territory .
Since the beginning of the Red Army &apos;s war against Germany , the world situation has undergone obvious change .
Now , as a result of the victory of the Red Army , the future face of the new world is clearer .
All forms of fascist systems and thought have forever lost their place in the world .
National freedom and political democracy have become the
unshakable principles of the new world .
We Chinese people welcome the advent of this new era .
We welcome the unity and effort of all antifascist forces throughout the world in striving for the advent of this new era .
Along with the victory of the Red Army came the significant victories of the United Kingdom and the United States in North Africa and the United States in the Pacific .
The United Kingdom and the United States are actively making preparations to fulfill their promise to open a second front on the continent of Europe .
The United States and the United Kingdom have abrogated their unequal treaties with China .
The foremost duty of the Chinese people in this new era is to be further united and to prepare themselves to chase out the Japanese aggressors as the Red Army did with the German aggressors .
We believe that because of the unification and struggle of the Chinese people , the victory of the Soviet Union , the United Kingdom and the United States , and their assistance to China , we also can turn around to launch our counteroffensive and win final victory .
Long live the Red Army and its supreme commander Stalin !
Long live the victory of the war against fascist aggressors !
Long live the unity of China , the Soviet Union , the United Kingdom and the United States !

o CHIEH @-@ FANG JIH @-@ PAO , 22 February 1943
LETTER TO P &apos;ENG TE @-@ HUAI CRITICIZING HIS TTALK ON DEMOCRATIC EDUCATION &apos; 6 May 1943
&#91; Text &#93; We feel that your &quot; Talk on Democratic Education &quot; published 2 months ago is not quite proper .
I wish to present my opinion as follows :
For example , you start your talk with the definition of democracy , liberty , equality and fraternity , rather than with the political needs of the present anti @-@ Japanese struggle .
For another example , you did not emphasize that democracy is for the purpose of resisting Japan .
Instead , you emphasized that democracy is for the purpose of opposing feudalism .
For another example , you did not say that freedom of speech and freedom of the press are for the purpose of stirring up the people &apos;s positivism in resisting Japan or of seeking and protecting the people &apos;s political and economic rights .
Instead , you said that these freedoms stemmed from the principle of freedom of thought .
For another example , you did not say that freedom of assembly and association is for the purpose of attaining victory over Japan and the peopleTs political and economic rights .
Instead , you said that this freedom is for the purpose of enhancing mutual unity among mankind and for the benefit of cultural and scientific development .
For still another enample , you did not say that the Chinese traitors and those elements who destroy the unity of the anti @-@ Japanese front should be deprived of their freedom of domicle , movement , correspondence and all other political freedoms .
Instead , you said , only in general terms , that people should not be subjected to any interference .
Actually , for certain people in our various anti @-@ Japanese bases , democracy and freedom are too broad , too excessive and too unlimited , rather than too narrow , too little or too restricted .
This is why in November of last year the Central Committee issued an explanation concerning the magnanimous policy , stressing the necessity of suppressing reactionary elements ..
You did not adopt this policy in your talk .
For example , to promote the right of referendum in our anti @-@ Japanese bases now is not only harmful but also not feasible .
For another example , you said that there should not be any unequal regulations in the law , but you did not make a distinction between revolutionaries and counterrevolutionaries .
For another example , it is politically improper for you to introduce the slogan &quot; Don &apos;t give to others what we ourselves don &apos;t want . &quot; It must be realized that our present task is to
use war and other political means to defeat the enemy and that the present social foundation is commodity economy .
Both call for &quot; giving to others what we ourselves don &apos;t want . &quot; Only after the elimination of classes can we carry out the principle &quot; Don &apos;t give to others what we ourselves don &apos;t want , &quot; eliminate the war , and eliminate political repression and economic exploitation .
Among the various classes in the country today there is a kind of mutual assistance for the sake of defeating the common enemy .
But exploitation has not been abolished in our economic system .
Nor has suppression ( such as anticommunist activities ) been abolished in our political system .
We should ask for restrictions in exploitation and suppression and stress unity in the war against Japan .
But we should not propose a general and absolute slogan for class mutual help ( &quot; Don &apos;t give to others what we ourselves don &apos;t want &quot; ) .
For still another example , you said that the democratic movement in Western Europe started with a reduction in working hours for the workers .
This is not true to facts .
I have received &quot; Life Within the Party &quot; as you mentioned .
I will tell you if I have any opinion after reading the article .

CHAIRMAN MAO &apos;S CRITICISM AGAINST THE PTENG @-@ HUANG @-@ CHANG @-@ CHOU ANTI @-@ PARTY CLIQUE , 6 May 1943
COMRADE MAO TSE @-@ TUNG DELIVERS DETAILED REPORT ON THE DISSOLUTION OF THE COMINTERN
26 May 1943
&#91; Text &#93; Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung was greeted with thunderous applause as he stepped to the rostrum at a cadres meeting in Yenan on the evening of 26 May .
The meeting was called by the Secretariat of the CCP Central Committee to transmit two historical documents concerning the dissolution of the Cominternone from the presidium of the Executive Committee of the Comintern and the other from the CCP Central Committee .
After Comrade Jen Pi @-@ shih &#91; 0117 1732 2514 &#93; had explained the purpose of the meeting and Comrade Li Fu @-@ ch &apos;un &#91; 2621 8111 2504 &#93; had read these two documents , Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung made a report to the meeting in his capacity as chairman of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee .
Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung first pointed out :
&quot; The dissolution of the Comintern , as reported by American news agencies , is a great T epoch @-@ making event.T That in the last A days all countries in the world , no matter whether they belong to the antifascist camp or the fascist aggressors &apos; camp , and all political parties in the world have been paying extreme attention to this problem is sufficient to prove this point . &apos; &apos;
Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung asked :
&quot; Why should the Comintern be dissolved ?
Did it not work for the liberation of the working class all over the world , and did it not exert itself for the antifascist war effort ? &quot;
Comrade Mao said :
&quot; Yes , the Comintern was formed by Lenin .
During the entire history of its existence it rendered extremely meritorious services in helping various countries to organize genuinely revolutionary workers parties and in the great task of organizing the antifascist war . &quot;
Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung particularly pointed out the meritorious services rendered by the Comintern in helping the revolution in China .
He said :
&quot; The influence of the Comintern among the Chinese people is profound .
The reason is that although China is an economically backward country , it went through three great revolutionary movements in the last 22 years .
And the Comintern gave great help in these three revolutionary movements : namely , the Northern Expedition , the land revolution and the war of resistance against Japan . &quot;
Comrade Mao recalled how on the eve of the Northern Expedition the Comintern helped Dr Sun Yat- ^ sen and the Kuomintang under Dr Sun &apos;s leadership to reorganize the party in 1924 and subsequently concluded an agreement on CCP @-@ Kuomintang cooperation .
Recalling the historical fact that Mr Chiang Kai @-@ shek had gone to Moscow at that time on Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s orders and that Kuomintang representatives had attended Comintern meetings , he said :
&quot; This suffices to prove how great is the Comintern &apos;s help to the Chinese revolution and the CominternTs influence among the Chinese people , not to mention the subsequent land revolution and the war of resistance in recent years . &quot;
Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung also pointed out :
&quot; Revolutionary movements can be neither exported nor imported .
Although the Comintern provided help , the birth and development of the Chinese Communist Party can be attributed to the existence of an awakened workers class in China .
The Chinese workers class created their own partythe Chinese Communist Party .
Although the Chinese Communist Party has a short history of 22 years , it has embarked on three great revolutionary movements.1
&apos; &apos; Since the Comintern has rendered such great services to various countries and China , why should it be declared dissolved ? &quot;
Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung answered the question :
&quot; According to Marxist @-@ Leninist principles , the organizational form of revolution should be dictated by the need of the revolutionary struggle .
If the form of organization is no longer suitable to the need of revolutionary struggle , then that form of organization should be abolished.1&apos;
Comrade Mao pointed out :
&quot; At present the Comintern , as a form of organization of revolution , is no longer suitable for the needs of struggle .
If we continue to keep this form of organization , it will hamper the development of revolutionary struggle in various countries .
What is needed now is to strengthen the national communist parties in various countries .
This international leadership center is no longer necessary .
The reasons are threefold : First , the situations within each nation and among nations are more complicated than before , and these situations change more rapidly than
before .
A unified International organization is not suitable to cope with the complicated and rapidly changing situations .
Correct leadership must be based on careful study of these situations .
This -makes it all the more necessary for the communist party of each country to study its own situation .
The Comintern , remote from the scene of actual struggle in each country , was adequate when the situation was relatively simple and changes were not so rapid .
It is inadequate now .
Second , the fascist bandits have created a deep chasm among the nations in the fascist camp as well as among nations in the antifascist camp .
Among the antifascist countries there are socialist , capitalist , colonial and semicolonial countries .
Among the fascist countries and their vassal states there are also great differences in the type of countries .
In addition , there are different kinds of neutral countries .
To quickly and effectively organize all countries to wage an antifascist war , a central international organization has long been felt inadequate .
This has become particularly obvious recently .
Third , a leadership cadre has grown up in the communist party of each country .
These cadres are politically mature . &quot;
Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung used the Chinese Communist Party as an example to explain this point .
&quot; The Chinese Communist Party went through three revolutionary movements , and these revolutionary movements are continuous and very complicated , even more complicated than the Russian Revolution .
In these revolutionary movements the Chinese Communist Party had a superb cadre of its own which had gone through numerous crucial tests .
Since the seventh world meeting of the Comintern in 1935 , it has not interfered in the internal affairs of the Chinese Communist Party , and the Chinese Communist Party , during the entire anti @-@ Japanese war for national liberation &#91; deletion &#93; . &apos; 1
Comrade Mao Tse ^ tung summed up the comments emanating from various countries in the last few days regarding the dissolution of the Comintern .
He said :
&quot; All upright people in the allied antifascist countries applaud this action , but the reaction from the fascist countries is different .
All the bloody aggressors , who had concluded an &apos; anti @-@ Comintern &apos; pact , seem to be unwilling to see the Comintern dissolved .
Isn &apos;t it strange ?
They desperately denounce the dissolution of the Comintern .
In the allied countries the stubborn elements of the social democratic party in Stockholm and London , who at one time refused to allow the communist parties In their respective countries to join their party on the ground that the communist parties acted &apos; on the instructions of the Comintern , &apos; do not welcome the dissolution of the Comintern .
This is a rather strange thing . &quot;
&quot; Now the task of all antifascist countries in the world is to unify all workers movements so that the fascists will be forcefully and quickly defeated .
The stubborn elements in the workers movement are unhappy because the dissolution of the Comintern deprives them of an alibi , They even say that all communist parties in various countries should also be dissolved . &quot;
Comrade Mao continued :
&quot; This kind of opinion , which , lacks all coramonsense , probably has also appeared in China .
Let us take a look .
But I believe that the majority of &#91; deletion &#93; this opinion , because this kind of opinion lacks the minimum amount of commonsense . &quot;
Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung said :
&quot; The dissolution of the Comintern is not intended to weaken the communist parties in various countries but to strengthen them and to make them more national in character and more suitable to the needs of the antifascist war .
The rectification movement in our party in recent years to correct such undesirable things as subjectivism , sectarianism and a stereotyped party writing style is precisely for the purpose of making the Chinese Communist Party more national in character and more suitable to the needs of the war of resistance and national reconstruction . &quot;
Here , Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung pointed out in a very serious tone :
&quot; Now that the Comintern has disappeared , our sense of responsibility is increased .
Each comrade should understand that he is shouldering an extremely great responsibility .
Starting from this sense of responsibility , he should manifest the creativity of a Communist Party member .
We are in a difficult national liberation war .
The Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army are fighting an extremely strong foe behind enemy lines .
We are in a very difficult situation , and the war will last a long time .
But this long @-@ term hard struggle Is a good opportunity to train ourselves .
Let us think carefully and not say that we are always right after only a casual reflection .
Let us earnestly rid ourselves of subjectivism , sectarianism and the old stereotyped party writing style , and let us assume a completely responsible attitude and show a high degree of creative ability . &quot;
Comrade Mao emphatically pointed out the absolute necessity of the following two types of unity :
&quot; One is unity within the party , and the other is our unity with the people .
These are invaluable in overcoming difficult situations , and all comrades of the party must cherish these two treasures .
First , all comrades of the party must rally around the Central Committee .
Any conduct that destroys unity is a crime .
As long as all Communist Party members are united with one heart and one purpose , any strong enemy and any difficult situation will surrender to us .
Second , all comrades of the party should be skillful enough to unite with the people .
Here I wish our comrades to emulate Comrades Ch &apos;en Tsung @-@ yao &#91; 7115 1350 1031 &#93; and Tso Chi &#91; 1563 7874 &#93; , as recently reported by CHIEH @-@ FANG J1H @-@ PAO .
Comrade Ch &apos;en Tsung @-@ yao is a regimental commander of the Eighth Route Army .
He walked several hundred II with his whole regiment to carry rice .
Instead of riding on horseback , he carried rice on his back as the horses did .
Touched by his spirit , all
commanders and fighters of his regiment were high in morale and none of them deserted .
Comrade Tso Chi is a member of the political committee of this regiment .
He lost a hand in the war .
He was unable to lift a hoe in land reclamation work .
He stayed behind in the barracks and worked as a cook .
At lunchtime he carried food to the field for the fighters , who were deeply touched , &quot;
Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung made this appeal :
&quot; All cadres of the party should learn from the spirit of these two comrades , mix with the broad masses , and conquer all bureaucratism divorced from the
Comrade Mao said :
&quot; We Communists do not want to be officials .
We want to be revolutionaries Every one of us should have a thorough revolutionary spirit .
We should never be isolated from the masses even for a minute .
As long as we are not isolated from the masses , we will certainly win the war . &quot;

RESOLUTION OF THE CCP CENTRAL COMMITTEE ON THE PROPOSAL OF THE COMINTERN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE TO DISSOLVE THE COMINTERN
26 May 1943
&#91; Text &#93; ( 1 ) The CCP Central Committee fully agrees with the proposal of the Presidium of the Executive Committee of the Comintern adopted on 15 May 1943 concerning the dissolution of the Comintern .
As of today , the Chinese Communist Party is no longer under obligations arising from the constitution of the Comintern and all resolutions adopted at various Comintern conferences .
( 2 ) The Comintern has fulfilled its historic missions .
It has not only safeguarded revolutionary Marxism from being trampled by opportunism in Europe and Japan , helped progressive workers unite into genuine workers political parties , supported the socialist Soviet Union and staunchly opposed fascism and fascist war , but also used every means possible to help the liberation movement of the oppressed nations in the Orient and helped the progressive workers of oppressed nations organize their own political parties , which have become the people &apos;s vanguard in the fore ^ front of all liberation movements .
What is particularly hard for the Chinese people to forget is that the Comintern exerted all possible efforts before Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s death to make the CCP @-@ Kuomintang cooperation possible in 1924 and subsequently helped China bring the Northern Expedi ^ -tion to a triumphant conclusion .
Again , during the years from 1927 to 1937 , when the Chinese revolution was in the most difficult stage , the Comintern gave moral support to the Chinese people .
Recently , during the 6 years of war of resistance against Japan since 1937 , it appealed to its branches and the workers in all countries to help China in its war against Japanese imperialist aggression .
In short , throughout its existence the Comintern did the best within its ability to help the disaster @-@ stricken Chinese people .
Now , as the proposal of the presidium of the Executive Committee of the Comintern says , due to the fact that the domestic situation in each country and the international situation have become more complicated , this original form of organization is no longer suitable for the continued growth of the workers movement in various countries .
The reason is that in the current war of liberation waged by the antifascist allies it has become more necessary for the communist parties in various countries to solve
their own problems independently according to their special national and historical conditions , and to strive for a broadened and fast national high tide and national mobilization so as to win complete victory .
Another reason is that the communist party in each country has a well @-@ developed and politically mature leadership cadre .
Because of these reasons , the Presidium of the Comintern Executive Committee proposed to the communist parties of various countries the dissolution of the Comintern .
Under present circumstances , the benefit of the dissolution of the Comintern outweighs that of its continued existence .
Due to the present situation of the war , it is not possible to call an international conference to discuss the dissolution of the Comintern .
Therefore , this proposal was made to the communist parties of various countries by the Presidium of the Executive Committee of the Comintern .
The CCP Central Committee endorses the reasons stated in the proposal and approves the dissolution of the Comintern .
The CCP Central Committee pointed out that after the dissolution of the First International by Marx , the workers movement in various countries went through further development .
Now that the Third International is declared dissolved , victory in the worldwide antifascist war and the liberation of mankind will undoubtedly come sooner .
( 3 ) The founding of the Chinese Communist Party is a result of the development of the workers movement in China after the 4 May movement of 1919 , as well as the development of the contemporary history of China .
Wherever there are proletarian and workers movements there will appear someday a political party of the workers class .
If there had been no Comintern , the Chinese Communist Party would still have been born at some opportune time .
This is an inevitable rule of history .
Since its inception the Chinese Communist Party has , for the first time in the contemporary history of China , clearly pointed out for the Chinese people the anti @-@ imperialism and antifeudalism road .
In addition , all comrades of the party have set themselves as examples in their conduct , loyal and devoted to the liberation of their country .
They shed their blood and immediately take the place of their fallen comrades .
During its revolutionary struggle the Chinese Communist Party has received a great deal of assistance from the Comintern .
However , the Chinese Communists have been able for a long time to determine independently their own direction , policy and action according to the special situation in their own country .
Since the adoption of the resolution at the seventh conference of the Comintern in August 1935 that the Comintern shall not interfere with the communist organizations in various countries , the Comintern had always observed this resolution and had never interfered with the organization of the Chinese Communist Party .
The various revolutionary forces created by the Chinese Communist Party have been the pillars of China &apos;s progress in all aspects and have been undertaking an unpre @-@ cedentedly difficult struggle behind the enemy lines since the beginning of the war of resistance .
These revolutionary forces were built with bare hands and bare fists by the Chinese Communist Party independently and out any external help .
It may be said that this is unprecedented in China &apos;s revolutionary movement in the last few decades .
Revolution can be neither exported nor imported .
It can only be caused by the internal development within each country .
This is a truth always expounded by
Marxists and Leninists .
The practice of the Chinese Communist Party has entirely proven this truth , In this situation , , the dissolution of the Comintern will all the more strengthen the confidence and creativity of Chinese Communist Party members , consolidate the link between the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people , and further enhance the partyTs combat strength .
The Chinese communists are the best sons and daughters of the Chinese nation .
They will continue to stand in the forefront of the anti @-@ Japanese war , cooperate with the Kuomintang , all anti @-@ Japanese political parties and nonpartisans , support all the measures of the National Government in connection with the war of resistance , defeat the Japanese bandits and their German and Italian .fascist allies , and fulfill the task of establishing an independent new China .
( 4 ) The Chinese communists are Marxists @-@ Leninists .
Since Marxisms @-@ Leninism is a science , it has no international boundary .
The Chinese communists must flexibly apply Marxism @-@ Leninism according to their own national conditions so that it will serve the interest of China &apos;s war of resistance and .national reconstruction .
The Chinese communists are the best heirs of their nation &apos;s cultural , philosophical and moral heritage .
They regard this excellent heritage as a blood relationship and will continue to make it manifest .
The rectification movement conducted by the Chinese Communist Party in recent years to overcome subjectivism , sectarianism and the stereotyped party writing style is intended to bring this revolutionary scienceMarxism @-@ Leninism ^ -into close association with the practice of the Chinese revolutiona Chinese history and Chinese culture .
This movement shows that the Chinese communists have as much creative ability in thinking as in revolutionary practice and that the Chinese communists can stand together with the Chinese people to accomplish various historical missions assigned to them by the Chinese people .
The CCP Central Committee is deeply convinced that all comrades of our party can be united to conquer their own shortcomings and manifest their creativity and positivism .
If so , although Japanese imperialism is still strong and our road to progress is still fraught with difficulties , our tasks can definitely be accomplished .

COMRADE MAO TSE @-@ TUNG SUMS UP AT 1 JULY CADRES SOIREE THE HEROIC STRUGGLE OF 22 YEARS
1 July 1943
&#91; Text &#93; At a big soiree on 1 July , Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung summed up the events during the 6 years of war of resistance and during the last 22 years since the birth of the Chinese Communist Party .
He was full of confidence in the victory of the war and confidence in a new China and new world .
The auditorium was packed to capacity .
Attending were all comrades of the CCP Central Committee , cadres and nonparty member cadres at various levels of the party organization , visiting Japan Communist Party leader Comrade Okano Susumo , and visitors from the Soviet Union and the United States .
After the meeting was called to order by Comrade Li Fu @-@ ch &apos;un &#91; 2621 8111 2504 &#93; , Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung stepped to the rostrum in the midst of enthusiastic applause .
He began his report as follows :
&quot; Today is the 22d anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party and the 6th anniversary of the war of resistance .
At present there is only one task for all anti @-@ Japanese forces in the world and in China , the communist parties in various countries all over the world , and the Chinese Communist Party : to defeat the common enemy of mankindthe German , Italian and Japanese fascist aggressors . &quot;
Summing up the 6 years of war of resistance , Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung said :
&quot; China &apos;s war of resistance has been going on for 6 years .
As far as time is concerned , it is longer than the war in any other country . &quot;
He pointed out :
&quot; In the last 6 years the world war situation has undergone a fundamental change .
In the past , many countries in the world were under fascist attack , and the fascists were taking the initiative in .
attacking countries all over the world .
They were even victorious in their attacks and oppressed the antifascist countries .
This was the situation in the past .
This is to say that the situation was unfavorable and difficult .
Now the situation is fundamentally different , and a fundamental change has taken
place .
This change took place during the last year .
The victory of the Soviet winter offensive , the victory of the United Kingdom and the United States in North Africa , the victory of the United Kingdom and the United States in the Pacific , and the 6 years of war of resistance in China are the reasons for this fundamental change .
The great victory at Stalingrad in particular played a decisive role in turning the tide .
In the past the fascist aggressors ran wild .
The initiative was in their hands .
Now the fascist aggressors have lost the initiative , and the initiative has passed to the hands of the Allies . &quot;
Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung said in a firm tone :
&quot; The problem from now on is to defeat fascism .
This problem should be resolved in two steps : first defeat Germany and then defeat Japan .
Next year will see a decisive battle in Europe . &quot;
Comrade Mao pointed out :
&quot; Last year we said that a decisive battle would take place in Europe in 1942 .
But because a second front has not yet been opened on the European continent , the decisive battle did not come to pass .
The key point this year is still this second front in Europe .
The sooner the second front is opened , the sooner victory will come . &quot;
Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung further explained :
&quot; In the past we have pointed out tendencies and possibilities .
The reason the Communist Party often does this is to enable everybody to see the bright future in the midst of difficulties .
The passive position of the Allies has changed to an active position .
What was deemed possible in the past will become a fact today .
There is still no second front in Europe today , but this will certainly become a fact before long .
This is a goal all mankind is striving for . &quot;
Concerning the theater of war in China , Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung said ;
&quot; After the defeat of Chieftan No 1 Hitler . &apos; Chieftan No 2Japanese imperialism- * --will definitely be defeated .
Some people in unoccupied areas do not understand this and disagree with the strategy of defeating Hitler first .
This is wrong .
Now that the whole world has formed an antifascist war front , no country is at war in isolation .
Therefore , in deciding our strategy we should not just look at the immediate interest of an individual country .
Instead , we should see which battle should be fought first in order to obtain the best advantage for the entire antifascist front .
If we look this way , we shall realize that after the defeat of Hitler the going will be smooth in defeating Japan . &quot; .
After comparing the situation of our war of resistance 6 years ago and the situation today , Comrade Mao summed up :
&quot; We are certain that the bright progress pointed out in the past is close to realization . &quot;
Continuing , Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung summed up the history of the Chinese Communist Party in the last 22 years .
He compared the world during World War I with the world during World War II .
He also compared China 22 years ago with China today .
He pointed out :
&quot; The conclusions we draw from these comparisons enable us to strengthen our confidence in a bright new world and a bright new China , and they also enable us to know whither goes the worlds whither goes China , whether the world will quickly become a bright world , and whether China will quickly become a bright China . &quot;
Comrade Mao made a comparison between the two world wars and said ;
&quot; Within 30 years , two wars unprecedented in scale broke out in the world .
They are the inevitable results of world economic development .
World War I was correctly foreseen by Lenin .
The person who foresaw World War II was Stalin .
Their correct foresight proved that Marxism @-@ Leninism is the real scientific truth . &quot;
&quot; World War I was not a righteous war but an imperialist war .
At that time there was only the Bolshevik Party in Russia , and there were very few people In other countries who were really communists .
Meanwhile , the leaders of social democratic parties in various countries supported imperialist wars .
Most members of the social democratic parties were not awakened .
This was the situation 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; By the time of World War II the world had changed .
Among the Allies there are socialist countries , capitalist countries , colonial countries and setni ^ colonial countries , The communist parties in various allied countries take part in this war .
This war is a righteous war . &quot;
&quot; It was during the third year of World War I that the Bolshevik Party of Russia established a socialist country : the Soviet Union .
Twenty years later it became a principal participant in the antifacsist war of mankind .
Without the Soviet Red Army , without the Soviet people and their leader Stalin , and without the battle of Stalingrad , the destiny of mankind would be in doubt .
With the Bolshevik Party under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin , old Russia became the socialist Soviet Union .
This piece of territory occupied by a socialist country affected the entire world and has now played a leading role in the antifascist war of mankind . &quot;
&quot; As far as the world communist movement is concerned , following the victory of the October Revolution in 1917 , the Comintern was established in 1919 .
In the Orient , the Chinese Communist Party was established in 1921 , the
Japan Communist Party in 1922 , and the Indian Communist Party n 1923 .
Twenty @-@ two years ago the Chinese Communist Party held its first delegates meeting , and only 12 delegates attended .
Now our party has become such a big party . &quot;
Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung said :
&quot; In its 22 years of existence the Chinese Communist Party has gone through three big revolutionary movements .
Now it is working together with the Chinese people to organize a united front for concentrating our efforts to deal with the Japanese bandits .
Wow we are no longer just an isolated party .
All the people of the country and the world are joining us in opposing fascism .
We also have the Japan Communist Party and the Indian Communist Party joining us in opposing Japanese imperialism . &quot;
Comrade Mao Tse ~ tung ridiculed Japanese bandit chieftan Tojo , who was fond of saying &quot; one billion people . &quot;
&quot; But all these one billion people are against Japanese fascism .
The 450 million people of China , 400 million people of India , 100 million of Southeast and 100 million of Japan and Korea are all actually against fascism . &quot;
Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung voiced an enthusiastic welcome to Comrade Okano Susuroo , leader of the Japan Communist Party and representative of the Japanese people .
He said :
&quot; We have been living in the mountains for a long time .
We hope that Comrade Okano Susumo has something to teach us during his stay in Yenan .
Now our purpose is to be united to defeat Japanese fascism .
In the future our purpose is to build a new China and a new Japan . &quot;
Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung made a comparison between China today and China during World War I.
He said :
&quot; At that time there was no communist party in China .
The Chinese people were not awakened to such an extent as to be able to make a distinction between two types of foreigners , the bad ones and the good ones .
They were unable to divide foreigners into imperialists and good farmers and workers .
At that time Marxism had been in existence for 70 years , but our people did not know it , Our school teachers did not even know the name Marx as they talked about philosophy , economics and sociology .
At that time China already had old democratic culture , but not new democratic culture or new democratic art and literature .
Writing in the vernacular style was not even accepted .
China was one of the participants in World War I , but it only helped the imperialists .
Its own semicolonial status was not changed , but worsened . &quot;
-143 .
&quot; Today &apos;s China is a China in the midst of its war of resistance .
Its people are so awakened that they joined the international antifascist front to fight fascism .
They have a Communist Party , and they have made progress in culture .
We often take many of the progressive things right before our eyes for granted .
Actually , these things represent epoch @-@ making changes . &quot;
Comrade Mao said :
&quot; From this we can see that not only has the war of resistance caused fundamental changes in the last 6 years , but also the world and China are entirely different compared with 30 years ago .
This is great , earth @-@ shaking progress .
This kind of progress was made possible by man &apos;s own hands .
This antifascist war will inevitably create a more progressive world as well as a more progressive China .
The fascist attempt to drag the world backward is in vain .
To advance forward is our major direction . &quot;
&quot; Once we have a direction , we should have a policy , &quot; Comrade Mao said .
Turning to policy , he said :
&quot; Policy can be divided into two parts : one concerning the nation as a whole and the other concerning the Border Region and the anti @-@ Japanese bases behind enemy lines . &quot;
He said :
&quot; Concerning nationwide policy , the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made four proposals to the government in a declaration on the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the war of resistance .
The proposals are : &quot; Strengthen the war of resistance , &apos; &apos; Strengthen unity , &apos; &apos; Improve politics , &apos; and &apos; Develop production . &quot; As to what we shall do after we win the war of resistance , our party stated very clearly in its 7 July declaration that we wish to continue to cooperate with various political parties and factions for national reconstruction . &quot;
Talking about the party &apos;s policy in the Border Region and behind enemy lines , he said :
&quot; Now we have two theaters of resistance .
One is in front of the enemy and the other is behind the enemy , The struggle behind the enemy is very cruel .
We of the Chinese Communist Party have done a lot of work there .
In the last few years we have introduced many new measures , such as the &apos;anti @-@ mopping @-@ up &apos; measure , &apos; anti &lt; -encroachment &apos; measure , &apos; better troops and simpler administration &apos; program , &apos; support the government and cherish the people &apos; movement , &apos; support the armed units &apos; movement and the rectification movement to correct three wrong working styles . &quot;
Comrade Mao pointed out :
&quot; As to other places , we make suggestions as we see defects .
But in the Border Region and behind enemy lines the situation is different , because we can take action ourselves .
Therefore , we should do a better job . &quot;
Comrade Mao divided the partyTs policy in the Border Region and behind enemy lines in the last 6 years into two stages :
&quot; The first stage covers the first 4 1 / 2 years of the war of resistance , that is , up to the end of 1941 .
The second stage covers the last year and a half .
During the first stage the partyTs attention was focused on &apos; the following problems : How to organize a national anti @-@ Japanese united front , how to mobilize the masses , how to resist the Japanese strategic attack in cooperation with friendly forces , how to establish anti @-@ Japanese bases behind enemy lines and how to formulate such policies as the land policy , labor policy and the three @-@ thirds system policy .
All these were urgent problems to be resolved at that time .
During the last 1 1 / 2 years of the 4 years we were forced to &#91; deleted &#93; . &quot;
&quot; During the second stage , that is , during the last 1 1 / 2 years , in addition to continuing the above work , we conducted a campaign to rectify three working styles , a &apos; better troops and simpler administration1 program , a &apos; support the government and cherish the people &apos; movement and a Tsupport
the army &apos; movement , &quot;
Comrade Mao Tse ^ tung talked about the rectification movement in detail and said :
&quot; This movement assured political unity in the party &apos;s ideology and the purity of the partyTs organization . &quot;

REPLY CABLE FROM COMRADE MAO TSE @-@ TUNG TO THE SHANTUNG PROVISIONAL ASSEMBLY OF REPRESENTATIVES
1 September 1943
&#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY , Shantung , 5 SeptemberThe Shantung Provisional Assembly of Representatives sent a telegram the @-@ other day to pay its respects to the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung .
Comrade Mao cabled a reply on 1 September to express his congratulations .
The text of Comrade Mao &apos;s telegram is as follows :
&quot; Gentlemen of the Shantung Provisional Assembly of Representatives : Your telegram has been received .
Your assembly persists in hard struggle behind enemy lines , unbending , unyielding , demonstrating the righteous spirit of the nation , and setting a good example for everybody to follow .
No fellow countrymen can help but admire you .
At this critical moment we wish that your assembly and all patriotic soldiers and civilians behind the enemy will be united and continue to struggle for unity and progress in the war of resistance and to oppose surrender , disunity and retreat .
All patriotic countrymen are willing to help you .
The current world situation is extremely unfavorable to the German , Italian and Japanese fascist bandits and to China &apos;s shameless and reactionary surrender faction , which is rebelling against and selling out the nation or is ready to do so .
The iron fist of the Soviet Red Army will very soon break.the back of Hitler the beast .
The patriotic soldiers and civilians of our allies , the United Kingdom and the United States , are exerting efforts to deal their final blow to fascism .
The great goal of defeating Japanese imperialism and the liberation of the Chinese people are drawing nearer daily .

ON COOPERATIVES
( A Talk to Senior Cadres in the Border Region ) October 1943
&#91; Text &#93; There is another revolution this year in the development of production in the Border Region , that is , using the cooperatives to organize the public and private labor force .
As a result , positivism for production on the part of the masses is activated , labor efficiency is greatly upgraded , and production is greatly developed .
In the past , what restricted the production force in the Border Region from developing was feudal exploitation in the Border Region .
One @-@ half of the Border Region has gone through a land revolution which has broken up this kind of feudal bondage .
The other half of the Border Region has gone through rent and interest reduction , and feudal bondage was subsequently weakened .
This amounts to the destruction of feudal exploitation by more than 50 percent throughout the Border Region .
This is the first revolution .
However , if we do not undertake a revolution in the method of production by shifting individual labor to collective labor , our productive force cannot be further developed .
Thus , mutual help labor organizations built on the foundation of individual economy ( without destroying the foundation of the private property system ) , such as the peasants agricultural production cooperatives , become very necessary .
This is the only way to greatly increase the production forces .
According to the experience in the Shensi @-@ Kansu @-@ Ninghsia Border Region , the labor of two general processing and packaging workers is equal to that of three workers engaged in the same type of work elsewhere .
The labor of one model processing or packaging worker in this Border Region is equivalent to that of two or more similar workers elsewhere .
If the labor force of all the peasants is organized into a collective mutual help unit , the productive force of the entire Border Region can be enhanced by 50 @-@ 100 percent .
This method can be used in all anti @-@ Japanese bases , and in the future throughout the country .
This will be an event prominently recorded in China &apos;s economic
history .
In this kind of transformation there is no basic change in the means of production , and the fruits of production still belong to private individuals rather than the public , but the production relationship between people has changed .
This is a revolution in the production system .
This is the second revolution .
There is a total labor force of 350,000 people in the entire Border Region .
This year more than 30,000 people , or 10 percent of the total force , have already been organized into processing or packaging teams for collective labor .
As to temporary mutual help labor teams , as far as Yenan is concerned , about 70 percent of the labor force has participated in such teams .
A higher percentage of the total labor force will be organized into such teams next year .
If the labor force in various counties organized into collective labor organizations is increased from 10 to 20 or 30 percent , ; ; the number of people participating in collective labor will reach 100,000 .
Additionally , if all the counties can follow the example of Yenan in forming temporary mutual help labor organizations , and if all the part @-@ time labor force also participates in mutual help organizations , this will be a very big labor army .
Production in our armed units , organizations and schools also has some characteristics similar to those of cooperatives .
For instance , each company is a small cooperative , and each brigade is a big cooperative .
Among the various methods of cooperative production in armed units , organizations and schools , the experience of the Yang @-@ chia @-@ ling transportation team is worthy of our attention .
Before its reorganization this team had 8 wagons and 16 mules .
Under normal conditions it should have a transportation capacity of 270,000 chin per day .
But this team handled only 190,000 chin per day .
This team had to be given a subsidy of 60,000 yuan per month on top of standard provisions .
For both public and private benefit , this transportation team was reorganized into a cooperative this year .
It issued 80 shares against 8 wagons , 16 mules ( later increased to 20 mules ) , and other equipment , and 20 shares against the 20 transportation workers .
The total number of shares was 100 .
Each month 20 percent of the profit goes to the transportation workers and 80 percent to the cooperative .
All expenses for personnel , pack animals and equipment are paid by the cooperative .
It receives payment for its services according to weight and distance .
The cooperative is also responsible for improving the livelihood of the transportation workers .
This arrangement was unanimously agreed upon by the transportation workers after some explanation .
As a result , the transportation capacity increased from 190,000 to 389,000 chin per month , an increase of 100 percent .
It exceeded the normal capacity by 30 percent .
At the same time the sense of responsibility and positivism on the part of the transportation workers were greatly heightened , expenses and equipment costs were reduced and more care was given to the animals .
For example , in the past , when a wheat flour bag had a big hole in it , nobody paid any attention .
Now the transportation workers bring with them needles and thread , ready to mend the bags when they are torn .
In the past , cheating on animal feed was an open secret .
Now this kind of corrupt practice is gone .
In the past , when there was any damage to the equipment , requests were made for replacement .
Now they improvise .
In the past they
did not pay too much attention to the animals .
Now the animals are better fed .
The operating expenses of the team are down by one @-@ third after the reorganization .
In the past this team had to be subsidized in the amount of 60,000 yuan a month .
Now , without any subsidy , it has a profit of several tens of thousands of yuan per month .
Considerable results were achieved after this method was adopted by similar organizations .
The transportation battalion of a certain management bureau had 100 pack animals and 20 wagons .
Before reorganization its monthly transportation capacity was 1.2 million chin .
After reorganizing into a cooperative it raised its monthly capacity to 1.85 million chin , an increase of 50 percent .
Therefore , I ask everybody to give this kind of cooperative method some consideration as to whether it can be applied to publicly operated factories and farms .
These methods cannot be used by capitalist countries and the Kuomintang .
Only we can do this because our purpose is not to exploit the people , and we follow the policy of taking care of both public and private interests .
In the army , for instance , the 359th Brigade made equipment with willow and elm branches .
The regulation is that if public tools are used in handicraft work , SO percent of the proceeds goes to the public and 20 percent to the individual soldiers .
If no public tools are used , two @-@ thirds of the proceeds go to the public and one @-@ third to the soldier .
This method not only provides goods needed by the public but also tends to increase the subsidy for the fighters .
It also contains the idea of cooperatives .
The cooperative by nature is to serve the masses .
We have to think about the interest of the masses , calculate for the masses and put the interest of the masses first .
This is the difference between us and the Kuomintang .
This is also the starting point as well as the end of @-@ the revolution of Communist Party members .
We came from the masses and will go back to the masses .
In seeking solutions for problems we start from the interest of the masses and end with the interest of the masses .
Then we can do a good job in everything .
Therefore , every Communist Party member should think for the people ; the responsible comrades in the armed units should think for the soldiers ; and the responsible comrades in organizations and schools should think for the cooks and office workers .
This kind of production theory from the mass viewpoint tears down all the incorrect &quot; theories &quot; of the past .
Only this kind of theory for the masses can enable us to do a good job in production .
I want our comrades everywhere to pay attention to the promotion of production by cooperatives .
The production organization in armed units , organisations and schools is a kind of cooperative .
In addition , there are other cooperatives , such as the transportation cooperative of the salt transportation team and handicraft cooperatives organized by workers for collective mutual help .
Let us develop all these types of cooperatives .
Then the public , the private individual and the masses will be rich , and the present difficulties at various bases behind enemy lines will be overcome ,

SPEECH AT A CADRES SOIREE IN YENAN IN CELEBRATION OF THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION
ANNIVERSARY
6 November 1943
&#91; Text &#93; Today we meet in Yenan to celebrate the 26th anniversary of the October Revolution of the Soviet Union .
Last year , when we celebrated this occasion , the Red Army was defending Leningrad .
But within a year the victory of the Red Army turned the situation around .
The Red Army advanced from the Volga River to the Dniepr River .
The forthcoming winter offensive will bring a greater victory .
Without the Red Army the war situation would be unimaginable .
The victory of the Red Army affects the fate of all mankind .
This truth was made very clear a long time ago .
At the same time , within this year the combined forces of the United Kingdom , the United States and France wiped out the enemy in North Africa , Sicily and southern Italy , The Allied air forces also launched an offensive in coordination with the Red Army .
In the Orient , Chinese , British and American troops are attacking the Japanese fascists .
A week ago a three @-@ nation conference he.ld in Moscow by the United Kingdom , the United States and the USSR successfully accomplished its mission .
This also deserves to be celebrated .
This meeting resolved many military and political problems .
On 1 November a three @-@ nation communique was issued and several declarations of historical importance were signed .
Among the problems discussed and resolved during this conference , according to the communique , the most important is the decision on a definite plan of military action to shorten the war .
Concerning this action , preparations have been made .
From this we can presume that within a short time we shall see the opening of a second front .
Hitler will then be under attack from both east and west , and , consequently , the problem in Europe will be decisively resolved .
Once the problem in Europe is resolved , the backbone and the right hand of fascism are broken .
The remaining left hand , Japanese imperialism , will not be hard to break .
Among the resolutions adopted at the Moscow conference is the four @-@ nation declaration in which China participated .
Under the decision to carry the war of resistance to the end , the declaration provided an overall program
for safeguarding postwar peace and security .
The most important provision is that the cooperation among the four nations during the war will be continued after the war .
This provision shattered the intrigues of the German and Japanese fascists and the capitulationists in various countries who attempt to destroy the harmonious relationship among the United Kingdom , the United States , the USSR and China .
As a result , the four countries are more closely united than ever , and postwar peace and security are thus safeguarded .
The declaration also said that after the conclusion of the war a new league of nations , as an organization for safeguarding peace and security and including all big and small nations , will be created under the principle of equality and sovereignty .
We can imagine that this new league of nations will differ greatly from the old League of Nations ( although the Soviet Union was a member of the old League of Nations during the later stage of its existence , it was not permitted to play an important role ) .
It will be a united organization really capable of safeguarding peace and security .
The Moscow conference made decisions on basic principles and concrete policies toward Italy .
The basic principle is : &quot; Fascism and all its evil influences and all the things created by it should be eliminated entirely , and the Italian people should be given every opportunity to establish their own government and other organizations based on democratic principles . &quot; Article 1 of the concrete policy says : &quot; The Italian Government should accommodate the representatives of Italian people &apos;s organizations that have always been against fascism so as to make the government more democratic . &quot; Article 2 says : &quot; Freedom of speech , religion , politics , publication and public assembly should be fully restored to the Italian people .
The Italian people may establish antifascist political organizations . &quot; There are several articles concerning the elimination of the remnant vestiges of fascism .
One article concerns the establishment of local democratic governments .
According to these articles , the policy of eliminating all vestiges of fascism and establishing a broadly representative demo ^ cratic Italy with Communist Party participation is assured .
At the end of the declaration concerning Italy there is an announcement which says : &quot; The contents of this resolution are never to be construed to deny the right of the Italian people to make the final choice of their political system . &quot; The announcement establishing this principle says , in effect , that the Italian people have the right to select a democratic system or another more progressive system .
The declaration , concerning Italy made at the Moscow conference sets an example which can be applied to other fascist countries in the future .
This is entirely different from the results of World War I.
The historical imperialist spirit of Versailles has been destroyed .
The people of defeated countries are given a bright road to freedom and liberation .
This is a crystallized expression of the great spirit of internationalism of the people of the Soviet Union , the United Kingdom and other countries .
The Moscow conference declared that Austria will be detached from Germany .
At the same time it asked the Austrian people to exert efforts in the war against Hitler .
This also sets an example .
All countries and places gobbled up by fascism will be liberated .
At the three @-@ nation conference a joint declaration was issued by President Roosevelt , Prime Minister Churchill and Marshal Stalin .
This declaration establishes the principle of severe punishment of fascist criminals , and no fascist killer can get away .
At the same time the declaration warned : &quot; All those who have not touched the blood of innocent people should never collude with those murderers , for the three nations will trace them to the corners of the earth until they are brought to justice . &quot; This warning is intended to disintegrate the fascist camp .
Such a declaration with so much revolutionary significance was impossible during World War I.
In short , the success of the three @-@ nation conference is really epoch @-@ making .
It will deeply affect the war and the lives of people in the postwar period .
We can already see a ray of hope for the liberation of mankind .
Those who are pessimistic about the future of the Chinese people and the people of the world and those who entertain capitulationist ideas or ideas about unprincipled compromises have been proven entirely wrong .
We celebrate the 26th anniversary of the birth of the Soviet Union .
We celebrate the great victory of the Red Army of the Soviet Union .
We celebrate the brilliant leadership of Marshal Stalin .
We celebrate the epoch @-@ making achievements of the Moscow three @-@ nation conference , and we celebrate the great four @-@ nation declaration in which China participated !
We Communist Party members , our 8th Route Army , our New 4th Army and our fellow countrymen , soldiers and civilians should exert our efforts to support the four @-@ nation declaration , end the still @-@ existing danger of surrender and the danger of civil war , unite with all the patriotic forces in China , defeat Japanese imperialism and establish a new country with freedom and equality .
In the name of this new country , we shall participate in new international cooperation and international construction .
This is our hope .

LETTER TO YENAN PEKING OPERA ACADEMY AFTER SEEING THE SHOW TPI SHANG LIANG SHAN1
9 January 1944
&#91; Text &#93; After seeing your show I wish to thank you for the good work you have done .
Please also convey my thanks to the comrades who performed in the show .
History is made up of people .
On the stage of the old theater ( all old art and literature isolated from the people ) , people were treated like slag .
The stage was dominated by rich gentlemen , ladles , masters and misses .
This was turning history upside down , and it is now up to you to right it and restore the truth to history .
From now on , old drama will be given a new face .
Therefore , you deserve congratulations .
This beginning of yours is an epoch @-@ making beginning for the revolution in drama .
When I think about this I feel very glad .
I hope you will write more , perform more and establish a tradition to be promoted throughout the entire country !

COMRADE MAX ) TSE @-@ TUNG APPEALS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRY TO DEFEAT THE JAPANESE BANDITS
22 May 1944
&#91; Text &#93; A banquet was held on 22 May at Yang @-@ chia @-@ ling by the CCP Central Committee in honor of the workers delegates .
Following the banquet , a reception was held at the auditorium of the Central Party School .
The reception was also held to welcome Mr and Mrs ( Lin Mai @-@ k &apos;o ) from England ; the deputy director of the Shansi @-@ Chahar @-@ Hopeh Border Region Administrative Committee , Mr Hu Jen @-@ k &apos;uei &#91; 5170 0088 1145 &#93; , and members of the Northwest War Zone Service Corps who have just returned to Yenan f rom a certain area behind the enemy line .
At the reception a delegate of the workers presented a banner and paid tribute to Chairman Mao Tse @-@ tung and Commander in Chief Chu Te .
Amidst thunderous applause , Chairman Mao appeared at the rostrum and spoke to the delegates .
After briefly explaining the meaning of the reception , Chairman Mao said :
&quot; Now both foreign countries and China are struggling for a common goal : that is , to defeat fascism .
The purpose of industrial construction in our Border Region , like that of other work , is to defeat Japanese imperialism .
There is no other purpose .
It was only 5 years ago that the Border Region began to have a little industry .
At that time there were only 700 industrial workers .
In 1942 there were 4,000 .
Today there are 12,000 .
Therefore , the development of industry in the Border Region has been very rapid .
Although the number is small , its significance is great .
Those who fail to recognize this force , which has a bright prospect for development , which is full of vitality , and which can touch off other changes , are ignorant .
The goal of this meeting is to achieve , within 2 years , self @-@ sufficiency in industrial productsfirst of all , cloth and iron .
If we achieve complete self @-@ sufficiency , the number of our workers will be greatly increased .
All engineers , heads of factories and workers should exert efforts in that direction .
Communist Party members and nonparty members should also exert efforts in that direction .
People like Comrade Shen Hung &#91; 3088 @-@ 7703 &#93; and Comrade Ch &apos;en Cheng @-@ hsia &#91; 7115 2182 1115 &#93; are not Communist Party members , but their heart is the same as that of party members , struggling hard to defeat Japanese imperialism .
To defeat
Japanese imperialism we must have industry .
To enable China &apos;s national independence to have a solid safeguard we must be industrialized .
We of the Chinese Communist Party must exert efforts for the industrialization of China . &quot;
At this point Chairman Mao pointed out once again that the reason for China &apos;s backwardness is mainly the lack of modern industry .
He said :
&quot; The reason the Japanese imperialists dare to bully China to such an extent is that China does not have large @-@ scale industry .
They bully us because of our backwardness .
Therefore , to eliminate this kind of backwardness is the mission of our entire nation .
The common people support the Communist Party because we represent the demand of the nation and the people .
However , if we cannot resolve economic problems , if we cannot build modern industry , and if we cannot develop productive power , then the common people will not necessarily support us .
The Communist Party has been resisting and attacking 58 percent of the enemy troops and 90 percent of the puppet troops .
In this respect we have experience and achievements .
But as to economic work , especially industry , we donTt understand it too well .
Nevertheless , this field decides everything @-@ military , political , cultural , thinking , moral and religious .
It also decides social changes .
Thus , all Communist Party members should learn economic work .
Many of us should learn industrial technology .
Our Border Region is a big school .
Among the courses it offers is one called industry .
This conference of workers delegates is in fact a short industrial training course .
If we Communist Party members are not concerned about industry , not concerned about economics . , ignorant about productive work , skilled in nothing , and know only how to perform a kind of abstract &quot; revolutionary work , &quot; then this kind of revolutionaries has no value at all .
We should oppose this kind of emptyheaded revolutionaries .
They should acquire different kinds of technological knowledge to industrialize China . &quot;
After Chairman Mao &apos;s talk , the Northwest China Field Service Corps put on a show called &quot; Focus Your Vision Farther Ahead , &quot; depicting the hard struggle behind enemy lines .
The gathering ended late in the night .

PRESS CONFERENCE WITH CHINESE AND FOREIGN REPORTERS 12 June 1944
&#91; Text &#93; I am very glad to welcome you on your visit to Yenan .
We have a common goal : that is , to defeat the Japanese warlords and all fascists .
All China and all the world are united on this basis .
You come to Yenan at a time when a second front has been opened in Europe .
We wish to express our congratulations .
The opening of the second front will affect not only Europe but also the Pacific and China .
China wants progress .
The world wants progress .
We must win the final victory .
The opening of the second front was developed over a long period .
It was developed at the Moscow and Teheran conferences .
It was decided at these meetings to attack the enemy from three sidesthe west , east and south .
Now the second front has been opened , and the plan to attack Hitler from three sides has been put into effect .
We wish President Roosevelt , Prime Minister Churchill and Marshal Stalin good health !
All Chinese engaged in the war of resistance should focus their attention on their goal , work hard and coordinate with the decisive battle in Europe to defeat the Japanese warlords .
The prospects for success are very good .
Concerning the domestic situation in China , you gentlemen &apos; : are very much concerned .
Here I must say a few words .
Regarding the Kuomintang @-@ CCP relationship , the CCP has made its attitude known in newspapers and various CCP Central Committee announcements .
As you are visiting Yenan , I wish to reiterate the following : We support Generalissimo Chiang Kai @-@ shek and insist on cooperation between the Kuomintang and the CCP and cooperation with the Chinese people to defeat Japanese imperialism and build an independent and democratic China .
The policy of the CCP has never changed .
It was so before the war of resistance .
It is so during the war of resistance .
It is still so today , because this policy is the policy the Chinese people want .
However , China has its defects , great defects .
These defects can be summarized in one phrase : that is , lack of democracy .
The Chinese people are very much in need of democracy , because only when China becomes democratic can its war of resistance be forceful , its domestic and foreign relations be conducted in a proper way , its war of resistance be won , and
a good country be built .
Only democracy can enable China to continue to be united after the war .
The lack of democracy in China is well known to you gentlemen .
Only when China becomes democratic can she make further progress .
Questions and Answers Questions
Mr Stein : Chairman Mao , will you please tell us something about the progress of Lin Po @-@ chu &apos;s &#91; 2651 0130 3255 &#93; negotiations in Chungking ?
Father Hsia Nan @-@ han : Everybody is quite concerned about that question .
Will you please answer that question first ?
Mr Stein : In order to clarify the question , may 1 ask you , Mr Chairman , to make a comparison between the Kuomintang @-@ CCP negotiations of 1936 and the negotiations today ?
Mr Epstein : Is the opening of the second front bringing us to a new stage ?
Is the CCP Central Committee ready to issue a declaration to state its policy ?
Mr Hsieh Shuang @-@ ch &apos;iu &#91; 6200 3642 4428 &#93; : Tor further unity , what does the CCP expect of others ?
Mr Chao Ping @-@ hen &#91; 6392 3521 4024 &#93; : In order to clarify the question , may I pursue it : What does the CCP wish the National Government , the Kuomintang , and other political parties to do ?
What is the CCP itself prepared to do ?
Chairman Mao &apos;s Answer
&quot; Your questions can be summarized in three questions .
The first question concerns the Kuomintang @-@ CCP negotiations .
The negotiations have been going on for some time and are still going on today .
We hope that there will be progress and results from these negotiations .
Other than that , there is nothing else I can tell you today .
The second question .concerns the second front .
CHIEH @-@ FANG JIH @-@ PAO has already said in an editorial that the second front represented the opening of a new stage in the war .
We are not prepared to issue a declaration .
The opening of the second front is a development of the cooperation among the Allies in the war .
As compared with the past , the nature of this cooperation has not changed today .
But the opening of the second front has a significance somewhat similar to that of the counteroffensive at Stalingrad .
Before November 1942 the fascists ran wild , and the antifascists were beaten and retreating .
Fortunately , the Soviet Union &apos;s counteroffensive brought that stage to an end and opened a new stage .
Subsequently , counteroffensives were launched in North Africa and the Pacific This represents a great turning point for the Allies from defense to offense .
The opening of the second front also represents a big step forward in the offense .
Without it we cannot defeat Hitler .
Now Europe has reached the stage for a decisive battle .
In this sense it is a new stage , especially in the military aspect .
As I said before , the effect of the opening of the second front is very broad .
It directly affects Europe .
In the future it will affect the Pacific and China .
As far as the present is concerned , its effect on China does not seem to be very great .
You may see that although the situation in foreign countries is very good the solution of China &apos;s problem relies upon the efforts of the Chinese people themselves .
Just a turn for the better in the situation of foreign countries cannot resolve our problems .
The third question concerns the hope of the CCP and its own work .
To defeat the common enemy and establish very good and peaceful domestic relations and very good and peaceful international relations , we wish the National Government , the Kuomintang and all other political parties to carry out democracy In all aspects .
All the world is in a war of resistance .
Europe is entering the stage for a decisive battle .
A decisive battle in the Far East will also come soon .
But China lacks the democratic system , needed to further the war effort .
Only democracy can make the war of resistance forceful .
This has been proven by the experience of the Soviet Union , the United States and the United Kingdom .
China &apos;s experience in the last few decades and in the last 7 years of war of resistance also proves that point .
Democracy must be carried out in all aspectsin military affairs , politics , culture , party affairs , and international relations .
All these need democracy .
Undoubtedly , everything needs unity , and everything must be unified .
However , unity should be built on a democratic foundation .
Politics must have unity .
Only when politics is built on the basis of freedom of speech , freedom of the press , freedom of assembly and association , and democratic election of the government can it be forceful .
Unity is especially necessary in military affairs .
But military unity should also be built on a democratic foundation .
If there is no democratic life in the army , no democratic relationship between officers and men , between the army and the people , and between one army and another army , then this kind of army cannot be united to fight a war .
Economic democracy means that economic systems should promote rather than hamper the production of the broad masses of the people and the development of exchange and consumption .
As to cultural democracy , only democracy can help develop education , academic thinking , the press and the arts .
Democracy in party affairs means that the internal relationship within the party and the mutual relationship among the parties must be democratic .
In international relations , all countries should be democratic countries , and a democratic relationship should be developed among the nations .
We hope all foreign countries and our foreign friends will treat us with a democratic attitude .
We should also treat foreign countries and foreign friends with a democratic attitude .
I repeat , we need unity very much , but only the kind of unity built on the foundation of democracy is real unity .
It should be so in
domestic affairs ; it should also be so in the new international alliance .
Only with democratic unity can we defeat fascism and build a new China and a new world .
Our endorsement of the Atlantic Charter and the resolutions of the Moscow , Cairo and Teheran conferences is based on this viewpoint .
These are what we hope for from the National Government , the Kuornintang , other political parties , and people &apos;s organizations .
These are also what we are doing and hope to do .
Gentlemen , you have been visiting in the Border Region for more than 10 days , and you will stay in the area for some time .
You can see that all the work done by the Communist Party to defeat Japanese imperialism is characterized by the spirit of democratic unity or democratic centralism .
If we have not done enough , we should continue to work .
If there is any defect , we must correct it .
We are of the opinion that in China only a democratic system and democratic working style can defeat the enemy now and establish very good and peaceful domestic and international relations in the future .
This is also what we expect of Germany , Italy and Japan after the defeat of fascism .
If we look at many problems from this viewpoint , there is nothing we cannot explain , and there is nothing we cannot do successfully .
It is getting late now .
In the future we can exchange opinions .
This is all I wish to say now .

CRISIS ARISING FROM THE FALL OF CHANGSHA 24 June 1944
&#91; Text &#93; Changsha fell on 18 June .
The Military Affairs Commission announced &quot; After fulfilling the mission of eliminating the enemy , our troops made a strategic deployment according to a predetermined plan . &quot; Nevertheless , following the fall of Lo @-@ yang , another provincial capital has fallen in less than a month .
The seriousness of the situation is unprecedented in the 7 years of war of resistance .
The Japanese bandits &apos; attack in Hunan started at the end of last month .
On 27 May the enemy crossed the Hsin @-@ chiang River from Yueh @-@ yang and advanced southward .
In 10 days it reached the suburbs of Changsha .
The enemy bandits temporarily bypassed the city itself and continued to pursue the Chinese troops retreating southward .
The enemy took Ping @-@ chiang , Liu @-@ yang , Ning @-@ hsiang , Hsiang @-@ tan , Chu @-@ chou , Li @-@ ling and Hsiang @-@ hsiang .
On the 17th the enemy attacked Changsha , and the city fell the next day .
As far as the battlefront is concerned , this Hunan campaign is different from the various other campaigns since the fall of Wuhan .
The Japanese call these campaigns &quot; piston &quot; warfare , which means that they attack a place from their base in the morning and return to their base at night , or that they fall back after each attack .
Like the Honan campaign , the purpose of the Hunan campaign is to eliminate our field army , seize lines of communication , and thereby force the Chinese Government to surrender .
Therefore , against frontal attacks we can no longer use the same defense tactic which has been used in the last 5 1 / 2 years since the fall of Wuhan in dealing with &quot; piston &quot; warfare , in the hope that the &quot; piston &quot; will pull back by itself .
This time the enemy &apos;s purpose is to let the &quot; piston &quot; stop at the end of the cylinder without pulling it back .
The piston has stopped dead , and we must have a policy , a plan and the courage to fight our way out .
This calls for abandoning the defensive policy as well as the theory of sole reliance on weaponry .
In politics we must change the dictatorial policy and antidemocracy theories .
In brief , we must make fundamental changes ; otherwise we are in danger .
What is the mentality of the Chinese Government and Kuoinintang rulers ?
Their military and political policies remain unchanged .
In regard to military defeat , they say that it was due to lack of modern equipment .
Government spokesman Chang P &apos;ing @-@ ch &apos;un &#91; 1728 1627 5028 &#93; said at a press conference with foreign correspondents : &quot; We decided to leave the battleground
to wait for the Allies to give us more aid in manpower and weapons ... &quot; These people shout aloud for new weapons and airplanes as soon as the enemy starts an attack .
When we are routed by the enemy , these people put the responsibility on our Allies for not giving China enough new weapons .
However , the Honan and Hunan campaigns speak eloquently against this argument .
In Honan we deployed 400,000 troops against less than 70,000 enemy troops ( or only 40,000 enemy troops , according to another estimate ) .
The equipment of Tang En @-@ po &apos;s &#91; 3282 1869 0130 &#93; army far surpasses that of the so @-@ called &quot; nondescript &quot; units .
However , it was the so @-@ called &quot; nondescript &quot; units with inferior weapons ( units of Liu Mou @-@ en &#91; 0491 5399 1869 &#93; , Sun Wei @-@ ju &#91; 1327 1983 1172 &#93; and Ma Fa @-@ wu &#91; 7456 3127 0063 &#93; that firmly resisted the enemy .
The collective army corps under the command of Tang En @-@ po collapsed without a fight .
The losses were estimated at 200,000 men .
What was the reason ?
Weapons or something else ?
Tang En @-@ po is fundamentally opposed to the people of Honan .
The people of Honan say : &quot; Honan has four disasters : flood , drought , locusts and Tang . &quot; They classify Tang in the same category as locusts .
Inside Tang En @-@ po &apos;s units , officers and men are isolated from each other .
The troops consist of people rounded up by force .
On ordinary days they are berated and beaten , exhausted by hunger and fatigue and pale in complexion &apos; .
In the face of battle they just desert and run , having no will to fight .
Let us ask : What is the use of modern weapons in the hands of these troops ?
As for the enemy &apos;s modern equipment , it used its Third Armored Division in Honan , but it did not use any armored division in Hunan .
Hunan is crisscrossed by wet patty fields and mountains , and Hupeh has many lakes and streams where armored vehicles cannot be used effectively .
CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY reports have never mentioned any activities of enemy tanks or armored units , but it is well known that our troops in the 6th and 9th war zones are equipped with superior weapons .
The enemy had artillery pieces and machineguns .
Our troops also had artillery pieces and machineguns .
The enemy troops were occasionally supported by airplanes .
Our troops were fully supported by the 14th Air Force of our Allies .
Because of the forceful activities of Allied airplanes , the enemy bandits did not have any control in the air to speak of .
In weaponry there was not much difference between the enemy and us .
In numerical strength we had absolute superiority , In addition , the people of Hunan are traditionally brave and patriotic .
Just as in Honan , if we had implemented the correct policy of mobilizing the people and relying upon the people , our strength would have been immeasurably greater .
But our government and the Kuomintang rulers are unwilling to do so and unwilling to use all favorable conditions to strengthen ourselves in the war .
Instead , they put all the blame on lack of modern weapons .
If this kind of &quot; weapons only &quot; theory is followed constantly , China &apos;s battlefronts will only continue to deteriorate .
The saddest thing is that most of the Kuomintang troops , especially the central government troops , lost their will to fight .
This is the evil result of the defensive policy and the antidemocracy policy maintained by the Kuomintang rulers over a long period of 5 1 / 2 years .
Now that our
Military Affairs Commission is promoting &quot; attrition &quot; as a strategy , it will cause even further deterioration of morale .
Anybody with eyes can see that in Honan or Hunan it was our troops which were routed without a fight , or routed as soon as they were attacked .
There was no attrition of the enemy to speak of .
Instead , we ourselves are suffering from attrition .
This &quot; attrition &quot; strategy of the Kuomintang rulers seems to say that we shall trade territory for time .
In a certain sense , this strategy had some validity at the beginning of the war of resistance .
The situation is entirely different now .
Although our vast territory is one of the favorable conditions in the war of resistance , it is still limited .
If we lose territory as fast as we did in the Honan and Hunan campaigns , the time we may gain by trading all our remaining territories cannot be too long .
The fundamental question is : What is the use of time to the Kuomintang ?
Since the war of resistance , the time gained by using our precious national territory and the people in the territory as gambling stakes has been pretty long .
Since the fall of Wuhan , is it true that the front for which tbe Kuomintang is responsible has been in a stalemate situation for 5 1 / 2 years ?
Let me ask : How was this time used ?
Is it not true that they did not do a single good thing and did a lot of bad things ?
Now they want to trade more territory for more time .
The people will ask : What are you going to do with the time ?
Every theory , be it the theory of sole reliance on weapons or the theory o attrition , is empty words .
The present crisis can never be dismissed with these excuses .
In a word , the real trouble is the wrong policy of the Kuomintang rulers .
This policy , as we have repeatedly said before , is &quot; a policy of merely coping with the enemy attack or watching the war as a bystander , or a policy of putting on some show of resistance when the enemy comes and putting the hands back into the pockets when the enemy is gone , while concentrating all efforts on watching the people , oppressing democracy and opposing the Communist Party . &quot; This policy has persisted for a long , long period of 5 1 / 2 years and has been followed by all Kuomintang party , government and military organizations .
Now the enemy , in order to save itself from death , has changed its moving piston tactics to dead piston tactics .
As soon as the enemy makes a relatively strong attack , the party , government and military organizations of the Kuomintang are put in a helpless position .
If there is no fundamental change in the Kuomintang policy , future dangers can be foreseen .
Battles will continue to be lost .
Field armies will suffer more losses .
The Peiping @-@ Hankow and Canton @-@ Hankow Railways will be entirely controlled by the enemy , Kiangsu , Anhwei , Chekiang , Fukien , Kwangtung and Kiangsi provinces will be cut off by the enemy .
The bases of the war of resistance in unoccupied China will shrink .
The sources of soldiers will become more and more limited .
Our international position will be lower .
All kinds of crises will become acute .
It is time for the Kuomintang rulers to think about their basic policy .
The Chinese people have the right to urge them to make a drastic change and start anew with the people .
The present crisis lies entirely on the battlefront for which the Kuomintang is responsible .
The situation in other places is quite favorable .
The Allied forces have landed in Western Europe .
Deployment for a three @-@ pronged attack on Hitler from the east , west and south has already been effected .
The demise of the German bandits is imminent .
In the Far East , the Allied forces have not only broken the outer defense line of the Japanese bandits in the Pacific , but have also advanced to Saipan Island in the Marianas on their inner defense line .
In China , the 470,000 men of the 8th Route Army and the New 4th Army and the 2 million militiamen stand firm as a bulwark in their fight against the enemy and have put the enemy in a helpless position in the three big battlegrounds behind the enemy lines in North China , Central China and South China .
They are coordinating their efforts with the war effort in the frontal battlegrounds , tying down the majority of the enemy force .
The CCP has always insisted on unity , sincerely hoping for a better Kuomintang @-@ CCP relationship .
Under these favorable conditions , everything is ready except for a change in the policy of the Kuomintang .
We hope that the Kuomintang will make a change soon .
How should change be made ?
By changing passive resistance to active resistance .
By changing the policy of solely depending upon weaponry to associating weapons with people .
By changing the practice of watching and controlling the people to relying on the people .
By changing suppression , of people to implementation of democracy .
By changing opposition to the Communist Party to strengthening Kuomintang @-@ CCP unity .
By changing reliance on external force to fight Japan to coordinating our efforts with those of our Allies and by using mainly our own hands .
Only thus can we learn a lesson from the Honan and Hunan campaigns , defeat the enemyTs new attacks , overcome various crises precipitated by the wrong policy of the Kuomintang , and hope to coordinate our efforts with those of the Allies in the counterattack .

CHAIRMAN MAO URGES COMMANDERS AND FIGHTERS TO PERSIST IN ADVANCING THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE
18 September 1944
&#91; Text &#93; The office of the CCP Central Committee gave a reception in the auditorium of the Central Committee at 1400 hours on 18 September to welcome the representatives of model learners from the army corps stationed behind enemy lines and representatives of combat heroes who came to Yenan for training after their combat duties behind enemy lines .
The reception was attended by members of various departments of the Central Committee , members of various departments of the Political Bureau of Northwest China , and responsible comrades of army corps stationed behind enemy lines .
They met the representatives of the best fighters of the 8th Route Army stationed at various places .
This is the first big meeting ever held since the founding of the 8th Route Army .
Representatives of the heroic New 4th Army and people &apos;s armed units from South China were also invited .
Speeches were made by Chairman Mao , Commander in Chief Chu Te &gt; Deputy Commander in Chief Peng Te @-@ huai , Comrade Liu Shao @-@ ch &apos;i , Comrade Chou En @-@ lai , Commander of the New 4th Army Ch &apos;en I &#91; 7115 3015 &#93; and Commander Nieh Yung @-@ chen &#91; 5119 2837 5271 &#93; of the Shansi @-@ Chahar @-@ Hopei Military District .
Responsible officers of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao dined with the representatives .
During the dinner , Chairman Mao had intimate conversations with the fighters and commanders , and they toasted the final victory of the war of resistance .
In the evening the representatives were entertained with Peiping opera .
The performance ended late at night .
Chairman M # o met the representatives of model learners amid thunderous applause .
After briefly explaining the meaning of the welcome reception , Chairman Mao said :
&quot; You have been selected from the armed units .
You represent the 8th Route Army and the New 4th Army .
At the same time , you represent 90 million people in your bases , and you also represent the 450 million people all over China in attending this meeting .
Although you were not directly elected by them , the program you carry on and the work you do indeed represent the demand of all the people in the country &apos;defeat Japanese imperialism and liberate the Chinese nation . &quot;
Chairman Mao continued by pointing out :
&quot; Since the fall of Wuhan , especially in the last 2 years , a great change has taken place in the situation of China &apos;s war of resistance .
Now the 8th Route Army , the Hew 4th Army , and the people &apos;s armed units in South China are engaging five @-@ sixths of the puppet and enemy troops in China .
The Kuomintang units are engaging only one @-@ sixth .
In the Honan and Hunan battles the enemy just walked into noman &apos;s land .
This situation is very serious .
The reason China did not perish is that it has us , the Communist Party , the 8th Route Army and the New 4th Army to back it up .
Essentially , we have butressed the war of resistance .
This is the situation of China &apos;s war of resistance today . &quot;
Chairman Mao continued :
&quot; Our armed units have made great progress , whether in fighting the enemy on the front or in defending the Border Region in the rear , in production or in training , in soldier ^ civilian relationships or in officer @-@ men relationships .
However , we still have defects .
We have to correct our defects and seek improvement .
During last year &apos;s &apos; support the government and cherish the people1 movement we used the method of self @-@ criticism .
When we have defects we criticize each other .
An armed unit must have unified leadership and discipline before it can defeat the enemy .
Correct self @-@ criticism will not weaken leadership and discipline but strengthen them .
This kind of criticism &#91; deletion &#93; only in the Kuomintang army .
This is impossible , because our armed units are genuine peopleTs armed units .
Each one of our commanders and fighters and domestic animal attendants is serving the interest of the people .
Members of our armed units must mingle with the people .
Our cadres must mingle with the troops .
Anything that suits the interest of the people we must persist in .
Anything in conflict with the people &apos;s interest we must strive to get rid of .
In this way there will be no enemy we cannot conquer .
Our armed units always follow two principles First , we must be merciless toward the enemy .
We must overcome the enemy and annihilate him .
Second , toward our own men , people , comrades , superiors and subordinates , we should be kind and united .
This is the policy of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party as well as the policy of the Political Bureau in Northwest China .
This is also the policy demanded by all the people . &quot;
Finally , Chairman Mao shouted :
&quot; Our hearts must be closely linked with the hearts of all the people of China .
We must defeat Japanese imperialism and liberate the Chinese nation ! &quot;

YENAN AUTHORITIES COMMENT ON TALKS BETWEEN THE KUOMINTANG AND THE COMMUNIST PARTY , EXPLAINING THE NECESSITY TO REORGANIZE THE GOVERNMENT AND THE HIGH COMMAND TO AVERT THE CURRENT CRISIS
September 1944
&#91; Text &#93; It has been 4 1 / 2 months since Comrade Lin Po @-@ chu &#91; 2651 0130 3255 &#93; opened negotiations with government representatives Chang Chih @-@ chung &#91; 1728 3112 0022 &#93; and Wang Shih @-@ chieh &#91; 3769 0013 2638 &#93; in Sian .
During this long period of time , although the CCP Central Committee and its representatives are very tolerant , patient and compromising , there have been no results whatsoever because of the government side &apos;s obstinacy in its wrong policy , lack of sincerity and playing politics .
There has been no solution to any concrete problem , even the most trivial ones .
The proceedings of the negotiations have been reported to the National Assembly , which resolved to organize an inspection group to visit Yenan .
So the 4 1 / 2 months of : Kuomintang @-@ CCP negotiations have come to an end .
Therefore , we may make a general comment on these negotiations .
When Comrade Lin Po @-@ chu went to Chungking , the Japanese bandits &apos; attack on the Chinese mainland was just starting .
In view of the Kuomintang &apos;s wrong policies , which had placed the country in danger over the yearssuch as its negative and bystander &apos;s attitude toward the war and its reliance on the Allies to fight the Japanese in military affairs , its tyranny and dictatorship in politics , its monopoly in economic affairs , and its oppressive control in cultural affairsthe CCP Central Committee foresaw that China &apos;s war of resistance would encounter serious military setbacks and political and economic crises before the new Japanese offensive .
To avoid the crisis , the CCP Central Committee sent Comrade Lin Po @-@ chu to Chungking .
The CCP standpoint and principles in these negotiations had already been stated in a Letter of Opinion submitted to the National Government on 5 June .
The letter began : &quot; The CCP believes that overcoming the present difficulties , defeating the Japanese attack , and earnestly preparing for a counteroffensive can be achieved only by carrying out democracy and strengthening unity .
For this purpose , the CCP hopes the government will resolve a number of urgent problems . &quot; From this Letter of Opinion one can perceive the CCP &apos;s calm and clear understanding of the situation , its great sense of responsibility toward the country and the nation , and its impartial and sincere attitude * The Kuomintang government , on the contrary , saw no gravity in the current situation , entertained an unwarranted optimistic viewpoint , and showed no
inclination to blame itself for bringing the country and the nation to such a critical situation .
During the negotiations the government side was arrogant and assertive in an attempt to put the interest of one party or one faction above that of the nation and to compel others to obey .
Once we look at the government &apos;s proposal of 6 June we will know everything .
The proposal did not mention a single word about the war of resistance ( this deserves our utmost attention ) .
Not a single word touched upon the current difficult and dangerous situation .
There was no hint of any intention on the part of the government to start anew or to abandon the policy that endangered the country .
This proposal wanted to &quot; abolish by a definite date &quot; four @-@ fifths of the armed forces which rendered outstanding meritorious services behind enemy lines and engaged five @-@ sixths of the enemy and puppet troops .
That is to say , this proposal would permit these armed forces to be reorganized into 10 divisions with each division consisting of about 10,000 men , the same number of men for each Kuomintang division .
The total number is 100,000 men .
The other 370,000 regular troops must be &quot; abolished , &quot; and &quot; abolished &quot; quickly Is this not the tone of the Japanese ?
What the Japanese bandits fail to eliminate by all designs and cruel war will be accomplished by the gentlemen of the Kuomintang government through a piece of paper .
If these troops were really abolished , wouldnTt they be awarded by Emperor Hirohito with the highest order of decoration ?
This proposal also wanted the democratic regimes which are elected by the people in ChinaTs liberated areas through democratic methods , closely related by blood and flesh to the people behind enemy lines , sharing happiness and hardships with the people , and resolutely providing leadership in the war of resistance , to be abolished and &quot; to be taken over without exception by officials of the respective local provincial governments . &quot; But where are these so @-@ called &quot; provincial governments ? &quot; Nobody knows what corner of the world they have fled to .
What relationship do they really have with the people and the hard and outstanding struggle of the people .
If one day we find where they are , these high officials of the provincial governments should be given fair treatment ; that is , &quot; dismissal pending investigation and punishment . &quot; In addition , there are many traitors who are hiding in these so @-@ called provincial governments .
Were Pang Ping @-@ hsun &#91; 7894 3521 8133 &#93; and Shih Yu @-@ san &#91; 4258 0645 0005 &#93; , the two thieves who sold out their country , not those provincial governors ?
As to provincial government commissioners , a countless number of them either surrendered to the enemy or rebelled against their own country , In summary , this proposal is favorable only to the Japanese aggressors , reflecting the will of those who pursue their private interest and forget the interest of their country and nation .
This so @-@ called proposal is the crystallization of the despicable will of a small group of fascist elements in the Kuomintang who pursue only the private interest of their own faction without any sense of righteousness for their nation .
This proposal cannot and should not be accepted by any real patriot , because accepting this kind of proposal is tantamount to giving aid to the Japanese aggressors ,
As to the attitude of the two parties during the negotiations , the Communist side has always been earnest , sincere , and compromising , while the Kuomintang side has been arrogant and playing dirty tricks .
Let us talk
about the Letter of Opinion offered by the CCP Central Committee .
The Central Committee cabled Comrade Lin Po @-@ chu on 21 May .
to make a 20 @-@ article proposal .
The proposal was delivered to Chang and Wang .
After reading the proposal , the two said : &quot; The way this is written is not any different from exposing the crimes of the Kuomintang.11 The proposal was rejected .
After learning of the rejection , the Central Committee reduced the proposal to 12 articles and instructed its negotiator to propose the other 8 articles verbally during the negotiations .
On 5 June , Chang and Wang still refused to forward the proposal to the government .
After many days of argument , the proposal was finally transmitted to the government .
From this instance alone one can see that the CCP Central Committee , to show respect for the opinions of the other side , did not mind compromising by reducing the formal articles for the sake of the success of the negotiations .
On the contrary , the government representatives fully showed their rascal @-@ like faces , because transmittal of the opposite side &apos;s opinion to the organization they represent is the minimum duty and obligation of the representatives in any negotiations .
To agree on negotiating and at the same time refuse to transmit the opinion of the opposite side is seldom seen in any negotiations .
We don &apos;t know how to describe this kind of attitude except by calling it &quot; rascal @-@ like &quot; or &quot; scoundrel @-@ like . &quot;
In addition , government representative Chang Chih @-@ chung and Chiang Kai @-@ shek himself declared again and again in the National Assembly : &quot; What the Central Government demands is only unification of military command and political command &quot; ( Chang ) .
&quot; The Central Government has stated repeatedly that we want only unification of military command and unification of political command &quot; ( Chiang ) .
Concerning this point , we announce the following : We resolutely support the unification of political and military command , but political command must represent the people &apos;s will , and military command must be favorable to the war of resistance .
If political command leads the country toward fascist tyranny , and if military command causes defeat in the war of resistance , then patriotic and democratic fighters of China can never obey them , and such commands should never be allowed to be unified .
The Chinese people solemnly despise this kind of counterrevolutionary , rotten tone of unification .
The crucial point is that the Kuomintang government &apos;s political and military commands are exactly this kind of thing ; political command is fascist command , and military command is defeatist command .
To use this kind of political command and military command to unify the country will not only be like &quot; climbing a tree to look for.fishV &quot; but also invite great disaster that would spell death for the nation if unity were really achieved .
Let us not talk about remote things .
Take the events that occurred during the negotiations .
For example , Chiang Ting &gt; -wen &#91; 5592 7844 2429 &#93; , Tang En @-@ po , Hu Tsung @-@ nan &#91; 5170 1350 0589 &#93; and Hsueh Yueh &#91; 5641 1471 &#93; are so @-@ called &quot; loyally obedient &quot; to the political and military commands of the Kuomintang government .
The result is that they are routed without a fight , or routed as soon as they come into contact with the enemy .
They most their troops and territory , played havoc among the ordinary people , and made themselves a world laughingstock .
On the contrary , the 8th Route Army and the New 4th Army , accused by the Kuomintang of &quot; destroying the
unity of military and political commands , &quot; win battles every day and recover territories every day .
Their actions are really beneficial to the unity of the country and the nation .
This kind of clear contrast proves that the political command and military command of the Kuomintang government have no value at all .
Thus , if we want to talk abaut unity of military and political command today , we must thoroughly change the nature of the military and political command .
In order to change the nature of the military command and political command , we must thoroughly change the military , political , economic and cultural policies of the Kuomintang government , thoroughly reorganize the government and the command headquarters and chase out those capitulationists , defeatists , dictators and fascist elements , let those who can really represent the interest of the people control the political and economic commands , and make it possible for them to represent all the strength of the country and the will of the people .
We must do this so that we can avert the present crisis and win the war of resistance .
We must do this so that we can talk about unity of military command and political command .
We must do this so that unity of military command and political command can be beneficial to the country and the nation .
Concerning the reorganization of the present corrupt , incompetent Kuomintang oligarchical and dictatorial government , which has failed to devote its full effort to the war of resistance , Comrade Lin Po @-@ chu mentioned this in his report to the National Assembly .
It was really timely .
Comrade Lin Po @-@ chu &apos;Ts rebuttal of the Kuomintang government &apos;s proposal , contained in his letter to Wang Shih @-@ chieh and Chang Chih @-@ chung dated 30 August , is entirely in conformity with the principles of the war of resistance , unity and democracy .
People in Yenan still hope that Chang and Wang will come to Yenan for an inspection and continued negotiations .
As to the election of five assemblymen by the National Assembly for an inspection trip to Yenan , it is a very good move .
We wish to express our welcome .

YENAN OBSERVER ON THE WAR SITUATION IN CHINA 21 September 1944
&#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY , Yenan , 21 SeptemberThe Yenan observer made the following comments concerning the war situation in China :
Recently the military situation on the two battlefronts in China sharply revealed the true nature of what the Kuomintang authorities call &quot; unity of military command . &quot; On the battlefront entirely under the Kuomintang command , seven cities along the Hunan @-@ Kweichow RailwayChi @-@ yang , Ling @-@ ling , Tung @-@ an , Hsin @-@ ning , Tao @-@ hsien , Tzu @-@ yuan and Ch &apos;uan @-@ hsienall fell to the enemy in 12 days after the enemy in Hunan took Ch &apos;ang @-@ ning , Kweilin on the Hunan @-@ Kweichow Railway and Shao @-@ yang on the flanks are in danger .
Meanwhile , the enemy in Kwangtung , in a two @-@ pronged attack from the Hsi River and Leichou Peninsula , captured six citiesKao @-@ ming , Sze @-@ hui , Chao @-@ ch &apos;ing , K &apos;ai @-@ p &apos;ing , Hsin @-@ hsing and Lien @-@ chiang .
The enemy troops advancing southward from Tao @-@ hsien have reached Chiang @-@ hua and Yung @-@ ming in the southernmost part of Hunan .
The enemy advancing northward from the Hsi River have captured Huai @-@ chi and Hsin @-@ tu in Kwangsi .
The distance between the two lines of enemy advance is less than 120 miles .
This kind of shameful defeat of losing a city a day is the price of the so @-@ called &quot; obedience to military command . &quot; Today , when the Allies are actively making naval preparations to attack the Philippines and the China coast and are actively strengthening the Yunnan @-@ Burma overland transportation line and bombing Japanese @-@ occupied areas and Japan itself from the air , the corrupt and incompetent high command in Chungking is creating dangers for itself and difficulties for the Allied forces , yielding to the Japanese bandits important and strategically advantageous territories , and giving them the opportunity to delay their defeat .
The seriousness of our defeat on the southwestern battlefront is not the size of our losses nor the speed with which we lost our troops and territory , but the consequence of our wrong strategy .
The crisis in Kwangsi may mean that the enemy may knock on the door of Kunming or even of Chungking .
The Allied air force , dreaded most by the Japanese bandits , has lost its important bases because of the fast deterioration of the situation in Hunan and Kwangsi , and it continues to feel that harm done by the poor Kuomintang military command .
If the worst happens , the Japanese
may be able to seize control of the entire east @-@ west communication line across China and cut China in two .
The disadvantage created by this situa ^ tion to our counteroffensive is immeasurable .
In his two speeches in the National Assembly , Chiang Kai @-@ shek did not say a single word about how to turn the tide of the current crisis or how to change the policy and personnel of the high command that created these crises .
All of a sudden he stressed in vain , again and again , the lack of so @-@ called &quot; unity of military command &quot; that hampered our victory in the war of resistance .
One should know that the so @-@ called &quot; unity of military command , &quot; just as National Assemblymen Wang Yun @-@ wu &#91; 3769 7189 0063 &#93; and Hu Lin &#91; 5170 7207 &#93; rightfully said , &quot; is not the problem . &quot; The problem is what kind of military command should we have after the unification .
If we must keep today &apos;s defeatist military command as the unified command , then it seems to me that we will not be satisfied unless all our armies follow the example of those units engaged in the Honan campaign in the past and the present Hunan @-@ Kwangsi campaign , and then we will all perish .
This kind of destructive psychology leads to nothing but giving aid and comfort to the enemy , hindrance to victory and defeat .
Let us take a look at the battlefronts behind the enemy , where the armies are accused by the Kuomintang of being &quot; disobedient to military command . &quot; The situation there is entirely the opposite .
The people &apos;s army on this battlefront won significant victories one after another in August and September .
The 8th Route Army in Shantung took five cities from the second half of August to the first half of September .
These five cities are Li @-@ ching , Lo @-@ ling and Ling @-@ yi at the Yellow River estuary , Wen @-@ teng at the top of the Chiao @-@ tung Peninsula , and Yi @-@ shui in southeastern Shantung .
The battle of Yun- , cheng in southwestern Shantung resulted in the liberation of more than 600 villages and towns .
The countersweep campaign in coastal southeastern Shantung annihilated one brigade of puppet troops under the command of Ch &apos;en San @-@ k &apos;an &#91; 7115 0005 0974 &#93; .
This constitutes a sharp contrast to the sad situation of losing a city a day on the forward battlefront .
Also , there have been many victories along the coast in various provinces .
For example , the 8th Route Army in Hopeh captured Kao @-@ li @-@ ying , 16 miles north of Peiping ; attacked and entered Ch &apos;ing @-@ yun @-@ tien southeast of Peiping and ChTang @-@ hsin @-@ tien southwest of Peiping ; entered the cities of Changchow , Hsiung @-@ hsien and Shen @-@ tze ; and reached the city gates of I @-@ hsien and Hsu @-@ shui .
The New 4th Army , .which has been active in a triangular area bordered by Nanking , Shanghai and Ningpo , captured Lu @-@ lang @-@ ch1iao , 16 miles southwest of Nanking , and Shih @-@ chuang , Chang @-@ huang- ^ -kang , and Hsin @-@ sheng @-@ kang on the north bank of the Yangtze River ; and attacked and entered Changi @-@ haing on the southwest shore of T &apos;ai @-@ ho , Li @-@ shui and Li @-@ yang between Nanking and Chang @-@ hsing and the suburbs of Ningpo .
The Tung @-@ chiang Column in the vicinity of Canton attacked and entered Lung @-@ yen @-@ tung in the suburbs of Canton .
The four victories at Ir @-@ shui , Wen @-@ teng , Yun @-@ cheng and Chang @-@ hsing alone liberated 14,000 square li , or 1,500 square miles of land .
As a result of the continuous victories recently , the total population in China &apos;s liberated areas has increased from 86 million to 90 million .
If the so @-@ called military command is for the purpose of fighting the Japanese
and attaining victory , then the battiefronts behind the enemy are models in executing the orders of the high command in the war of resistance .
If we have to accept the Kuomintang proposal fay abolishing four @-@ fifths of the effective anti @-@ Japanese force and returning to the enemy and their puppets four @-@ fifths of the recovered territory , liberated people , prisoners of war and captured weapons before we can be described as &quot; obedient to military command , &quot; then these so @-@ called military orders are nothing but orders against the national interest and selling out the country issued by the running dogs of His Majesty Emperor Hirohito , The Chinese people will arise to punish these thieves who sell out their country and will never allow them to be free or escape the reach of the law .
In looking at the recent situation on the two battiefronts one can see clearly that the central problem for the forward battlefront is the convening of an urgent conference on national affairs , to be attended by all political parties , all factions , all circles , all army leaders , all people &apos;s organizations , and all local anti @-@ Japanese forces , to abrogate the oligarchical rule of the Kuomintang , to thoroughly reorganize the National Government and the command headquarters , to chase out all thieves who sell out their country , capitulationists , defeatists , dictators and fascist elements and turn them over to the people for punishment , and to let those who represent the interest of the war of resistance and the will of the people control the military command so that we can stop the enemy advance and turn the tide of the dangerous situation .
As to the battlefront behind the enemy , the central problem is to strengthen its armament .
Judging from the fact that the Communist Party is engaging five @-@ sixths of the enemy and puppet troops and is winning battles every day , while the Kuomintang is engaging only one @-@ sixth of the enemy and puppet troops and is losing battles every day , the Chinese Communist Party should receive five @-@ sixths or more of the materiel assistance from the Allies , while the Kuomintang should receive at most one @-@ sixth .
The materiel should not be distributed by the Kuomintang , because it is not qualified to do this any more .
If the government and the command headquarters are not reorganized , then our Allies should even consider whether they should give one @-@ sixth of the materiel to the Kuoruintang , because it is responsible for losing territory and hindering the victory of our Allies .
If one weapon is handed over to the Kuomintang , it will eventually wind up in the hands of the enemy .

UNITED FRONT POLICY ON THE CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL FRONTS
Speech at the Shensi @-@ Kansu @-@ Ninghsia Border Region Cultural @-@ Educational Mass Meeting in October 1944
30 October 1944
&#91; Text &#93; At the Border Region Cultural @-@ Educational Mass Meeting attended by over 1,000 people , Chairman Mao , on 30 October , announced the united front policy of the new democratic cultural movement in the liberated areas .
In his speech he explained the importance of cultural work , the social foundation of China &apos;s new democratic culture , the necessity of a united cultural front , the necessity of the integration of the intellectuals and the worker @-@ peasant masses , and the need and spontaneity of the masses , the two basic principles in work .
Chairman Mao first declared : The general goal of all our work is to smash Japanese imperialism .
Like Hitler , Japanese imperialism will soon perish , but it still has its strength .
The Chinese people , especially those in the liberated areas , must persevere in their effort before we can attain our goal of destroying the enemy .
This effort is manifested primarily in war , next in production and thereafter in culture .
Troops without production are hungry troops ; troops without culture are ignorant troops , and ignorant troops cannot defeat the Japanese bandits , liberate the people and build an industrialized new China .
Therefore , we must have culture .
Some of the comrades once held cultural @-@ educational work in contempt .
It was wrong .
After this meeting , everyone must pay proper attention to cultural @-@ educational work .
Concerning the nature of our culture , Chairman Mao pointed out : It must be the culture of the new democracy , i.e. , the culture of the masses against Japan , the traitors , and the dark feudal tradition .
Its political and economic foundation is a government elected by the people , the reduction of rent and interest , and an individual economy led by plants of all sizes and cooperatives of all types .
While reflecting such a social condition , the new democratic culture promotes its continuous progress .
Chairman Mao stated : China &apos;s industry is still very weak at present , especially in the liberated areas , but its future is without limit .
China must overcome its own backwardness on this foundation , The economy of the liberated areas has its progressive and backward aspects , and it is the same with their culture .
The liberated areas have.a new culture serving as the guide to the masses , but there is also an extensive backward feudal heritage , such as the more than 1 million illerates and the 2,000 sorcerers In the Shensi @-@ Kansu @-@ Ninghsia Border Region .
Feudal superstition still influences the Border RegionTs masses in all aspects of their cultural life .
It seems to be more difficult to resist the enemy inside people &apos;s minds than to fight Japanese imperialism .
The tasks of the Border Region Cultural @-@ Educational Mass Meeting , whether in education , hygiene or news reporting , are to tell th 1.5 million people in the Border Region to rise and struggle against their own customs and habits , such as feudalism , superstition , illiteracy and lack of hygiene .
To wage this difficult struggle we must have an extensive united front .
In education , for instance , we must have not only relatively centralized and regular middle and elementary schools , but also generally dispersed and relatively irregular rural schools and newspaper reading and literacy classes ; we must not only have schools run by the people with a new content , but also utilize and reform the old village schools .
In art , we must have not only modern vernacular plays , but also Yangko dances and rice ^ -transplanting songs ; we must not only have new Yangko dances and rice @-@ transplanting songs , but also utilize and reform the old performing troupes , and especially 90 percent of the old rice @-@ transplanting songs .
It is even more so when it comes to medicine .
In the Shensi @-@ Kansu @-@ Ninghsia Border Region at the present time , the infant mortality rate is as high as 60 percent and the adult mortality rate 3 percent .
Last year , 7S800 cattle , 4,000 donkeys , 210,000 sheep and 2,300 mules died .
The people fairly generally believe in sorcery .
In such a situation , to rely only on the few Western medical doctors in the organizations and the army is impossible .
It is very important to serve the organizations and the troops , and the Western physicians are more scientific than the Chinese .
However , if the Western physicians , in this situation , feel no concern for the people , fail to train more Western doctors for the people in the Border Region , or make no effort to associate with and help reform the 1,000 Chinese doctors and old ^ -type veterinarians in the Border Region , it will be equivalent to aiding the sorcerers and hastening the deaths of the people and the animals .
Therefore , a united front of the new and the old is completely necessary .
The two principles of the united front are completely applicable here ; First is unity ; second is criticism , or , educational reform .
The old pattern of !
capitulation is erroneous , and so are rejection and scorn .
Our task is to collect all usable old patterns and to rally the old @-@ type people and help , influence and reform them .
To reform them we must first unite with them , and , if we do it properly , they will welcome our help and reform .
Our culture is a mass culture .
Therefore , our cultural workers in whatever aspect must be highly devoted to serving the people .
On this point , Chairman Mao sincerely hopes that all the intellectuals will discard their undesirable habit of divorcing themselves from the people and will dedicate
themselves to the people and closely associate with the worker @-@ peasant @-@ soldier masses , while the worker @-@ peasant cadres must respect and trust such revolutionary intellectuals .
Concerning the work style of associating with the masses , Chairman Mao , at the conclusion of his speech , specifically pointed out two basic principles : The needs and the spontaneity of the masses .
We start from the practical needs of the masses , not from any individual &apos;s good intentions or historical dogma .
We must act according to the time and the place .
For instance , the guiding principles of the Shensi @-@ Kansu @-@ Ninghsia Border Region and the liberated areas are identical , but , if the concrete methods suitable in the Border Region are not suitable for other liberated areas , which are directly under a wartime environment or where the population is more dense and the culture more advanced , then they should not be forcefully introduced , and methods suitable to the local conditions should be adopted .
Or , if the masses have the objective need but not the subjective awareness , the leaders and work personnel must wait patiently until their own work has made the masses acquire the awareness and the spontaneity to proceed ; they must never resort to coercion and orders .
In all work requiring participation of the masses , without their awareness and spontaneity it will degenerate into formalism and fail .
&quot; Haste misses the target . &quot; It is so with all work , and it is even more so when it comes to cultural @-@ educational work to reform mass thinking .
In his speech Chairman Mao pointed out that the united cultural @-@ educational front must pay serious attention to cultural @-@ educational work , the integration of the intellectuals and the worker @-@ peasant @-@ soldier masses , and the principle of need and spontaneity .
As he appropriately solved the several crucial issues in the Border Region &apos;s cultural @-@ educational work , his statement won the serious attention of the delegates to the meeting , especially the cadres .
The further development of the united cultural front in the Border Region and the cultivation of the correct workstyle in cultural work will be a response to this speech .

YENAN AUTHORITIES COMMENT ON KUOMINTANG PARTY AND GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL RESHUFFLE
22 November 1944
&#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGEHCY , Yenan , 22 NovemberAuthorities here commented on the partial reshuffle of party and government personnel by the Kuomintang Central :
After the fall of Kweilin and Liuchou , the Japanese bandits continued to sneak up on the Yunnan border , and the military crisis on the forward battle @-@ front mounted , while the political and economic crises also intensified with the military setbacks .
Public opinion among the broad masses within the country and among , our Allies constantly criticized severely the erroneous policies of the Kuomintang and unanimously demanded a complete reorganization of the government and the high command and the formation of a coalition government and a coalition high command to include all resist @-@ Japan parties and factions and troops as a starting point to save the dangerous situation , reinforce the resistance war , and strive for victory .
The partial personnel reshuffle by the Kuomintang authorities this time was a reflection of the aggravation of the crisis of its regime .
Today the Kuoraintang authorities could not but consider the anger of the people throughout the nation and the censure of public opinion of the allied nations , and they replaced Ho Ying @-@ ch &apos;in , K &apos;ung Hsiang @-@ hsi , and Ch &apos;en Li @-@ fu , the targets of public attack , in order to allay the criticism from all sides .
Nevertheless , when the situation is so critical , the Kuomintang authorities still cannot decide on a thorough reform , but wish to maintain the oligarchy of one @-@ party dictatorship .
Therefore , the reshuffle can only be superficial , not thorough , and it can only serve as a temporary measure of appeasement .
Though stripped of their functions as the ministers of military administration , finance and education , Ho , K &apos;ung and Ch &apos;en still occupy crucial positions in the Kuomintang central party , government and military structures : Ho Ying @-@ chrin remains as chief of staff of the high command and holds great power over the army ; K &apos;ung Hsiang @-@ hsi still serves as assistant chief of the Executive Yuan , and his influence on the finance ministry persists ; ChTen Li @-@ fu has been transferred to serve as minister of the Kuomintang Central Organization Ministry and retains his control over the gigantic party affairs structure
of the Kuomintang .
Their successors are still limited to the rightwing clique of the Kuomintang , Not only has no one from any party or faction other than the Kuomintang joined the government , but even the more liberal elements in the party , such as Sun K &apos;o and Sung Tzu @-@ wen , have not increased their influence in the government .
Thus , the personnel reshuffle was merely a shifting of functions within the ruling clique of the Kuomintang , and it will not truly help overcome the current serious crises .
There is only one way to overcome the ever aggravating military , political , financial and economic crises , strengthen the resistance war and attain victory , and it is by thoroughly reorganizing the government and the high command as long advocated by the Chinese Communist Party and the people of China , purging all antidemocratic elements , defeatists and fascists , recruiting those who can truly represent the people &apos;s interests from the various parties and factions and the military units , organizing a coalition government and a coalition high command , and thoroughly changing the government policies in all aspects .
Only thus will the crises in the rear be averted .
However , it is regrettable that the Kuomintang authorities have not reached a decision even today .
Apparently , the government personnel reshuffle &apos; this time is still 100,000 11 away from the demand of the people of the entire nation .
If the Kuomintang authorities continue to procrastinate and refuse to follow the correct path pointed out by the people , then the crises will only intensify day by day until they become irremediable .
It is a very clear tendency .
Either permitting the crises to develop to an irremediable stage or thoroughly changing the erroneous policies are the two directions confronting the Kuomintang , and the choice is up to it .

TASKS FOR 1945
Speech to the Shensi @-@ Kansu @-@ Ninghsia Border Region Advisory Council on 15 December 1944
&#91; Text &#93; The year 1944 will soon draw to a close .
What are our tasks in 1945 ?
What items of work require our special attention next year ?
The entire antifascist war has been very successful , and the defeat of Hitler will be realized next year .
Our only task is to coordinate with our Allies to smash the Japanese aggressors .
Currently , America has taken Leyte Island and may land in China .
Meanwhile , the Japanese aggressors have opened mainland communication lines between Tokyo and Singapore , and China has lost more territory .
Will the enemy cease his attack ?
I feel that he will not .
He may mount an offensive again in southwest and northwest China .
During this period the Japanese aggressors will inevitably again resort to tricks in attempts to induce the Chinese Government to surrender through China &apos;s capitulationists .
China &apos;s internal situation is still one of disunity , and there have been no results in the negotiations between the Kuomintatig and the Communist Party .
The war on the forward battlefront has been lost at every point , while the Kuomintang authorities persist in their one @-@ party dictatorship and defeatist policy , over which the people of the entire nation have long felt dissatisfied , and they refuse all suggestions favorable to the resistance war , unity and democracy .
Only in the arduously won broad liberated areas are Mr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s three revolutionary principles of democracy , i.e. , the new democracy , implemented , the people of all fields united , courageous troops trained , all enemy onslaughts smashed and large areas of lost territory recovered by our offensives .
In this situation , what must we do ?
We must make the people of the whole nation understand that , only by using the strength of the people and urging the Kuomintang , the Communist Party , other anti @-@ Japanese parties and factions , and those without party or factional affiliations to hold a national affairs conference on a democratic basis and organize a coalition government will we unite all resist @-@ Japan forces in China against the attack of the Japanese aggressors and , in coordination with our Allies , expel them from China .
This issue was proposed to the People &apos;s Political Council through Comrade Lin Tsu @-@ han .
and
subsequently made in writing to the Kuomintang authorities , and recently Comrade Chou EnTlai made a trip to Chungking specifically for this matter , but there have been no results .
At the present time it is very clear that negotiations alone will not succeed .
In order to form a democratic coalition government promptly , we hope that the people of the entire nation will rise unanimously , shout in desperation , and demand that the Kuomintang authorities change their current policy .
This is the general task of the people of the entire nation .
Whether in the rear , the enemy occupied areas , or the liberated areas , the people of China must all fight for this goal .
When a coalition central government which is able to truly implement a democratic policy and mobilize and unite all the resist @-@ Japan strength in China appears , the victory of China &apos;s resistance war and the liberation of the Chinese people will be rapidly realized .
For this goal , all of us must think of many means .
In the rear we must support the democratic patriotic movement suppressed by the reactionary authorities , mobilize all strength against enemy attacks , and guard against the conspiratorial activities of the capitulatlonists who desert the nation and surrender to the enemy .
Among the young people and those in all fields , many must go to enemy @-@ occupied areas to fight guerrilla warfare , and the broad masses must be prepared to resist in all areas where the enemy may appear .
Meanwhile , by their own courageous combat actions and by launching new.regional guerrilla warfare , the liberated areas will effectively render support to the rear .
All the people and all the patriotic parties and factions in the rear have the obligation to strive for a democratic coalition .
There are many parties and factions , industrialists , professors , students and even many Kuomintang members who support the proposal for a coalition government , finding it the only correct path to resist Japan and save the nation at the present time .
However , their strength is still inadequate , and we must appeal to the broad masses to rise and struggle for this goal .
In the occupied areas the broad masses suffer the enemy &apos;s cruel oppression and yearn for liberation .
We must help them organize so that they will be ready to stage armed uprisings when the time is ripe and , in coordination with military attacks from the outside , expel the Japanese aggressors and liberate our brothers and sisters .
This task must be placed in a position of equal importance with the work of the liberated areas .
It is an extremely urgent task and must be performed regardless of the difficulties .
In this work the French Communist Party and the French people serve as our bright models , and we must learn from their experiences .
Among the people in the occupied areas we must explain the necessity of a democratic coalition government so that they will know that , once such a government appears , their liberation is near , and we must appeal to them to rise and struggle for this goal .
The liberated areas have become the center for resisting Japan and saving the nation .
By the end of November 1944 we had here 650,000 men of the 8th Route Army , the New 4th Army and other people &apos;s resist @-@ Japan troops ,
over 2 million militia , and 90 million liberated people .
In 1944 we made great achievements in military affairs , politics , economy and culture .
What are the tasks in 1945 requiring our special attention ?
I feel that in 1945 China &apos;s liberated areas must give attention to the following :
( 1 ) The liberated areas must be expanded .
In the vicinity of , or further away from , any liberated areas there are many places occupied by the enemy or puppet troops where the defense is weak .
Our troops must attack such places , wipe out the enemy or puppet troops , expand the liberated area , and reduce the enemy @-@ occupied area .
We must turn into liberated areas all enemy @-@ occupied areas where the defense is weak and which can be taken by us under the existing conditions , forcing the enemy into the extremely narrow confines of the cities and main communication lines , tightly surrounding it , and completely expelling it when the conditions on all sides are ripe .
Such attacks are completely necessary and feasible .
Our troops have launched many such attacks , especially the great achievements this year , and we must continue to do the same next year .
In all areas newly occupied by the enemy where no liberated area has been established , such as Honan , we must appeal to the people to organize armed ranks , resist the aggressors , and establish new liberated areas .
As proven by our experience of the past several years , organizing large numbers of well @-@ trained &quot; armed work teams &quot; capable of performing military and political tasks , penetrating the enemy line to launch surprise attacks on the enemy and puppet troops , organizing the people , and coordinating with the fighting on the front of the liberated areas are most effective , and all areas must follow suit .
( 2 ) Enemy attacks will never cease , and we must be constantly vigilant and be prepared to smash them .
The absence of such vigilance is incorrect .
We must not feel that we have become strong and the enemy weak and that the comparative situation between the enemy and ourselves has changed .
We must realize that the enemy is still strong ; it will never forget to attack us .
We are still weaker than the enemy , and we must make a great effort and follow the correct military and other policies before we can change the situation .
Not until we occupy a position of superiority will enemy attack become impossible ,
( 3 ) We must train the existing self @-@ defense army and militia and increase their combat power .
The numbers of the self @-@ defense army and the militia are still inadequate , Except in certain individual areas where it is impossible , all areas must expand their numbers as much as possible .
Among the 90 million people , except for the old , the very young , and the sick , all citizens , men and women , must be organized into the self @-@ defense army and , under the principle of not disengaging from production , take turns performing the tasks of defending their homeland and assisting the troops .
The able @-@ bodied in the self @-@ defense army must be selected to organize the militia or basic self @-@ defense army and , under the principles of &quot; integrating combat and production , &quot; either assist the troops or take independent actions .
Among the 90 million people there must be at least 5 percent , i.e .. , 4,5 million , serving in the militia .
In other words , the current number of militia must be doubled .
Some areas have not given serious attention to this work .
In these areas the militia is too small in number , short of training and inferior in quality .
This situation must be changed in 1945 .
The self @-@ defense army and the militia must not miss the farming seasons , absence from work must be reduced , and production must not be hampered .
Here the labor exchange method is necessary .
The fighting militia organization and the productive labor exchange can often be combined .
The leadership organs of the self @-@ defense army and the militia must be democratically elected .
Only thus will we be able to expand the self @-@ defense army and the militia and raise their combat power .
The major means of combat of the militia is the land mine , and the land -mine movement must be popularized in all rural villages .
The manufacture of all types of land mines and training in the technique of detonation are critical .
( 4 ) We must retrain the regular troops and the guerrillas .
In 1945 all the troops must be retrained once by rotation .
We must retrain them according to the new method and hold mass maneuvers ,
( 5 ) In the old areas the gaps in the ranks of existing troops must be refilled .
In the newly developed areas , where economic conditions permit , the troops must &apos;be expanded .
Whether replacement or expansion , it must be predicated on not increasing the people &apos;s burden .
This point must be kept in mind .
If it is violated , we will fail .
( 6 ) The internal unity of the troops is extremely important .
Our 8th Route Army and New 4th Army have always relied on the harmony between the officers and the soldiers for their glorious successes .
However , the influence of warlordism in China &apos;s warlord troops still exists in our army , and it is quite serious in some units .
In 1945 we must perform extensive work and fundamentally eliminate all the undesirable habits and erroneous policies in the relationship between officers and soldiers , such as beatings , scoldings , indifference to the rations , illness , and other difficulties of the soldiers , imposing punishments lightly , and even insults or executing deserters .
Many units are still not paying serious attention to this work , because they do not understand that It is an extremely Important political foundation of the combat power of the troops .
In the annual training program @-@ starting at present , military and political training must be equally stressed , and the two must be combined .
At the beginning of training the political aspect must be stressed , Improving the relationships between officers and soldiers , Increasing internal unity , and activating the advanced positivity of the cadre and soldier masses .
Only then will military training become more easily carried out and more effective .
In the performance of this work , the movement to support the cadres and cherish the soldiers must be launched in every unit , appealing to the cadres to cherish the soldiers while appealing to the soldiers to support the cadres , and openly discussing and promptly rectifying the defects and -mistakes of both sides .
In this way the goal of internal unity will be reached .
( 7 ) We must strengthen our work in supporting the government and cherishing the people and in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to the families of resistance war soldiers , and further improve military ^ -civilian relations .
Our 8th Route Army and New 4th Army have always maintained a good relationship with the people ; therefore , we have been able to defeat the enemy and consolidate and develop the liberated areas .
Nevertheless , the bad habits of the old troops can contaminate us , and undesirable manifestations in military @-@ civilian relations , such as arrogance , damaging the people &apos;s interest , lack of discipline , and lack of respect for the government , often occur .
Meanwhile , such defects as inadequate help to the troops by the locality and lack of success in the work of rendering preferential treatment to the families of resistance war soldiers also exist .
We pointed out the importance of such tasks in 1943 , but many areas have not given serious attention to them .
In areas where achievements have been made , they must continue their effort and examine the results of these two aspects of work .
If the officers and soldiers in all our units become united as one and reach an ironclad consolidation politically , with military technique and tactical training and the people &apos;s support added thereto , the cause of the Chinese people to resist Japan and save the nation will have a firm guarantee .
( 8 ) The national united front is the fundamental line for the Chinese people to resist Japan and save the nation .
In the liberated areas it is manifested primarily in government work under the three @-@ thirds system whereby all classes and all parties and factions cooperate .
Some areas have performed this successfully while others have not .
All areas must summarize their experiences .
Communist Party members must hold more discussions , forums and meetings with other parties and factions and those without party or factional affiliations in order to eliminate the lack of contact and the misunderstandings , correct the undesirable situation in their mutual relations , and together perform government work and all social undertakings .
All personnel participating in the work of the People &apos;s Council ( .Consultative Council ) , in government , and in social work , regardless of their parties or factions or the absence of party or factional affiliations , must be respected , and they must all be given responsibility and authority .
( 9 ) All areas have made achievements in rent reduction .
However , the achievements of some areas are smaller , and such defects as reduction in name only and .
favoritism still exist .
On the other hand , the reduction in some areas is excessive , or no attention is given to rent payment after reduction .
Both extremes must be corrected .
Upon the expiration of the lease after rent reduction , except where the landlord may repossess his land and farm it himself under the principle of considering the interests of both sides , the lease must be renewed so that the peasants will have land to cultivate .
In the old areas where rent reduction is not thorough , investigations must be carried out .
In the new areas where the rent has not been reduced , the reduction must be launched .
It is incorrect not to reduce the rent , but excessive reduction is also incorrect .
Where
landlords are in financial difficulty due to enemy destruction or other factors , the government must help them solve their difficulties and give them the opportunity to do agricultural , industrial , commercial or other work .
This must be considered an item of government work in order to rally them against our common enemy .
We are now located in the rural areas , and the correct solution of the land issue is a crucial link in enduring a long @-@ term war .
We hope everyone .will pay attention to it .
( 10 ) The overwhelming majority of the areas have launched the production movement this year and achieved obvious results , It is an extremely encouraging major undertaking .
Nevertheless , some areas have not started , others have not made great progress , and , in still other areas , the troops have been successful while the people have not .
In 1945 we must generally launch large @-@ scale production without exception .
All troops , besides their combat and training duties , must produce to supply themselves , and this also applies to organizations and schools .
Only under exceptional situations will reduction of or exemption from production be permitted .
We must mobilize the people and , under the principle of spontaneity , organize production mutual help organizations , such as labor exchange teams , -mutual help teams , and labor exchange classes .
Our local work personnel must devote great energy to helping the people and organising such mutual help organizations in order to resume and develop production on a large scale , enabling the people to have not only sufficient @-@ clothing and food but also a surplus .
The slogan of &quot; one @-@ quarter surplus , &quot; except in areas suffering from severe enemy destruction , can Be realized even in the liberated areas behind enemy lines .
We must strive for self @-@ sufficiency in the industrial products of our liberated areas , and we must seek to attain the goal of self @-@ sufficiency in whole or in the greater part within the next few years .
Through the efforts of state , private and cooperative enterprises it is possible to reach this goal .
Thrift complements production , and we must reduce waste as much as possible .
&quot; Developing the economy ; assuring the supply &quot; is our immutable fiscal policy , If we do not fundamentally develop the economy , but only dwell on the secondary issues , it will be wrong .
If we devote our efforts to the development of the public and private economy , we will be able to endure in the war regardless of its length , and our energy will not be exhausted .
This point is extremely important , and all work personnel and the entire army and people must understand it clearly in order to organize a large @-@ scale production tnovemetlt .
In the public economy the individual bonus system according to quality and level may be introduced in many units , and the principles of &quot; consideration of both the military and the civilian &quot; and &quot; consideration of both the public and the private &quot; must be observed .
( 11 ) To defeat the Japanese aggressors , besides giving full attention to military affairs , politics , and the economy , we must also stress cultural and educational work .
The absolute majority of the intellectuals in our liberated areas are good .
Their defects , and even their mistakes , can be rectified in work .
They are valuable assets in the people &apos;s cause and must be given serious attention .
Many of them are engaged in military ,
political and economic work , while many others perform cultural , educational , art and hygienic tasks .
All of them must receive serious attention , The direction pointed out at the Shensi ^ Kansu @-@ Ninghsia Border Region Cultural @-@ Educatios Work .
Conference this year is applicable in the various areas .
The absolutists benefit from the people &apos;s ignorance , but we benefit from their intelligence .
We must gradually lead all the people out of their ignorant and unhygienic situation .
The governments and party organizations of all areas must place newspapers , schools , the arts and hygiene , the four items of cultural @-@ educational work , on their daily agenda .
( 12 ) By means of .
mass democratic election , the superior elements among the troops , rural villages , plants and government organs must be chosen to serve as combat heroes , labor heroes and -model workers and given awards and training , thereby encouraging and rallying the broad masses .
As proven by the experiences of the past several years , this system is most effective in raising the combat power of the troops , increasing the production strength in agriculture and industry , and improving the efficiency of the government and all other organs .
All areas must generally launch this movement .
( 13 ) To defeat the Japanese aggressors we need large numbers of able cadres .
Our current cadre ranks have been greatly increased compared with before , but they still are insufficient , Their ability has been improved but still is not adequate .
This is especially true with the lower @-@ level and basic @-@ level cadres .
Whether army or local cadres , their cultural level , comprehension of policies , and work ability are generally not high , while some of them are very low .
The reason for this situation is that , too busy in their work , they have little opportunity to receive education .
In 1945 all areas , in conducting cadre education , must stress the training of army ( from company to squad ) and local ( district , township ) low @-@ level and basic @-@ level cadres , using the rotational method in regard to those working and the school method in regard to those not working and systematically improving them .
( 14 ) One major shortcoming in our workstyle is the habit of some personnel of making decisions and carrying them out on their own , their lack of skill in inducing the people to criticize and discuss , and their lack of the democratic workstyle .
Naturally , we are comparing the different workstyles in the liberated areas , not those between our liberated and the Kuoinintang areas .
Ours are democratic areas , while those under the Kuomintang are feudal ones , and a fundamental distinction exists between the two .
Nevertheless , many in our ranks have not learned the democratic workstyle , and the bureau ^ cratic style from the old society still exists .
Wo one may express a different opinion , and one is displeased over any dissent .
One only likes to hear flattery , not criticism .
For fear of being snubbed , attacked or retaliated against , others do not have the courage to express their opinions .
This is a very undesirable workstyle .
It blocks the progress of our cause and the improvement of the work personnel .
I suggest that all areas conduct education on this point , vigorously promoting the democratic workstyle inside and outside the party .
Regardless of who they are , as long as they are not hostile elements and do not launch malicious attacks , everyone must
be permitted to speak , and it does not matter eyen if they say the wrong things .
The leading personnel of all leyels have the duty to listen to what others have to say .
Two principles must be followed ; ( i ) One must say what one knows ; one must say all ; ( .ii ) the one who speaks is blameless ; the one who listens must take heed .
Without &quot; the blamelessness of the one who speaks , &quot; and it being truly so , it will be impossible to produce the effect of &quot; saying what one knows and saying all , &quot; Ever since the conduct rectification movement our workstyle has greatly improved , and it has won the approval of all good people .
It is very glorious .
But we still have a serious defect .
Many of us still lack the democratic workstyle , and we must correct it .
All our work cadres , regardless of their high or low positions , are the people &apos;s orderlies , and everything we do is to serve the people .
So , what are the -undesirable things in us which we hesitate to discard ?
If we correct this defect , we will rally the people even more extensively , and our cause will show a greater and faster development ,
( 15 ) Besides what has been enumerated above , one extremely important task before the people of the liberated areas is to devise all kinds of means to promote a coalition government .
Continuing our negotiations with the Kuomintang and other parties and factions is one means , appeal by the people of the entire nation is another , but there may be other means , too .
In sum . , we must strive from all sides to form , as promptly as possible , a democratic coalition government compatible with the demands of the national resistance war .
Naturally , there is still much more work which our liberated areas have performed or must perform , but I feel that the above 15 items are what require our specia.l attention at the present time , and I have omitted the rest .
As the conditions and steps of the various liberated areas are different on many points , all areas must arrange the work according to their own particular situation in order to complete the tasks appropriately .
The year 1945 must be one of a greater development of the Chinese people &apos;s resistance war .
The people of the entire nation hope that our liberated areas will save China , and we also have such , determination and courage .
I hope that all the soldiers and people of our liberated areas will strive together , rally all the Communist Party members and nomnembers , and struggle to reinforce the resist @-@ Japan work of the liberated areas , organize the people of the enemy @-@ occupied areas , render aid to the people of our rear , and form a democratic coalition government .

NEW YEAR MESSAGESTRIVE FOR EARLY VICTORY 1 January 1945
&#91; Text &#93; The year 1944 has passed .
It was a year of decisive changes in the antifascist war .
On the European front there were the following brilliant accomplishments : The complete recovery of Soviet territory , the opening of a second front in Western Europe by the Allies , the surrender of the dependent Axis &#91; countries &#93; of Finland , Bulgaria and Romania * the tremendous growth of the people &apos;s liberation movement in France , Belgium , Yugoslavia , Greece and Poland , and the liberation of their territories in whole or in greater part .
In 1944 the strategic plan to surround and attack the German bandits from the east , west and south was completed , and the war is currently being fought on the borders of the Nazi imperialists .
Soviet artillery is shelling the defenses of East Prussia , while the great armies of America and England are attacking the western wall of the German bandits , Regardless of how desperately the German bandits struggle , or even attempt a partial counteroffensive , Hitler is destined to lose the war .
All the struggles of the German bandits will only prolong the war for a certain period , and it is impossible for them to resist the final joint offensive of the Allies in 1945 .
The year 1945 will be the year of Nazi Germany &apos;s final destruction .
In the Pacific , the American forces launched a large @-@ scale offensive against the Japanese bandits in 1944 , successively broke through their internal and external defense lines , from the Marshalls , New Guinea , via the Marianas and Borneo to the Philippines , and placed Japan proper &apos; .under the strategic bombing of the U.S.
Air Force , In the past year the Japanese bandits lost much territory and men in the ocean and were placed on the defensive completely .
However , they still maintain their main naval force ; their army has not suffered any major loss , and it even made tremendous progress on the Chinese Kuomintang front .
Therefore , the Far East front in 1945 will see .
even more cruel battles than in 1944 .
The speed of the victory of the war in the Far East will depend to a large extent on China &apos;s war effort and on the joint counteroffensive of the Allies on land and sea in the Far East .
To increase China &apos;s war effort and to prepare and carry out the counteroffensive on China &apos;s battlefront , we must overcome the military , political and economic crises created by the fascist
187and defeatist policies of the Kuomintang authorities .
The only way to overcome such crises is by abolishing the corrupt one @-@ party dictatorship of the Kuomintang , reorganizing the National Government and the high command , and forming a coalition government and a coalition high command .
The year 1944 was a year of tremendous changes on the battlefront of China .
The period of 1939 to April 1944 , stretching over 5 years and 4 months , constituted a stage in China &apos;s battlefront .
During this stage the Japanese bandits ceased their frontal attacks and concentrated on the liberated areas behind their lines .
The Kuomintang rulers were superficial in their resistance war effort but extremely active in resisting the communists and the people .
Therefore , the soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas behind enemy lines were placed in an extremely difficult situation , burdened with the entire responsibility of persevering in the resistance war on China &apos;s battlefront .
During this period of 5 @-@ odd years it was commonplace for the cities and villages in the liberated areas behind enemy lines to undergo more than 10 burnings and massacres by the enemy bandits ; the outlying areas suffered such burnings and massacres 60 or 70 times .
Under such unheard @-@ of severe destruction , the people7s savings were completely wiped out , yet , as a result of the 10 great policies of the Chinese Communist Central , their unity became even more consolidated , and they became even more tenacious in fighting .
From the second half of 1942 on , the liberated areas , far from diminishing , became ever more expanded .
We defeated Neiji Okamura , smashed the three anticommunist campaigns launched by the reactionaries in the Kuomintang , and created rare miracles in history .
On the Kuomintang battlefront , the enemy did not launch any major offensive in 5 1 / 2 years , and the Kuomintang troops adopted the policy of passive avoidance , withdrawing upon the approach of the enemy , losing all morale , and collapsing on sight of the enemy .
Meanwhile , in the rear under Kuomintang control , it was tyranny and dictatorship , corruption and lawlessness .
The party , government , soldiers and people were disunited , and the bureaucratic structure became intolerably corrupt .
The Japanese bandits regarded the Chinese people as &quot; ferocious tigers &quot; and the Kuomintang government as the &quot; tiger cage , &quot; and they even declared that they &quot; did not consider the Chungking army an enemy . &quot; Nevertheless , since April last year , due to the unfavorable situation created by the Pacific counteroffensive of the U.S.
forces , besides maintaining a gigantic military force in its rear , the enemy was forced to attack the &quot; tiger cage &quot; which was &quot; not considered an enemy &quot; with a part of its force in order to open up mainland communication lines and oust the air bases of the U.S.
forces .
Since the Japanese bandits resumed their offensive against the Kuomintang &apos;s front in April last year , the Kuomintang troops disintegrated on contact .
Honan , Hunan and Kwangsi fell one after another , and the Japanese bandits attained their goal of opening the mainland communication lines in less than 6 months .
Yet , during the same period , China &apos;s liberated areas won victories at every point and liberated 80,000 square kilometers of territory and 12 million countrymen .
The changes on ChinaTs battlefront in the past year clearly reflected the contrast between two kinds of policies , two lines and two sets of methods : The policy of negative resistance , waiting for victory ,
conserving strength , and rejecting the dissenters led to collapse and crisis , while the policy of positive resistance under the new democracy channeled the resistance war to tremendous victories .
The military failure resulting from the erroneous policies of the Kuomintang placed the battlefront in a grave situation .
If it continues to permit the Japanese bandits to penetrate the national territory , then they will be able to relatively and temporarily avert their decline , prolong the war and increase the misery and sacrifice of the Chinese people and those of the Allies .
Refusing to admit this point , or failing to stress its gravity , is irresponsibility toward the people of China and our Allies .
In fact , the collapse of the Kuomintang battlefront has already helped the Japanese bandits to more or less avert their strategic decline , prolonged the war and increased the misery and sacrifice of the people .
This responsibility must be borne by the reactionaries in the Kuomintang .
In this situation , the task of our countrymen in the entire nation is , on the one hand , to launch counterattacks wherever possible and prepare for them wherever they are called for and , on the other hand , to block the enemy bandits from advancing toward our rear .
Our work , in Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung &apos;s &quot; Tasks for 1945 , &quot; has been summarized in four slogans : &quot; Reinforce the resistance work of the liberated areas , &quot; &quot; Organize the people of the enemy @-@ occupied areas , &quot; &quot; Render aid to the people of our rear , &quot; and &quot; Form a democratic coalition government . &quot;
Among the four slogans , the most crucial one is to form a democratic coalition government .
It is a task requiring the unanimous efforts of the Chinese people in three different situations ( liberated areas , our rear and the enemy @-@ occupied areas ) , because , as clearly indicated by our experiences in 1944 , if we do not thoroughly abolish the erroneous policies of the Kuomintang rulers and adopt new military , political , economic and cultural policies commensurate with the resistance war , democracy , and unity , and if we do not oust the defeatist and fascist elements and corrupt .
officials in the government and the local tyrants and undesirable gentry and replace them with new figures capable of representing the people &apos;s will and strength and of leading China toward victory and freedom , then it will be impossible to stop the Japanese bandits from continuous penetration , let alone coordinate with our Allies to carry out a joint land and sea offensive on the Far East battlefront .
Only a democratic coalition government will avert the crisis on China &apos;s forward battlefront ; only such a government will shorten the war and attain an early victory !
Today the resistance war has entered its 9th year .
In these long months and years our countrymen of the entire nation have tasted all the miseries caused by the war , and we eagerly hope for an early victory .
Meanwhile , the Japanese bandits favor a prolonged war , and the reactionaries inside the Kuomintang help them postpone ChinaTs victory with their erroneous policies and intensify the suffering of the people .
On this New Year &apos;s Day
we hope that our countrymen of the entire nation will , with a solemn attitude and concrete work , strive for the early victory of the resistance war , We must especially seek the realization of the prerequisite of victory a democratic coalition government .

YENAN AUTHORITIES ON CHIANG KAI @-@ SHEK &apos;S NEW YEAR RADIO SPEECH 3 January 1945
&#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY , Yenan , 3 JanuaryYenan authorities published their comment on Chaing Kai @-@ shek &apos;s New Year radio speech :
When the people refused to support you and your foundation became shaky , you made the empty promise of a people &apos;s congress time and time again to hoodwink the people .
There were definite dates in the past , but now there is none , and not even confidence in the victory of the resistance war .
How should you be indicted ?
Let us analyze your words .
If a people &apos;s congress is convened during the resistance war period , will it be a &quot; people &apos;s congress &quot; consisting of members who were elected by bribery before the war and most of whom followed renegade Wang after the start of the war , or will there be a new election ?
If the former , who will want that dead , foul and rotten &quot; people &apos;s congress ? &quot; If the latter , how will it be elected ?
Who will carry out the election law ?
Who will supervise it ?
If the oligarchic dictatorship is not first eliminated , the current Kuomintang government thoroughly reorganized , replacing it with a democratic coalition government , and the secret service organ disbanded , giving the people freedom of speech , meeting and association , will there be a congress elected by the people ?
Yuan Shih @-@ k &apos;ai once held a Hung @-@ hsien congress , and Ts &apos;ao K &apos;un called a piglet congress .
Will there be a tyrant and public enemy today with the nerve to call a Chiang &apos;s people &apos;s congress , or a piglet people &apos;s congress ?
Exposing Chiang &apos;s shameless fraud in calling a people &apos;s congress , the Yenan authorities concluded : To resist the prompt formation of a coalition government desired by the people of the whole nation , Chiang held out a shield .
Yet the so @-@ called &quot; people &apos;s congress &quot; of Chiang and his clique has long been notorious .
If left unmentioned , maybe no one will notice it , but every time it is mentioned its stench permeates the air .
Mencius said : &quot; When Hsi @-@ tzu became soiled , everyone covered his nose when passing . &quot; Hsi @-@ tzu was a beauty , yet , when soiled , everyone covered his nose .
When a lone tyrant is soaked in the manure vat , how can one tell the Chinese people not to cover their nose and run ?
If you do not want the people to cover their nose , the only way is to wash off the manure .

YENAN AUTHORITIES REFUTE WEI TAO @-@ MING &apos;S LIES 4 February 1945
&#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY , Yenan , 4 FebruaryYenan authorities commented on the statement of Wei Tao @-@ ming , Kuomintang ambassador to the United States , at a Washington press conference on 2 February .
The comment is as follows :
WeiTs statement on the distribution of lend @-@ lease resources consisted of rumors and lies .
He said : &quot; Amotig the lend @-@ lease supplies shipped to the Central Government for use against Japan , a considerably large portion has been distributed to the Communist Party for use in the same cause . &quot; It was truly a groundless lie .
Unless in his unique mathematics zero equals &quot; a considerably large portion , &quot; such a statement runs completely against the facts and is a shameless lie .
Since the southern Anhwei incident in January 1941 , the Kuomintang government declared the New 4th Army a &quot; rebel army &quot; and completely cut off all supplies to the 8th Route Army .
Not only did it not distribute even one gun , one bullet , one pill , or one penny to the Communist Party , but it blockaded and surrounded the Shensi @-@ Kansu @-@ Ninghsia Border Region and the liberated areas behind enemy lines with several hundred thousand troops and confiscated all resources entering the Border Region , including several tons of medical supplies solicited by the China Defense Alliance from England and America .
Until now this situation , has not changed in the least bit .
The only contact between the Chinese Communist Party and the lend @-@ lease supplies is the anticommunist Kuomintang troops armed with &quot; a considerably large portion &quot; of lend @-@ lease supplies besieging the Border Region .
Therefore , Wei &apos;s words should be changed to fit the facts : &quot; Among the lend @-@ lease supplies shipped to the Central Government for use against Japan , a considerably large portion has been distributed to the anticommunist troops for another use . &quot;
As for why Wei would tell such a shameless lie , it is not hard to understand .
It was because public opinion in America and England and the responsible officials of their governments had shown great concern over the relations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and over the use of the lend @-@ lease supplies by the Kuomintang government .
Recently , U.S.
Under Secretary of State Joseph C.
Grew and Leader of the British House of Lords and Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Viscount Craneborne both openly
indicated that they hoped , for China &apos;s unity and would &quot; render aid to the Chinese Government and the communist government in Yenan regardless of their differences . &quot; ( K &apos;o @-@ lan @-@ po @-@ en &apos;s words ) .
Agitated , the Kuomintang absolutists ordered their ambassador , at whatever cost , to tell lies in public , making such statements as &quot; the National Government has made many compromises with the Communist Party &quot; and &quot; a considerably large portion has been distributed to the Communist Party &quot; for the purpose of hoodwinking international public opinion and in order to preserve their fascist regime of one @-@ party dictatorship .
Nevertheless , the international public opinion and foreign statesmen , like the people of China , are not easily deceived by lies .
We advise the Kuomintang authorities to show a modicum of national integrity and not let their foreign ambassadors forever be regarded as swindlers and liars .

RESPONSIBLE PERSONS OF CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITEEE ANNOUNCE THEY WILL NOT ATTEND THE CURRENT SESSION OF THE PEOPLE &apos;S POLITICAL COUNCIL
6 June 1945
&#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY , Yenan , 16 JuneWhen asked by a HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY reporter whether Chinese Communist Party members would attend the new session of the PeopleTs Political Council to be convened on 7 July by the Kuomintang government , responsible persons of the Chinese Communist Central answered as follows :
In regard to the so @-@ called People &apos;s Political Council to be convened on
7 July by the Kuomintang government , no one from the Chinese Communist Party will attend , for the following reasons : ( 1 ) Since last September the Chinese Communist Party and the Democratic Alliance of China and other broad democratic groups have been unanimously requesting that the Kuomintang government promptly abolish the one @-@ party dictatorship , call a meeting of delegates of all parties and factions and those without party or factional affiliations , form a provisional democratic coalition government , promulgate a democratic program , and realize democratic reforms in order to mobilize and unite all the resist @-@ Japan forces of the Chinese people , effectively coordinate with the Allies to defeat the Japanese aggressors , and , by means of such a coalition government and in accordance with democratic principles , after the liberation of the entire nation , introduce a free and unrestricted popular election , hold a national people &apos;s congress , draw up a constitution , and elect an official government .
This request actually reflects the opinion of the majority of the Chinese people .
However , after several discussions between representatives of this party and the Kuomintang government , the request was rejected by the Kuomintang government .
As for the minimum conditions to recover unity and form a coalition government , such as abolishing the decrees suppressing the people &apos;s freedom , disbanding the secret service , releasing jailed Communist Party members and all patriotic elements , recognizing the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party and other democratic parties and factions , recognizing the liberated areas of China , and withdrawing the troops besieging and attacking the liberated areas , not only has the Kuomintang been unwilling to accede to a single item , but it has reinforced its reactionary measures to destroy unity and sabotage the
resistance war .
( 2 ) In regard to the holding of a so @-@ called new PeopleTs Political Council at this time , the Kuomintang government did not consult this party in advance or any other democratic parties and factions .
As in the case of past sessions , it has been handled exclusively by the Kuomintang , According to the decrees of the Kuomintang government , the Chinese Communist Party and other democratic parties and factions are not legitimate even today .
Even the Chinese Communist Party members of the People &apos;s Political Council were designated by the Kuomintang authorities , not selected by the Chinese Communist Party itself .
Meanwhile , the resist @-@ Japan forces led by the Chinese Communist Party have become the nucleus for defeating the national enemy and liberating the Chinese people .
The attitude of the Kuomintang government toward the Chinese Communist Party is not only contrary to democratic principles but also incompatible with the latter &apos;s position in the resistance war .
( 3 ) What is even more important is that the Sixth Kuomintang National Party Congress , disregarding the opposition of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party and other democratic parties and factions , arbitrarily decided to call , on 12 November this year , a so @-@ called people &apos;s congress for the purpose of splitting the people and preparing for a civil war , and the Kuomintang will force the forthcoming session of the People &apos;s Political Council to pass many concrete measures in order to carry out its reactionary resolutions .
If such is the case , it will be a grave mistake , and a large @-@ scale civil war against the nation , the people and democracy will break , out .
Obviously this will result only in benefiting the Japanese aggressors .
In view of these reasons , the Chinese Communist Party has decided not to attend this session of the PeopleTs Political Council in order to express its protest .

SPEECH AT MEMORIAL MEETING FOR CHINA &apos;S REVOLUTIONARY MARTYRS 17 June 1945
&#91; Text &#93; After the public offering of sacrifice , Chairman Mao presented his eulogy , which briefly is as follows :
In the past 100 years , especially since the founding of the Chinese Communist Party 24 years ago , the Chinese people , Chinese democrats and the communists , in order to resist the double oppression of foreign imperialism and domestic feudal power and build China into an independent , free , democratic , united and strong new nation , have been waging an incessant and powerful struggle , and innumerable revolutionary patriots have sacrificed themselves in this great struggle .
The reactionaries attempt to quell the revolution by means of massacres .
They feel that the greater the number of people killed , the smaller will be the revolution .
However , it has turned out to be otherwise .
Actually , the more people the reactionaries kill , the greater is the revolutionary strength and the larger the number of reactionaries who will perish .
This is an irresistible principle .
Hitler and Mussolini of foreign countries , the fascism of Japan and the Manchurian government and Pei @-@ yang warlords of China have all proved this point .
Though hundreds of thousands and millions of China &apos;s revolutionary people have been slaughtered , hundreds of thousands and millions more will rise and continue the revolution , and no one can subjugate them .
Today the resist @-@ Japan democratic movement of China &apos;s broad masses , the liberated areas of 100 million people , the people &apos;s resistance troops of 1 million , the 1.21 million Communist Party members , and the program for ChinaTs revolution decided on by the Seventh CCP Congress have all been created by the bloody sacrifices of the several million democrats and several hundred thousand communists and their decades of struggle .
Now the Chinese people understand how to unite and how to struggle .
China will belong to the people , and China will defeat the Japanese aggressors and their running dogs and build an independent , free , democratic , united and powerful new China .
The desire of all the revolutionary martyrs of the past 100 years , especially the recent 24 years , will be successfully realized .

COMMENTS ON CHIANG KAI @-@ SHEK &apos;S SPEECH OK 7 JULY 8 July 1945
&#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY , Yenan , 8 JulyA HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY reporter writes :
with this situation .
That over 200 of the 600 delegates to the Sixth Kuomintang Congress in May submitted their resignation from the party because of their hatred for Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s despotic conduct was clear proof .
In his speech yesterday he bragged about the accuracy of his predictions .
Yet , on 15 October 1931 he said to the demonstrating students at the Nanking Central Military Academy : &quot; If , 3 years from now , the lost territory is not recovered , you can chop off my head as my apology . &quot; In July 1934 , when giving the &quot; Speech of the Spirit &quot; to the Lu @-@ shan officers training corps , he said that , In regard to the Japanese , &quot; they only have to issue one order and they will , within 3 days , occupy all the crucial areas and destroy China . &quot; Have those words come true ?
Yesterday he said such things as &quot; the coming year will be a year of war results . &quot; The method of operation of Chiang Kai @-@ shek and his clique is to rely on America for everything .
Thus , several years from now the Chinese people will see that China under Chiang Kai @-@ shek1s control will be dragged into a colonial position , and this will be a concrete &quot; war result . &quot; America &apos;s imperialist elements such as Hurley and China &apos;s feudal compradore fascist elements such as Chiang Kai @-@ shek have become sweet partners .
Chiang Kai @-@ shek has been equipped with large stocks of arms , topped with gold , reportedly for the purpose of fighting Japan .
Nevertheless , the clear @-@ sighted have long ago seen that these are for nothing else than to create a civil war in China .
This is because AmericaTs imperialist elements , those like Hurley , desperately wish to preserve Chiang Kai @-@ shek1s dictatorial system and regard the democratic strength of the Chinese people as a thorn in their side .
If this reactionary policy is not changed , China &apos;s civil war will be inevitable .
Currently , the focus of all Chiang Kai &apos;shek &apos;s military arrangements is on a civil war .
&quot; Tolerance &quot; is merely a word to prepare for a civil war .
Once a civil war breaks out , can China under Chiang Kai @-@ shekfs control escape the destiny of a colony ?
True , besides preserving Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s dictatorial system and attempting to turn China into an American colony , some of America &apos;s ruling figures actually want to defeat the Japanese aggressors .
On this point we have no quarrel with the American Government .
However , in the past 6 months the American policy of supporting Chiang , and resisting the communists is , in essence , a policy of helping Chiang fight a civil war .
We hope that all good American people and enlightened figures in the American Government will give full attention to this point and promptly rectify it .
Otherwise , the result created by the Americans will be detrimental to the American people as well as to the Chinese .
When it comes to the attitude of the Chinese people toward Chiang Kai @-@ shek , one can say that it has reached the limits of tolerance .
As of now the Chinese people still agree to let him have a position in the coalition government , so that he will have a chance to reform himself completely and compensate for his mistakes by merits .
Nevertheless , he has , as a matter of fact , long lost all qualifications as a national leader .
Except for a small group of Chinese and foreigners who still support him , the broad masses have long ago deserted him , calling him &quot; Chiang Who Ought To Be Killed , &quot; Even so , the Chinese people are still willing to give him a chance to reform , which is an attitude of extreme tolerance .
In China , only this
kind of tolerance is genuine , while Chiang Kai @-@ shekTs so @-@ called &quot; tolerance &quot; is merely another name for preparing a civil war .
The Chinese people must heighten their vigilance , oppose the association of foreign and Chinese reactionaries to create a civil war against the nation , democracy and the people , and use all means to block it .
In order to smash the Japanese aggressors and liberate the Chinese people , such vigilance is indispensable .

CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE DECLARATION ON THE CURRENT SITUATION 25 August 1945
&#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY , Yenan , 26 AugustOn the 25th the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee published a declaration on the current situation .
The full text is as follows :
Countrymen of the whole nation !
With Japan &apos;s surrender the sacred resistance war waged by our entire nation in the past 8 years has ended successfully !
The antifascist war of the whole world has also ended successfully !
Throughout China and the whole world a new perioda period of peaceful reconstructionhas arrived !
The Chinese Communist Party feels that , in this new historical period , the momentous task confronting our entire nation is : Consolidate domestic unity , assure domestic peace , introduce democracy , and improve the people &apos;s living in order to realize national unification , build an independent , free , and powerful new China on the foundation of peace , democracy and unity , and consolidate , together with England , America , the Soviet Union and all allied nations , a permanent international peace .
Countrymen of the whole nation !
The successful conclusion of the war against Japan , the final destruction of fascist tyranny , enslavement , and aggression , and the future of peaceful development unfolding before all mankind are the outcome of the joint efforts of England , America , the Soviet Union and China , the four great allied nations , and of the joint efforts of all the soldiers and civilians of China .
We believe that our countrymen throughout the nation will shift the courageous struggle and dauntless spirit they manifested in the resistance war to the great cause of national reconstruction .
That the 100 million people of China &apos;s liberated areas made the maximum effort and sacrifices in the resistance war is publicly recognized here and abroad .
In the period of peaceful reconstruction hereafter , they must continue to serve as the models of democratic construction and the backbone of peaceful unity in the entire nation and perform their great obligations .
However , the road of struggle for an independent . , free and powerful new China is not without obstacles , difficulties and hardships .
The Japanese imperialist aggressors have not yet implemented the Potsdam Agreement or relinquished their attempt to revive aggressive militarism ; they are still recklessly carrying out their conspiracy to provoke , split and enslave China .
Their running dogs in China , in accordance with the instructions of their masters , have acquired a protective coloring with one shake of their body in order to continue their provocation of a civil war , sabotage unity , and block democracy .
Their attempt has not met with discouragement , nor have they been punished for their criminal acts .
On the contrary , they have received encouragement and are becoming ever more arrogant .
Therefore , the many dangerous activities of ChinaTs puppets and other reactionaries seriously threaten China &apos;s peace , democracy and unity .
The Chinese people must be extremely vigilant and smash the enemy &apos;s conspiracies .
The Chinese Communist Party feels that , currently , we must ask the National Government to immediately introduce a certain number of emergency measures in order to lay the foundation for peaceful reconstruction .
These emergency measures are :
( 1 ) Recognise the government elected by the people and the resist @-@ Japan troops in China &apos;s liberated areas , and withdraw the troops besieging and attacking the liberated areas in order to realize peace immediately and avoid a civil war .
( 2 ) Designate the areas for accepting the surrender of the Japanese troops by the 8th Route Army , the New 4th Army , and the South China Resist @-@ Japan Column and , in order to show fairness , grant them the right to participate in all work connected with the handling of Japan .
( 3 ) Severely punish the traitors ; disband the puppet troops .
04 ) Reorganize the troops and handle demobilization fairly and rationally ; give relief to the refugees and reduce taxes in order to lessen the burden of the people .
( 5 ) Recognize the legitimacy of the parties and factions ; abolish all decrees blocking the people &apos;s freedom of meeting , association , speech and publication ; abolish the secret service organ ; release patriotic political prisoners .
( 6 ) Immediately call a meeting of all parties and factions and those without party or factional affiliations to discuss the major postwar issues , formulate a democratic political program , end political tutelage , form a democratic coalition government supported by the entire nation , and prepare for a free and unrestricted general election to elect a people &apos;s congress .
The Chinese Communist Party declares that it is willing to strive for an agreement with the Chinese Kuomintang and the democratic parties and factions in order to promptly solve all the emergency issues , attain permanent unity and thoroughly implement Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s three principles of democracy .
Countrymen !
The resistance war has been won !
A new period of peaceful reconstruction has begun !
We must adhere to peace , democracy and unity and struggle for an independent , free and powerful new China !

INTERVIEW WITH &apos; TA KUNG PAO1 CORRESPONDENT 5 September 1945
&#91; Text &#93; TA KUNG PAO on 6 September published an interview with Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung .
When receiving a reporter of this paper yesterday afternoon , Mao Tse @-@ tung stated :
After having been in Chungking for 5 days and discussing the issue of unity with the Central Government , I have no concrete results to report to my countrymen as yet .
The only thing which can be said is that a civil war will definitely be avoided .
If China &apos;s political and military commands remain disunited , this will be an impossible situation .
Yet , unity in political and military commands must be founded on democratic politics .
Only a political conference including the representatives of all parties and factions and those without party or factional affiliations will solve the current national issues , and only a democratic and united coalition government will bring happiness to the people .
Democracy means power for the people .
The situation in the Border Region and liberated areas is different from that in other areas .
We have a government elected by the people and a self @-@ defense army , but no tithing chiefs .
Tithing chiefs control the people and are most undesirable .
Another result of our discussions is the postponement of a people &apos;s congress ; no accord has been reached on the issue of delegates .
The Chinese Communist Party does not wish to retain the old delegates ; it advocates , in principle , a general election .
Finally , commenting on the Sino @-@ Soviet treaty , Mao Tse @-@ tung said : This treaty is a safeguard for peace in the Far East .
Some people find it unfavorable to China &apos;s democratic movement , but actually the opposite is true .
We can wait and see with our eyes peeled .
Others are amazed that the Soviet Union considers the National Government the objective , but actually there is no other objective than the National Government .
Nevertheless , the treaty does not restrict the right of the Soviet Union to criticize ChinaTs politics , and it may still express its opinion publicly .
A few days ago an article in the Soviet RED STAR stated that China should proceed toward democratic politics , and it eagerly hoped for unity between China &apos;s two parties .
China is fortunate to have a powerful ally .
We should not suspect aggression by another nation .
Mao Tse @-@ tung then expressed his hope that the discussions would produce early results .

At the tea , Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung made a statement , which briefly is as follows :

After 8 years of resistance war , victory has finally arrived , especially in the Northeast , which , after 14 years of enemy occupation since the 18 September Incident , has now been successfully liberated .
On this day I feel doubly excited .
I am most honored to be able to see you gentlemen , ray friends and my elders during this period .
I recall the extreme hardships during the resistance war .
However , as a result of the unanimous effort of the entire country , we have safely weathered them .
I am most grateful to Chairman Chiang for his invitation to come to Chungking to discuss national affairs together .
The future must be a new era of peaceful development and national reconstruction , and we must unite and firmly avoid a civil war .
Any other policy would be wrong .
Therefore , all parties and factions must , under the above policy , unite as one and thoroughly implement the three principles of democracy in order to build a modern new China .

ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY REUTER CORRESPONDENT CAMPBELL Published by HSIN @-@ HUA JIH @-@ PAO , Chungking , 27 September 1945
&#91; Text &#93; Editor &apos;s Note : During the period of Chairman Mao &apos;s visit to Chungking between 28 August and li October 1945 to attend the negotiations upon invitation , British REUTER correspondent Mr Campbell submitted 12 written questions , and Chairman Mao answered them one by one .
The original text was published in the Chungking HSIN @-@ HUA JIH @-@ PAO on 27 September .
( 1 ) Question : Is it possible to avoid a civil war by means of an agreement instead of by force ?
Answer : It is possible , because it will be compatible with the interests of the Chinese people and of China &apos;s party in power .
Currently , China only needs the policy of peaceful national reconstruction and nothing else ; therefore , a civil war must be firmly avoided .
( 2 ) Question : What concessions are the Chinese Communist Party ready to make in order to reach an agreement ?
Answer : On the condition of realizing national peace , democracy , and unity , the Chinese Communist Party is ready to make important concessions , including reducing the liberated areas and the troops .
( 3 ) Question : What compromises or concessions must the Central Government make before it can satisfy the Chinese Communist Party ?
Answer : The views of the Chinese Communist Party were expressed in the recent declaration of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee .
It requests that the Kuomintang government recognize the government of the liberated areas elected by the people and the people &apos;s army , permit them to participate in accepting Japan &apos;s surrender , severely punish the traitors and puppet troops , reorganize the troops fairly and rationally , protect the people &apos;s freedoms and rights , and form a democratic coalition government .
( 4 ) Question : Are you hopeful that the negotiations will produce an agreement , or even a temporary agreement ?
Answer : I have full confidence in the results of the negotiations , feeling that , with the common effort and -mutual compromise of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party , the negotiations will produce not just a temporary agreement but one which will guarantee a long @-@ term peaceful reconstruction .
( 5 ) Question : If the negotiations should break down , would it be possible to solve the Kuomintang @-@ Comtnunist Party issue without bloodshed ?
Answer ; I doaTt believe the negotiations will break down , In any situation the Chinese Communist Party will adhere to the policy of avoiding a civil war . , .
There may be difficulties , but it is possible to overcome them .
( 6 ) Question !
What is the attitude of the Communist Party toward the Sino @-@ Soviet treaty ?
Answer ; We fully support the Sino ^ Soviet treaty and hope for its early realization , because it will benefit the people of the two nations and world peace , especially peace in the Far East .
( 7 ) Question ; After Japan1s surrender , do you plan to continue occupying the areas you now occupy ?
Answer ; The Communist Party requests that the Central Government recognize the government of the liberated areas elected by the people and the people &apos;s troops .
It is only asking the government to introduce local self @-@ government long promised by the Kuomintang in order to safeguard the local democratic reforms In the political , military , economic and educational spheres carried out by the people during the war .
All the reforms are compatible with the ideals of Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen , the creator of the Kuomintang ,
( 8 ) Question ; If a coalition government is formed , to what extent are you prepared tq cooperate with Chlang Kai @-@ shek ?
Answer ; If a coalition government is formed , the Communist Party will do its utmost to cooperate with Chairman Chiang in order to build an independent , free , and powerful new China and thoroughly implement Dr Sun Yat @-@ senTs three principles of democracy .
( 9 ) Question : ( i ) How many Communist Party members in North China will be influenced by your action and decision ?
( ii ) How many of them are armed ?
( iii ) In what other areas are Chinese Communist Party members active ?
Answer ; The policy for Communist Party members is decided by the party &apos;s Central Committee .
The Chinese Communist Party now has over 1.2 million members , and the number of people who have acquired a democratic life under the party &apos;s leadership far exceeds 100 million .
According to the principle
of spontaneity , they have organized over 1.2 million troops and over 2.2 million militia .
Besides the North China provinces and the Shensi @-@ Kansu @-@ Ninghsia Border Region in the Northwest , they are distributed in Kiangsu , Anhwei , Chekiang , Fukien , Honan , Hupeh , Hunan and Kwangtung .
Chinese Communist Party members are distributed throughout all provinces in the nation ,
( 10 ) What are the concept and definition of a free and democratic China according to the Chinese Communist Party ?
Answer : A free and democratic China will be this kind of nation : All levels of government , including the central government , are created by general and equal secret balloting and are responsible to the people who elected them .
It will implement Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s three principles of democracy , Lincoln &apos;s principle of &quot; of the people , by the people , and for the people , &quot; and Roosevelt &apos;s Atlantic Charter .
It will assure the independence and unity of the nation and cooperate with all democratic powers .
( 11 ) Question : In the coalition government of all parties and factions , what are the reconstruction and recovery policies of the Chinese Communist Party ?
Answer : Besides the democratic reform of military affairs and politics , the Chinese Communist Party will propose to the government the introduction of an economic and cultural construction program .
The goal of the program is mainly to reduce the people &apos;s burden , improve the people &apos;s life , implement land reform and industrialization , encourage private enterprise ( except those units of a monopolistic nature which must be operated by the democratic government ) , welcome foreign investment and develop &apos; international trade under the principle of equality and mutual benefit , popularize mass education , and wipe out illiteracy .
All these are compatible with Dr Sun Yat @-@ senTs instructions .
( 12 ) Question : Do you support nationalizing the troops and abolishing private forces ?
Answer : We fully support nationalizing the troops and abolishing private forces , and the common prerequisite of the two matters is democratization of the state .
What is commonly known as the &quot; Communist Party army &quot; has actually been voluntarily organized by the Chinese people during the war , and its only duty is to defend the nation .
It is a new @-@ model army , completely different from the old @-@ type troops of the past in China belonging to private individuals .
Its democratic essence will furnish valuable experience for the true nationalization of China &apos;s troops and serve as a reference for the improvement of its other military units .

&#91; Text &#93; Mr Chang Chih @-@ chung gave a big reception on the evening of 8 October in the Military Affairs Commission auditorium for Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung .
At the start of the reception Minister Chang , as the host , first made a statement .
( Middle portion omittedEditor ) Immediately thereafter Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung made a statement .
He said :
For my trip to Chungking this time I must thank Mr Chiang for his invitation and for his hospitality of more than 40 days .
I thank Mr Chang Wen @-@ pai , the host tonight , for such a big banquet , and I also thank the people of all fields attending the reception .
The people of the whole nation , our friends of the whole world , and the governments of our Allies are interested in the negotiations , because they concern not just the two parties but are linked with the interests of the people of the whole nation .
The progress of the negotiations , as mentioned by Mr Chang , makes us optimistic .
After the defeat of fascism in the East and the West , the world has become a bright world , and China has become a bright China .
In the last 30 years the world has undergone two great wars .
The nature of the second war was different from the first one .
During the war this time the world and China both made rapid progress .
The goal of the current negotiations is to realize peaceful national reconstruction .
Today China has only one pathpeace .
Peace is supreme , and anything else is wrong .
( Applause ) The negotiations are being conducted in a friendly atmosphere .
As regards those issues on which no accord has been reached , we have agreed to solve them by continued negotiations , and not by any other means .
The policy of realizing unification on the foundation of peaceful and democratic unity is compatible with the demand of the people of the whole nation and with that of the people of the whole world and the allied governments .
Peace and cooperation must be long @-@ term .
All of us must , with one mind , refrain from making other calculations and form a plan of long @-@ term cooperation .
( Applause ) The people of the whole country and all parties and factions must strive unanimously for several decades and , under the leadership of Chairman Chiang , thoroughly realise the three principles of democracy and build an independent , free and powerful new China !
That there will be difficulties must not be denied ; it will be detrimental if this point is not brought to our attention .
The Chinese people are now faced with difficulties , and there will be many more difficulties in the future .
But the Chinese people do not fear difficulties .
When the Kuornintang and the Communist Party and all parties and factions are united , we will not fear difficulties .
Regardless of how great the difficulties , under the policy of peace , democracy and unification , under the leadership of Chairman Chiang , and under the policy of thoroughly implementing the three principles of democracy , all difficulties will be surmounted .
( Loud applause ) Long live the new China !
Long live Chairman Chiang !

PEOPLE OF CHINA AND AMERICA : ARISE TO STOP THE EXPANSION OF THE CHINESE CIVIL WAR
15 November 1945
&#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY , Yenan , 15 NovemberIn view of the extremely tense situation in the Shanhaikuan area , a HSIN @-@ HUA reporter made an urgent appeal to the people of China and America :
Just when the Kuomintang promises to call a political conference and pretends to seek peace by negotiations , the biggest battle in the undeclared civil war has flared up in the Shanhaikuan area .
One special feature of this battle is that the Kuomintang is mustering all its crack troops in this area .
It has already transferred , or is preparing to transfer , as many as six armies , i.e. , the 13th , 92d , 94th , 16th , 52d ( and another army whose number will be ascertained ) , using five of them to attack the Shanhaikuan line and the 92d against Jehol in coordination .
The second special feature of this battle is most brazenly manifested in the armed intervention in China &apos;s internal affairs by American troops stationed in China .
All the Kuomintang troops are aided by American troops and transported by American ships and planes .
Ch &apos;inhuangtao , the base of the Kuomintang troops south of Shanhaikuan , has been set up singlehandedly by the American troops , and currently American troops are still stationed there to defend it .
All these Kuomintang troops have been , under the excuse of &quot; preparing to launch a counteroffensive against Japan , &quot; equipped with American arms and trained by American officers .
All are currently under the &quot; assistant &quot; direction of American officers .
In some units every regiment has 10 American officers and every battalion 1 .
American troops supply the Kuomintang troops with heavy armsartillery , tanks , planes , etc .
The ammunition , provisions , and gasoline of the Kuomintang troops have all been transported by American ships and planes .
Even the coal for the Kuomintang troops is produced by mines &quot; protected &quot; by American troops and shipped on railways &quot; protected &quot; by American troops .
Without such conduct of &quot; noninterference in China &apos;s internal affairs , &quot; such conduct of &quot; not getting involved in China &apos;s civil war , &quot; such conduct of &quot; not &apos;hoping for China &apos;s domestic disputes , &quot; and such conduct of &quot; not helping the Central army in the anticommunist war &quot; on the part of the American troops stationed in China , how could the Shanhaikuan battle of such unprecedented magnitude have been started ?
Is such conduct by the American troops for the purpose of disarming and repatriating the Japanese ?
Isn &apos;t it 10,000 li from the subject matter ?
Isn &apos;t it a case of the cart in the south and the tracks in the north ?
Wedermeyer repeats over and over again the phrase &quot; protection of American life and property , &quot; while at the same time he puts many Americans among the Kuomintang troops , on the battlefield , and under cannonfire where death stalks constantly .
Are these the means to &quot; protect American life ? &quot; For the American soldiers to die in a reactionary civil war blocking the independence and freedom of the Chinese people , instead of in the just war against Japan , what is the signifance and what the value ?
The HSIN @-@ HUA reporter appealed to all the people of China and America or their attention :
An unprecedented massacre will take place in the Shanhaikuan area .
It will be a dirty massacre .
In its actual significance it is not only China &apos;s civil war but a war of the American troops stationed in China against the Chinese people .
It must be stopped immediately !
The people of China and America in all fields must immediately send their investigation teams there , rise unanimously , and stop the massacre by all possible means .
Take prompt action , stop the imminent big battle in the Shanhaikuan area , and save the thousands and tens of thousands of sons of the Chinese and American people !
Oppose the Kuomintang &apos;s attack against the liberated areas !
Oppose armed intervention in China &apos;s internal affairs !

YENAN AUTHORITIES COMMENT ON THE ISSUE OF CALLING A PEOPLE &apos;S CONGRESS , SAYING THAT THE KUOMINTANG &apos;S UNILATERAL ACTION INDICATES ITS DECISION TO START A LARGE @-@ SCALE CIVIL WAR
16 November 1945
&#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY , Yenan , 16 NovemberAccording to a report disseminated by REUTER and the U.S.
Information Office , the National Government on the 12th of this month declared that a people &apos;s congress would be called on 5 May next year .
No further details have been learned .
Nevertheless , Yenan is paying serious attention to the report , feeling that the Kuomintang and the National Government have betrayed , once again , the &quot; Double @-@ Ten Agreement . &quot; The full text on the people &apos;s congress in the &quot; Synopsis of the Kuomintang @-@ Communist Negotiations &quot; published on the 12th of last month is as follows : &quot; 3 .
Concerning the issue of a people &apos;s congress , the Chinese Communist Party proposes three items : Reelect the delegates to the people &apos;s congress ; postpone the holding of a people &apos;s congress ; revise the organization and election laws of the people &apos;s congress and the 5 May draft constitution .
The government expressed the following opinion : The credentials of the delegates already elected to the people7s congress must remain valid , and their number would be rationally increased and legitimately solved ; the people of the various fields had been activated to study and discuss the 5 May draft constitution and express their views on revisions .
Therefore , no accord was reached between the two sides .
Nevertheless , the Communist Party declared that it would not let the dispute over this issue break up the unity .
Both sides agreed to submit the issue to the Political Conference for solution . &quot; In the &quot; Synopsis &quot; it was provided that &quot; conferring on national affairs and discussing the program of peaceful reconstruction and the various issues of the people &apos;s congress &quot; constituted the main topics of the Political Conference .
Barely 1 month after the publication of the &quot; Synopsis &quot; and before the holding of the Political Conference , the National Government , by its unilateral action , actually announced the date for the holding of a people &apos;s congress .
This proves that , in regard to any major political issue , the Kuomintang has no sincere intention to resort to political means and solve the issues by consulting with all the parties and factions .
It also shows that the Kuomintang government has made the decision to split domestic unity and
launch a large @-@ scale civil war .
The same authorities indicate that , given .
such an arbitrary unilateral action on the part of the National Government , whether the Political Conference , with the discussion of issues concerning the peopled congress as one of its major topics , still has any significance is highly questionable .
Furthermore , even after the start of the Political Conference , who can guarantee that the Kuomintang will not again break its promise and tear up any agreement reached at the conference ?
0 CHIEH @-@ FANG JIH @-@ PAO , 17 November 1945 .
CHIANG KAI @-@ SHEK &apos;S NEW YEAR SPEECH AND THE POLITICAL CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE 7 January 1946
&#91; Text &#93; It is reported that the Political Consultative Conference , postponed time and again by the Kuomintang , will convene on the 10th of this month .
Though the Kuomintang government agreed to call the conference last October , it is reported that even today , some 3 months later , the Kuomintang has not made &quot; preparations &quot; or given any constructive indications .
The Chungking press has long indicated that the Kuomintang takes a superficial attitude toward this conference , which has the unanimous serious attention of all fields here and abroad , and that it does not intend to solve any issue by it .
This attitude has been completely verified in the New Year broadcast of National Government chairman and Kuomintang director general Chiang Kai @-@ shek .
Why do all of China and the whole world pay serious attention to the Political Consultative Conference ?
In a word , they hope that it will find a solution for China &apos;s current dangerous political situation , i.e. , stopping the civil war , and make decisive reforms in the dictatorial system , which is the source of the civil war .
The one @-@ party , military , and personal dictatorship of the National Government should have been abolished long ago .
As early as in the fall of the year before last , public opinion of China and foreign countries ( primarily America ) proposed the formation of a coalition government and a coalition command headquarters .
Immediately thereafter the Chinese Communist Party , based on this proposal , made a formal written suggestion to the Kuomintang authorities which won the support of President Roosevelt .
Thereafter , though , as President Roosevelt stated , &quot; everything now seems to be hopeless , because the Kuomintang expressed entirely fallacious opposition to the revisions proposed by Yenan &quot; ( Snow : &quot; The Model of Soviet Political Power , &quot; Ch 8 ) , and China &apos;s democratic parties and factions not only did not abandon the proposal but demanded that a conference of delegates of all parties and factions and democratic elements without party or factional affiliations be held first , so that a coalition government and a coalition command headquarters could be realized through the conference .
At the end of last August , when Comrade Mao Tse @-@ tung , upon Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s invitation , went to Chungking to discuss national affairs , he
again brought up the issue of calling such a conference .
As the arrogant Kuomintang authorities adamantly refused to accept such designations as &quot; party and factional conference &quot; or &quot; political conference , &quot; while the Communist Party delegates , striving for unity , did not wish to argue endlessly on the subject , the designation was recorded in the &quot; Synopsis of Negotiations &quot; as the Political Consultative Conference .
But its tasks were still described as &quot; ending political tutelage ; introducing constitutional politics ...
discussing the issues of national affairs , peaceful national construction , and the National Congress . &quot; What is the meaning of discussing national affairs and the National Congress ?
Obviously , the fundamental issue of national affairs today , aside from stopping the civil war , is to end the so @-@ called &quot; political tutelage &quot; of one @-@ party , military , and personal dictatorship .
As the Kuomintang &quot; National Congress , &quot; exclusively created by the Kuoraintang &quot; political tutelage &quot; authorities , opposes democracy , strengthens dictatorship , sabotages unity , aggravates division , and attempts to legalize the one @-@ party dictatorship and extend it indefinitely , in order to end the Kuomintang &apos;s one @-@ party dictatorship the National Congress exclusively handled by one party must be simultaneously ended , a coalition government and a coalition command headquarters created , a true National Congress prepared and convened by the coalition government , and democratic constitutional politics introduced .
The fundamental crux of China &apos;s national affairs was clearly expressed in U.S.
President Truman &apos;s announcement of 15 December last year .
President Truman demanded that &quot; the National Government and the Chinese Communist Party and China &apos;s other dissident armed units negotiate and cease hostile actions &quot; and that &quot; a conference of delegates of the najor political factions in the entire nation be convened in .
order to solve the current internal dispute promptly and hasten China * s unification . &quot; Meanwhile , to solve the internal dispute and hasten unification , the delegates conference must possess the power to end the one @-@ party dictatorship and reorganize the National Government .
President Truman said : &quot; The United States well knows that the current Chinese National Government is a one @-@ party government and believes that , if the foundation of this government is enlarged to include other domestic parties and factions , it will promote China &apos;s peace , unity , and democracy .
Therefore , the United States strongly advocates that the delegates of all China &apos;s major political elements hold a national conference and decide on the means to enable them to enjoy fair and effective representation in the Chinese National Government .
The United States Government feels that it will require the revision of the one @-@ party political tutelage system created by Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen , the father of the Republic of China , as a temporary measure during the nation &apos;s advance toward democracy . &quot; President Truman affirmed that political democratization is the prerequisite for the nationalization of the armed forces .
He said : &quot; Once an extensive parliamentary representative government is formed ...
the autonomous military forces and all armed units in China must be effectively combined into a Chinese national army . &quot; On 27 December the official report of the Moscow three @-@ nation foreign ministers conference reiterated the necessity for the democratization of the National Government , and its language was
even clearer : &quot; All the democratic elements in the nation must be widely absorbed into all ( or all levels of ) the structures of the National Government . &quot; On 30 December U.S.
Secretary of State Byrnes in his broadcast also repeated this theme and clearly pointed out that unity could be attained only through peace and democracy : &quot; To assure a united , peaceful , and democratic China under the National Government , the civil war must be stopped and the democratic elements must be permitted broad participation in the National Government . &quot; Now the facts are clear : The tasks of the Political Consultative Conference are to realize unconditional cessation of the civil war , to end the one @-@ party dictatorship , to reorganize the National Government , to form a democratic coalition government , and to provide extensive , fair , and effective representation of all democratic elements in all structures of the entire democratic coalition National Government .
Since this democratic coalition government must unconditionally and effectively end the one @-@ party political tutelage system , it naturally must unconditionally and effectively end the one @-@ party National Congress , the bastard of one @-@ party political tutelage ; naturally the 5 May &quot; transfer of power &quot; arranged by the Kuomintang authorities to the mysterious bastard , which is not recognized by any democratic element , prior to the formation of an &quot; effective &quot; democratic government ( which is entirely possible ) , making China more dictatorial and divided and embellishing such a &quot; transfer &quot; as &quot; constitutional politics &quot; in order to hoodwink our countrymen , must not be permitted .
The Political Consultative Conference , hoped for and closely watched by all of China and the whole world , is a plenary conference with the power to stop the civil war and end the one @-@ party dictatorship unconditionally .
On this point there is no room for any distortion or evasion .
The Kuomintang authorities expressed their consent to President Truman &apos;s announcement and the official report of the three @-@ nation foreign ministers conference .
Chiang Kai @-@ shek even said that &quot; President Truman &apos;s announcement and mine are identical ; his views are my views &quot; ; therefore , the people entertained high hopes regarding the meeting date of the Political Consultative Conference he announced and his simultaneous broadcast speech .
The people hoped that they would hear , in his speech , his views on the conference which would begin 10 days later and which would determine China &apos;s historical direction hereafter .
Unfortunately , though lavishly embellished with phrases about peace and democracy , Chiang Kai @-@ shek in his 5,000 @-@ word speech purposely refrained from mentioning the Political Consultative Conference or the announcements of President Truman and the three foreign ministers .
What is even more regrettable is that he has , in fact , absolutely rejected their suggestions on China and absolutely refused to confer any power on the Political Consultative Conference , not even the power to discuss the holding of the National Congress .
The Kuomintang authorities , without going through any discussions , declared last November that the National Congress would be convened on 5 May , and ChiangTs speech also confirmed it over and over again , though still maintaining that it was in response to the opinions of the various parties and factions .
In his
speech Chiang , without naming names , fiercely censured and maligned the Communist Party , blaming it for the civil war and all the destruction resulting from it .
But we do not wish to argue excessively , because in the past few months the Kuomintang ( especially the HO @-@ PTTNG JIH PAO of the Political Department of the Kuomintang Military Affairs Commission ) has consistently propagandized that &quot; the Communist Party is anti @-@ civil war &quot; while the Kuomintang is &quot; anti @-@ anti @-@ civil war . &quot; Just this one thing alone is sufficient to explain everything .
Our concern is Chiang &apos;s view of China &apos;s political future , as it is directly linked with the destiny of 450 million people .
Chiang has firmly declared that &quot; the only prerequisite for the solution of the current dispute and unrest &quot; is not peace and democracy but &quot; the unification of military and political commands , &quot; regardless of whether such military and political commands are against the interests of the state and the nation or whether they are against the people &apos;s fundamental rights and universal desire .
He also maintains that it is possible to end the civil war , ( which he fastidiously refers to as &quot; concluding military actions &quot; ; though the whole world is discussing China &apos;s civil war , China &apos;s Military Affairs Commission chairman has refused , even now , to admit its existence in China ) , but not without conditions .
&quot; Communications must first be restored , &quot; i.e. , the means for him to escalate the civil war must first be restored .
He says that the National Government can be enlarged , but not before the unification of the armed forces .
On the contrary , before the democratization of the government , the 8th Route Army and New 4th Army must first be handed over to the Kuomintang , i.e. , to him .
In other words , the means for expanding his dictatorship must first be assured .
He says that democracy can be realized , but not by means of a coalition government .
It must be accomplished by first convening , 4 months hence , a so @-@ called National Congress , or a dictatorial congress exclusively handled by one party , as &quot; the fundamental laws cannot be changed , &quot; i.e. , the dictatorial laws cannot be changed .
Chiang &apos;s interpretations are clearly opposed to the views of all the democratic elements in China and of President Truman and the foreign ministers of the three nations .
According to his interpretations , there is no need to hold the Political Consultative Conference .
Therefore , before the inauguration of the conference we must first look straight at , examine , and solve this fundamental division : On the one hand are the demands of all the democratic parties , factions and democratic figures and the entire population of China , as well as the desires of the people of America , the Soviet Union , and England as expressed by President Truman and the three foreign ministersthe unconditional cessation of the civil war , the ending of dictatorship , and the creation of a democratic coalition government via the Political Consultative Conference , thereby realizing the unification of China ; on the other hand are the attempts of Chiang Kai @-@ shek and the few military , party , and financial overlords in the Kuomintang forbidding the Political Consultative Conference from solving any issue , continuing the dictatorship , and backing up the continued dictatorship by means of continuing the civil war .
The former has the support of all of China and the entire world and , until the publication of Chiang &apos;s speech ,
the verbal support of the Kuomintang authorities .
But now Chiang has begun to attack these views , and the division has come to the surface .
Over a long period of time this paper has not taken notice of the despicable rumors and vilifications of the Kuomintang papers and the Kuomintang CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY , but when it comes to a division linked with the future of the state and the nation created by Ctiiang &apos;s speech , we , on the eve of the Political Consultative Conference , have no choice but to express our opinions .
Solving this division will involve a serious and complex process of struggle .
However , it will greatly educate the Chinese people and afford them every opportunity to discern the right and wrong , recognize the political theories of each and every party and faction , newspaper , and individual , and determine their standwhether they support or oppose the people .
When criticizing Chiang &apos;s speech , the NEW YORK HERALD TRIBUNE asked , &quot; How can peace in China be attained by repeating the old tunes ? &quot; Though the views expressed in the speech are tedious repetitions of old tunes long rejected by the people of the entire nation and clearly opposed to the views of the democratic elements in China and the democratic nations in the world , for the sake of being careful we will make a patient and objective examination of them and see whether they contain certain partial truths .
Chiang &apos;s fundamental view , similar to what the Kuomintang papers have been propagandizing in recent days , is that all Chinese affairs should be handed over to him and the small group around him for their dictatorial decisions ; as long as the people relinquish all their fundamental democratic rights and unconditionally obey all the military and political orders of the dictatorial group , then China will be unified and , after unification under the dictatorial group , the people will naturally be granted the opportunity for peaceful construction , democratic politics , and improvement of their lives .
However , if Chiang &apos;s dictatorial plans are not accepted , China will never be unified ; it will always suffer from civil war , dictatorship , poverty , and aggression .
Therefore , we wish to ask two questions according to the facts : First , will China be able to attain democracy by means of such dictatorial unification ?
Next , will China be able to attain unification by means of such a dictatorial method ?
The answer to the first question is in the negative .
In foreign countries , Hitler , Mussolini , and Japan &apos;s emperor all practiced such dictatorial unification .
However , under their unification they did not attain peace , democracy , or prosperity .
They claimed that national defense was consolidated , but the result was the destruction of their own nations .
As for China , the Chinese people have had much experience in such unification .
China has had a history of unification for several thousand years , and the unification was accomplished by dictatorial , or &quot; political tutelage , &quot; means ( Chiang on innumerable occasions extolled the &quot; democracy &quot; in China &apos;s era of tyranny and criticized the &quot; excessive freedom &quot; of the people at that time ) , but after several thousand years of tutelage &quot; no democracy was created as a result .
Since the founding of the republic ,
i
each and every warlord practicing military or personal tyranny declared that there would be peace and democracy under his unification .
But in all those 35 years no one has yet honored his promise .
Are there differences between Chiang Kai @-@ shek and his warlord forebears ?
There are .
First , he has a nationwide one @-@ party gestapo dictatorship which is a tool of terror undreamed of by the warlords of the past .
Next , his military tyranny is much more powerful than theirs , because he possesses an unprecedentedly huge , private , and secret service @-@ type army on a scale also undreamed of by the warlords of the past .
Finally , the extent to which his personal power is concentrated also far exceeds that of any warlord of the past * Whether in the party , army , or government , he reigns supreme .
His personal &quot; hand orders &quot; can change the decision of any government or military organ .
Therefore , aside from resistance by the people , there is no power which can restrict his activities .
Does Chiang have a greater &quot; democratic &quot; ideal than the warlords of the past ?
Absolutely not .
Chiang claims that he is unable to introduce democracy at present because of the lack of unification .
Such logic will not stand .
He has at least &quot; unified &quot; most of China over a period of 18 years , but when and where has he introduced the least bit of democracy or improved in the least bit the people &apos;s living conditions ?
The &quot; unification &quot; of ChiangTs area of control in the past 18 years has expanded year after year , while democracy has diminished year after year , because his secret service organ and secret service @-@ type army have developed year after year .
The poverty of the people and the economic crisis of the state have been aggravated year after year , because the control of his bureaucratic capital and corrupt and tyrannous group has grown year after year .
Though his troops and military budget have swelled year after year , facts since the 18 September incident , and especially since the 7 July incident , have proved that the national defense strength of his army has dropped alarmingly , because his army is intended only for the purpose of fighting civil wars and can only fight civil wars , and civil wars , which are destructive of the national defense strength in both the spiritual and material aspects , have never ceased in the past 18 years .
The saying &quot; expert in civil war , amateur in foreign war &quot; is an accurate evaluation by the people of his military leadership .
He wishes to blame everything on the lack of unification , but don &apos;t the facts contradict this , and aren &apos;t they all the results of his dictatorial &quot; unification &quot; ?
Let us look at it another way : It is true that he has not &quot; unified &quot; the entire country , but compared with him the Communist Party has &quot; unified &quot; the country even less .
Chiang possesses the political power of the Central Government and the greater part of China , while the Communist Party can only exert leadership over a small part of China .
Yet why is it that the Communist Party , in areas under its leadership , whether provinces , countries , districts , or towns , can introduce popular elections , reduce rent and interest , and develop production ?
The equipment and supplies of the troops led by the Communist Party were not good , yet they could persevere for 7 years on the frontline and repel the greater part of the enemy army and almost the entire puppet army .
It is because the Communist Party has &quot; unified &quot; the entire country while Chiang has not ?
Chiang says that the troops led by
the Communist Party are &quot; a tremendous disgrace and loss to the state . &quot; Does he mean that resisting the enemy and puppet troops was a tremendous disgrace and loss , while the army which disintegrated on contact , covered 1,000 li in one retreat , watched and avoided battles , tried to save the nation in a roundabout way , created a 1 @-@ million @-@ man puppet army , and even now coexists peacefully with the enemy and puppet troops and joins with them in resisting the communists is a tremendous glory and asset ?
In his speech Chiang censures the Communist Party for obstructing construction and preventing the people from living in peace and being content in their occupations , but why does he not permit the people to travel freely and compare and decide for themselves whether Yenan or Chungking , Peiping or Kalgan , are the areas in which the people can live in peace and be content in their occupations and pursue construction ?
The Communist Party vigorously strives to restore communications in peaceful areas , while Chiang , by means of the civil war , not only forces the Communist Party to destroy military communications in belligerent areas , but also disrupts the peaceful communications of nonbelligerent areas by blockading the Liberated Areas , of areas under his control by transporting troops , and of the Liberated Areas by bombing .
Then who is guilty of destroying communications ?
Do not all these facts indicate that Chiang &apos;s defense of his own crimes on the grounds of lack of &quot; unification &quot; is completely uncreditable ?
Moreover , in areas which were once liberated by the Communist Party but which have been occupied by the Kuomintang .authorities , areas which , according to Chiang &apos;s view , have been &quot; unified , &quot; the original political , economic , and military reforms have been cruelly destroyed under the &quot; unified &quot; control of his military and political commands and his corrupt officials , secret service agents , and evil unsurpers .
This situation is also common knowledge throughout the world .
Does it not indicate that all areas &quot; unified &quot; by Chiang and in which his followers faithfully implement his military and political commands are precisely the areas where no political , economic , or military reform can exist ?
To put it candidly , not only can the areas &quot; unified &quot; by Chiang not compare with the democratic autonomous areas built under the leadership of the Communist Party , but they are even inferior to areas under the control of those whom he has accused of being warlords .
On the grounds that Lung Yun was a warlord , Chiang expelled him from Yunnan by force in order to realize the &quot; unification &quot; of his military and political commands .
But look : What was the difference between Lung Yun &apos;s and Tu Yu @-@ ming &apos;s Yunnan ?
Didn &apos;t Chiang have to summarily dismiss Tu Yu @-@ ming by way of apology ?
After Tu was gone , Kuan Llng @-@ cheng took his place .
How did Kuan do in Yunnan ?
Didn &apos;t Chiang again have to summarily dismiss Kuan by way of apology ?
Even so , Lung Yun was not restored to his former position , while Tu Yu @-@ ming , upon leaving Yunnan , immediately proceeded to Liaoning and Jehol to &quot; unify &quot; the military and political commands in these areas .
Due to the bloody tragedy , unprecedented since the beginning of the Republic , which resulted from sending troops and police into the school , Kuan Ling @-@ cheng had to temporarily lie low .
Not only did he escape punishment according to the law , but he was awarded a &quot; loyalty medal . &quot; The conse-
quences of Chiang &apos;s military and political command in the so @-@ called recovered areas under &quot; unification &quot; furnish a particularly chilling lesson to the Chinese people .
Chiang &apos;s &quot; unification , &quot; in certain aspects , is not much different from the &quot; unification &quot; of the enemy and puppet troops , the people &apos;s living conditions are even harder than before , and even TA KUNG PAO , which is famous for supporting Chiang , has been forced to appeal loudly against &quot; losing all public support . &quot; Do these facts not indicate that , under Chiang &apos;s present methods , the greater the &quot; unifica- .
.
tion , &quot; the more tragic become democracy and the people &apos;s living conditions ?
These are the past and current conditions of the Chiang @-@ style &quot; unification . &quot; What about the future ?
Even according to Chiang &apos;s speech this time , the outcome will be merely one of calling a one @-@ party National Congress , a dictatorial congress .
All the &quot; delegates11 will be elected by coercion , bribery , proxy , or appointment , and it will be the ugliest congress in the history of the world and the Republic .
Through this dictatorial congress and through such a dictatorial constitution , Chiang promises an antiliberal and anticommunist &quot; popular government &quot; emulated by the world &apos;s fascists and copied by &quot; China &apos;s Destiny , &quot; the fascist classic of China .
Such will be the Chiang @-@ style &quot; democracy &quot; after the Chiang @-@ style &quot; unification . &quot; Can the Chinese people accept such &quot; unification &quot; and such &quot; democracy ? &quot; Like the people of foreign countries , the Chinese people naturally desire national unification .
But the unification desired by the Chinese people is unification which will protect the state and the people , a democratic unification .
Can such unification and Chiang &apos;s &quot; unification &quot; be discussed on the same level ?
The answer to the second question , whether China will be able to attain unification by means of this dictatorial method , is also in the negative .
Whether in foreign countries or in China , there was a historical period when &quot; unification &quot; of this kind could be accomplished , but that period has gone forever .
In China it has been at least 50 , if not 100 , years since such &quot; unification &quot; could be accomplished .
For the past 50 years the Chinese people , desiring freedom and independence , peace and prosperity , have always hoped for China &apos;s unificationa firm unification on .
the foundation of democracy .
Yet China &apos;s dictators invariably rejected it .
To perserve their dictatorship they always split with the people , though they then turned around and blamed the people for destroying &quot; unity . &quot; Since the time when the emperor in the last years of the Ch &apos;ing Dynasty blamed the &quot; autonomous troops &quot; organized by Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen for destroying his &quot; unification of military and political commands &quot; and attempted to perserve by force his own &quot; unification , &quot; the situation of division has never been fundamentally changed .
In his speech Chiang Kai @-@ shek asks the people not to &quot; sit on the sidelines and watch the nation repeat the mistakes of the early years of the Republic and sink into the desperate situation of division and collapse in the early years of the Republic ?
Even Chiang himself admitted that &quot; Yuan &apos;s usurpation.of the nation , the dangers of the Republic , and the inability of the citizenry to truly express its free will and demonstrate its strength created the
and unrest .
China &apos;s history of the past 50 years is thus filled with such civil wars created by the dictators .
But look : Has China been &quot; unified &quot; in the hands of the dictators ?
Or has it been divided ?
Are not all the divisions the outcome of the &quot; unification &quot; policy of the dictators ?
Dictatorial &quot; unification &quot; can only produce division .
Only be uniting with the democratic forces will unification be truly accomplished .
Had Tuan ChTi @-@ jui accepted Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s demands , or had Chiang Kai @-@ shek accepted the demands of the Communist Party , other democratic factions , and the people of the entire country , China &apos;s unification would have long been accomplished .
Chiang and his faction claim that the local autonomy of the Liberated Areas hampers unification , but isn &apos;t the people &apos;s election of their own government the fundamental law of all democratic nations in the world ?
Chiang himself declares that the political power will be returned to the people , but why does he wish to seize the power from the people in areas where the political power has been returned to them ?
When the people decide their own political orders on a local leve , why are such orders considered not unified ?
Does it mean that only when all 450 million people except one are deprived of their freedom of action will the political command be considered unified ?
Due to their refusal to recognize the people &apos;s commonplace rights to elect local governments and decide on local laws , Chiang and his faction have created the political division in China today .
They delude themselves with the idea of solving the political division by means of armed unification .
As a result , instead of armed unification , what they get is armed division .
Why is it an armed division ?
Because in the past 50 years the political strife between dictatorship and democracy has often led to military strife between the two .
Political dictators always rely on private , dictatorial armies to eliminate the democratic elements , forcing the politically democratic faction to create true nationals or popular , armies .
As they are compatible with the needs of history and the people , the national , or popular , armies , instead of being eliminated by the dictator , become ever more powerful .
Their main body today is the 8th Route Army and New 4th .
Army .
The Chinese people do not utilize these armies to seek division .
On the contrary , they utilize them to seek democratic unification .
Therefore , when the resistance war broke out , these troops became a part of the unified National Revolutionary Army .
Nevertheless , Chiang @-@ Kai @-@ shek , insisting on a private , dictatorial army , was unwilling to nationalize and popularize his own troops by following the example of these troops .
On the contrary , he refused to recognize the 8th Route Army and New 4th Army in fact and in law , maligning them as &quot; disloyal troops &quot; and &quot; bandit troops &quot; making all @-@ out efforts to &quot; encircle and exterminate &quot; them , thus creating today &apos;s armed division .
Since Chiang , by his own action , has proved that he follows the policy of division , proved that his armies are completely factional , private , and dictatorial , and refused to tolerate any national and popular troops , then , to assure the nationalization and popularization of China &apos;s troops , naturally , in the absence of a democratic coalition and a coalition command headquarters , the 8th Route Army and New 4th Army , as the nucleus of China &apos;s military reform , cannot be delivered to the dictatorship for extermination .
Such an action would be not only a reckless risk but also a crimea crime against China &apos;s military reform and democratic unification .
Since the Chinese people have firmly struggled for democratic unification for 50 years , and since they did not accept the dictatorial unification of the Manchus , or that of Yuan Shih @-@ k &apos;ai and Tuan Ch &apos;i @-@ jui , or that of Chiang Kai @-@ shek in the past 18 years , then if Chiang does not abandon his dictatorial policy today , even if he threatens continued civil war , such threats will not produce any &quot; unification . &quot; Therefore , not just politically , but also militarily , the history of the past 50 years has proved that China &apos;s unification can be accomplished only by walking the path of democratic unity , never the path of dictatorship .
In view of the above , Chiang &apos;s views cannot withstand the test of facts ; they contain no truth .
His &quot; unification &quot; will bring neither democracy nor unity to China .
On the contrary , only be acceding to the demands of the democratic parties and factions of China and the democratic powers of the world , calling a plenary Political Consultative Conference , stopping the civil war unconditionally , ending Chiang &apos;s one @-@ party , military , and personal dictatorship , and reorganizing the National Government into a democratic coalition government in which all democratic elements will enjoy extensive , fair , and effective representation will China attain democracy and unification .
Democracy is the cause and unification the effect ; stopping the civil war is the cause and restoring communications the effect ; political democratization is the cause and army nationalization the effect ; forming a democratic coalition government is the cause and creating a true National Congress the effect .
Is it conceivable that Chiang fails to understand such simple relations between cause and effect ?
Naturally he understands them .
That he intentionally reverses the cause and effect is merely for the purpose of seeking an excuse to preserve his dictatorship .
Actually , the Chinese people , like the world &apos;s democratic powers , have , since the peaceful solution of the Sian Incident , recognized the National Government as a convenient instrument for realizing democratic unification .
They never intended to overthrow this government and start something new .
Therefore , Chiang will retain a definite position , though absolutely not dictatorial position , in the reorganized National Government .
Chiang says that he &quot; cannot abandon his revolutionary responsibilities . &quot; We feel that sacrificing the personal and obeying the people , sacrificing dictatorship and obeying democracy , constitute his greatest responsibility toward the revolution .
His persistence in the policy of civil war after the end of the resistance war , as he himself stated , has actually led to the &quot; instant drop in the position of the state and the national glory gained through 8 years of bloody sacrifices &quot; and the danger of &quot; China becoming a scorned international straggler . &quot; Therefore , Byrnes , in his broadcast of 30.December , openly declared : &quot; China , divided by civil war , will not be able to take its proper position among the allies or efficiently perform its international obligations . &quot; Unfortunately , Chiang has , in his New Year speech , repeated his own past mistakes .
Nevertheless , the
direction of history has been determined .
No matter how much he and his faction resist , peace and democracy in China , with the firm struggle of the Chinese people and the sympathetic support of friendly democracies , will gain a decisive victory .
What we hope for are unity and unification .
Therefore , we still hope that Chiang and his faction will make good use of the opportunity , abandon their preconceived ideas , fully cooperate with all the democratic elements in China , and make the Political Consultative Conference successful , thereby enabling China to advance promptly on the bright highway of peaceful construction and .
regain its proper international position .

YENAN AUTHORITIES COMMENT ON THE GREAT SUCCESS OF THE POLITICAL CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE
1 February 1946
&#91; Text &#93; aSIK @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY , , Yenan , 1 Feb--The Political Consultative Conference closed successfully yesterday .
Yenan authorities commented :
The results gained by the Political Consultative Conference are very important .
The peaceful national construction program represents the common political program of the National Government after its reorganization and the general direction of democratic reforms to be followed by the entire nation in the transitional period .
The principle for revising the draft constitution determines the basic principle for the democratization of China &apos;s national political system hereafter , and the resolution on army reorganization provides the basic principle for the nationalisation of all the nation &apos;s armed forces , while the resolution on reorganizing the government and increasing the components of the National Congress constitutes the condition for safeguarding the implementation of the common program and the successful formulation and implementation of these resolutions , China will soon , on a nationwide scale , begin to leave the one @-@ party dictatorship of the state system .
Though all the resolutions still have to be implemented and , even after their implementation , a long @-@ term , tortuous process of struggle still has to be undergone before thorough democratization can be achieved , in order to overcome all kinds of difficulties and obstacles , China undoubtedly will hereafter enter the new stage of peaceful democratic construction , It is a great historical victory of ChinaTs democratic revolution .
, This victory is the result of the Chinese people &apos;s indomitable struggle in the past century and of the common efforts of the parties and factions and the substantial concessions they made .
The authorities point out that the excellent resolutions are merely the inception and that everything hinges on their concrete and faithful implementation .
Always faithful to its promises , the Chinese Communist Party will thoroughly implement all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference in the Liberated Areas and among the troops in these areas with the most sincere attitude .
All members of the Chinese Communist Party will devote their efforts to
peaceful and legitimate struggle throughout the nation for the thorough demonetization of the state and the construction of an independent , free , and powerful new China .
The Chinese Communist Party welcomes Chairman Chiang &apos;s promise to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the program of peaceful national construction , and it hopes that the Kuomintang will follow this spirit and pursue long @-@ term cooperation with the people of the entire nation and the parties and factions , so that all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference will be completely realized .

STATEMENT OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE SPOKESMAN OF 17 MARCH
17 March 1946
&#91; Text &#93; Many influential persons In the Kuomintang are currently attempting to revise certain fundamental resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference , especially the one of the principle of the constitution .
They will not have the consent of the Chinese Communist Party , other democratic parties and factions , and the broad masses for their action .
The resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference are the result of the joint discussions and unanimous agreement of the plenary representatives of the various parties and factions .
Everything they decided is compatible with the needs of the state and the hopes of the people .
The resolution on the principle of the constitution , in particular , has won the support of international and domestic public opinion , which sees it as the only way to lay the foundation for democratization of the state .
National Government Chairman Chiang personally served as chairman of the Political Consultative Conference .
In his closing speech on 31 January , he declared solemnly that &quot; as regards the resolutions adopted by the Political Consultative Conference , although I was unable to participate In them , I constantly studied them and gave them my attention , and I found that their entire contents were the crystallization of the sincere discussions of everyone concerned .
On behalf of the government I wish to announce in advance that the government will respect the resolutions .
As soon as the procedures are formulated , they will be implemented as decided . &quot; That the Kuomintang should suddenly propose revisions of the resolutions , including the principle of the constitution , just barely 1 1 / 2 months after the close of the conference is truly surprising .
The Chinese Communist Party pays serious attention to the promises of Chiang Kai @-@ shek and the Kuomintang and feels that the political honor of the various political parties and the long @-@ range plan of the state are linked with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference .
Therefore , it will never waver but will adhere to all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference , especially the resolution on the principle of the constitution , which must be implemented 100 percent .
It opposes any
revision and appeals to all the democratic figures and the people of the entire nation to be ready to wage a solemn struggle for this sacred task .

REFUTE CHIANG KAI @-@ SHEK 6 April 1946
&#91; Text &#91; On 1 April National Government Chairman Chiang Kai @-@ shek made a long political report to the People &apos;s Political Council , which was organized exclusively by the fascists in the Kuomintang and which the Chinese Communist Party refused to attend .
The CENTRAL .
NEWS AGENCY on 3 and 4 April distributed the &quot; essential points &quot; of the 6,000 @-@ word report .
According to the CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY , there are two genuine &quot; essential points &quot; in Chiang Kai @-@ shekfs report : One is to tear up the Northeast cease @-@ fire and again declare a large @-@ scale civil war to the whole nation ; the other is to tear up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and again declare dictatorship to the whole nation and attempt to gain constitutional sanction by means of the National Congress .
Concerning the first point , Chiang Kai @-@ shek said : &quot; Until the assumption of sovereignty over the nine Northeast provinces is completed , there is no internal political issue to speak of . &quot; He also said : &quot; The handling of military conflicts will be carried out on the premise that it does not affect the assumption of sovereignty and the exercise of state administrative power by the government . &quot; Here he successively tears up two promises : First , he calls the action of his army in allying with the enemy and the puppets , attacking the Northeast democratic allied army , and slaughtering the people of the Northeast , not military conflict , but &quot; assuming sovereignty and exercising state administrative power , &quot; thereby tearing up his promise in the Northeast cease @-@ fire agreement that the executive team must &quot; proceed to the point of conflict or close contact between the government and the Chinese Communist armies , stop the conflict , and make the necessary and fair adjustment and disposal , &quot; Next , after overthrowing the local autonomous government of the people of the Northeast and spreading his terrorist fascist control , he said that &quot; there is no internal political issue to speak of , &quot; thereby tearing up his promise in the Northeast cease @-@ fire agreement that &quot; the political issues will be discussed separately and solved promptly . &quot; Here Chiang Kai @-@ shek reveals his ferocious bloodthirsty features , making a sickening hypocrisy of his statement that &quot; in view of the miseries suffered by the area , it is hoped
that the Military Mediation Executive Department will carefully select and send an executive team to the Northeast to stop the military conflicts . &quot; As the whole world knows , the Chinese Communist Party was the one which persistently demanded that the Military Mediation Executive Department stop the military conflict in the Northeast .
Chiang Kai @-@ shek and his group vigorously opposed the Northeast cease @-@ fire and announced time and again that the Northeast was not within the scope of military mediation .
At the press conference for foreign correspondents on 20 February his spokesman unequivocally answered the question of a foreign reporter : &quot; Question : Is the Northeast included in the functional scope of the Peiping Military Mediation Executive Department ?
Answer : No .
The Northeast is not included . &quot; This was officially published by the CENTRAL NEWS .
AGENCY in its 20 February dispatch from Chungking and cannot be changed by any Tie .
Only after the Chinese Communist Party , based on the clear provision in the cease @-@ fire agreement that all military conflicts must cease in the entire nation , urged Chiang Kai @-@ shek time and again to recognize the cease @-@ fire did he accept , on 27 March , with utmost insincerity , the Northeast ceasefire agreement .
Yet , barely 5 days later , in his speech of 1 April , he promptly and openly tore it up .
He called the vicious civil war waged by him in the Northeast with foreign rockets and tanks against our countrymen &quot; assuming sovereignty and exercising state administrative power . &quot; Naturally , it will not earn the forgiveness of the people of the Northeast , because no matter how ingenious the slogan of the executioner , it will not help them escape death from the foreign rockets and tanks .
Furthermore , the Chinese people well remember that Chiang Kai @-@ shek , in regard to the civil war in any area , always declared that it was for the purpose of &quot; assuming sovereignty &quot; and &quot; exercising state administrative power , &quot; and in regard to any local government organized by the Chinese people after recovering state sovereignty from the Japanese aggressors , he announced that &quot; the assumption of sovereignyt has not been completed . &quot; According to him , the sovereignty of the Republic of China does not belong to the people but to him and his group .
Therefore , only his dictatorial political regime can assume the sovereignty , while the people and all democratic parties and factions have absolutely nothing to say .
If they do , it is called &quot; threatening peace in the Far East and world security , &quot; as if the Far East and the world were his private property and the friendly nations his private retainers .
The Chinese people also well remember that , when Japan occupied the Northeast and large areas of North , Central , and South China , Chiang Kai @-@ shek was never in a hurry to defend the state sovereignty against the Japanese .
What he did in the 14 years from the 18 September Incident to Japan &apos;s surrender can be summer up in one phrase : Retreating from Heilungkiang to Kweichow Province .
During those difficult and .dangerous months and years , the troops under his command were like a compass , always running south .
He ran for far south that even today he is still sending large numbers of troops from Vietnam , Yunna , Kweichow , Kwangsi , and Kwangtung northward , while criticizing the Communist Party , which persevered in the resistance war in the Northeast and North China , for confronting him .
What is especially shameful is that he has completely
disregarded his reputation and fabricated the ridiculous &quot; history &quot; of the Kuomintang &apos;s perseverance in the resistance war in the Northeast .
Feigning forgetfulness , he acts as though he had never adhered to the principle of nonresistance to Japan or subscribed to Sino @-@ Japanese amity from the time of the 18 September Incident until he was detained by Chang Hsueh @-@ liang , who is himself under detention to this day .
To refresh his memory , we urge him to review his past performance , and we will cite a few foul instances here .
On 7 April 1933 , in his speech entitled &quot; A Study of the Most Recent Bandit Exterminating Tactics &quot; to high @-@ level officers of the Middle Route Army of the &quot; Bandit Extermination Army &quot; in Kiangsi &apos;s Fu @-@ chou , he said : &quot; The enemy of our revolution is not the Japanese bandits but the native bandits .
The Three Eastern Provinces and Jehol were lost .
Naturally , as they were lost under the nominally unified government , we must take the responsibility , Nevertheless , from the standpoint of the revolution , the loss was not very important .
The revolutionary party cannot be responsible for Japan &apos;s occupation of the Three Eastern Provinces and Jehol .
Their loss is not detrimental to the revolution .
If at this time we concentrate on the high and the distant and brag about resisting Japan , while failing to seek the truth through the facts and to eliminate the bandits , it will amount to speculation and taking the easy way out , and we will lose the essence of revolutionary soldiers . &quot; This passage appears on pages 75 @-@ 77 of &quot; Theory arid Practice of Bandit Extermination , &quot; published in July 1935 by the Propaganda Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Central Executive Committee .
In his speech in July 1934 entitled &quot; resisting Foreign Aggression and Rebuilding the Nation , &quot; delivered to the Lu @-@ shan Officers Training Corps , Chiang Kai @-@ shek said : &quot; By what means can we resist the enemy and rebuild the nation ?
Will we be able to fight the enemy by concentrating all our efforts on national defense and the manufacture of airplanes and cannons ?
The officers must know that not only is it already too late for us to acquire weapons and reorganize national defense and impossible to resist the enemy , but even If we all concentrate on these tasks for the next 30 years the effort will be inadequate .
Then by what means can we reorganize the national defense ?
By what means can we truly fight the enemy ?
There Is no such time !
No such possibility !
We must stop dreaming !
We can say that the life of our state and the life of our nation are now in the hands of the Japanese , and there is no room for any free action ! &quot; This speech was printed as a monograph , published in 1938 In all the Kuomintang papers in the country , and included in the &quot; Selections of Committee Chairman Chiang &apos;s Instructions &quot; ( pages 431 @-@ 432 , Volume 1 ) edited by the office of his aides .
In September 1935 Chiang Kai @-@ shek published an article entitled &quot; Changes in Sino @-@ Japanese Relations &quot; in the Japanese magazine KEIZAI ORAL He said : &quot; Viewed from whatever aspect , China and Japan must help each other and cooperate in order to promote prosperity in Asia .
Though we are in the midst of serious difficulties today , we think of the long history of Sino @-@ Japanese relations in the past and firmly believe that the current disputes will be solved by the sincerity and efforts of the people of the two nations and that true cooperation and amity , which are our constant ideal , will be realized . &quot; This passage appears on pages 69 @-@ 70 of the third
edition of &quot; Complete Works of Committee Chairman Chiang &quot; published by the Shanghai Kuo @-@ t &apos;ai Bookstore .
After the start of the resistance war , Chiang Kai @-@ shek , on 18 November 1939 , gave a speech entitled &quot; China &apos;s Resistance War and the International Situation &quot; at the sixth meeting of the sixth central plenum of the fifth session of the Kuomintang .
He said : &quot; Just what do we mean by resisting to the end ?
I explained at the fifth central plenum that resisting to the end and recovering the status quo prior to the 7 July Incident were based on China as the criterion . &quot; These words are found on page 16 , Volume 5 , of &quot; Selections of Committee Chairman Chiang &apos;s Instructions &quot; edited by the office of his aides .
Just these random data alone are sufficient to prove that Chiang and his accomplices were guilty of losing the Northeast and had no merit in its recovery .
Naturally , one day Chiang Kai @-@ shek will destroy or revise these masterpieces of his so that even kindergarten children will believe that the fable In his 1 April speech is true , that he never ordered nonresistance or Sino @-@ Japanese amity after the 18 September Incident , , that he never signed the Shanghai Agreement , the T &apos;ang @-@ ku Agreement , the China @-@ Manchuria Traffic and Postal Agreement , or the Ho @-@ Umezu Agreement , that he never pursued any diplomatic activities to betray the Northeast and seek surrender and compromise after the start of the.resistance war , and that he never charged the puppet army in the Northeast and the Japanese fascist remnants with &quot; assuming sovereignty over the Northeast . &quot; Unfortunately , he has not yet had time to accomplish all these .
He created the rumor that no Chinese Communist troops were present in the Northeast before Japan &apos;s surrender .
It has only served to prove the absence of any national concept in him , because no Chinese with any national concept will be so callous as to obliterate the more than a decade of courageous history of the world @-@ famous Northeast resist @-@ Japan allied army , or the 8 years of courageous history of the world @-@ famous Hopeh @-@ Jehol @-@ Llaoning Border Region , or the courageous history of the units of Li Yun @-@ ch &apos;ang , Lu Cheng @-@ ts &apos;ao , Wan Yi , and Chang Hsueh @-@ shih , part of the 8th Route Army , which entered the Northeast under orders of 11 August before Japan &apos;s surrender , reinforced the anti @-@ Japanese allied army and the Hopeh @-@ Jehol @-@ Liaoning Border Region , aided the Soviet Red Army to eliminate the enemy and puppet troops in the Northeast , liberated the people of the Northeast , and recovered national sovereignty .
That Chiang Kai @-@ shek , as chairman of the National Government , did not hesitate to create rumors for the selfish purpose of one party , one faction , and one individual has truly embarrassed the Chinese people .
&quot; according to law , &quot; the people of all freedoms ( Articles 8 @-@ 10 , 12 @-@ 16 , 18 , and 27 of the Provisional Constitution ) on .
the one hand , and , on the other hand , brazenly decided on a one @-@ party dictatorship by announcing that &quot; in the political tutelage period the Chinese Kuomintang National Party Congress will exercise the ruling power of the Central Government on behalf of the National Congress , &quot; and that &quot; when the Chinese Kuomintang National Party Congress is not in session , its functions will be performed by the Chinese Kuomintang Central Executive Committee &quot; ( Article 30 of the Provisional Constitution ) .
Article 15 of the Organization Law of the National Government formulated under the Provisional Constitution provides : &quot; The presidents and vice presidents of the five yuan of the National Government will be nominated by the chairman of the National Government from among the National Government Committee members for selection and appointment by the Chinese Kuomintang Central Executive Committee .
The National Government chairman will be responsible to the Chinese Kuomintang Central Executive Committee , and the presidents of the five yuan to the National Government chairman . &quot; Here the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee is the only supreme organ of power of the state , and each of its members , according to the decision of the first central plenum of the sixth session of the Kuomintang , must swear that he &quot; will obey the orders of the director general with the utmost sincerity and will be willing to suffer the most severe punishment of the party if the oath is violated . &quot; Thus , the so @-@ called &quot; fundamental law of the state &quot; is : The people of the whole country must , &quot; according to law , &quot; obey the National Government , the National Government must obey its chairman , Chiang Kai @-@ shek , the chairman must obey the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee , and every member of the committee must swear to obey Chairman Chiang Kai @-@ shek with the utmost sincerity .
In other words , the people of the whole country must serve as fourth @-@ class slaves of Chiang Kai @-@ shekTs personal dictatorship !
Chiang Kai @-@ shek , in his speech of 1 April , asks the people of the whole country to continue to recognize the inviolable Provisional Constitution of the political tutelage period and the Organization Law of the National Government , and he asks the democratic parties and factions to join his National Government on this basis , so that the &quot; transitional stage &quot; of the &quot; most efficient &quot; fascist political tutelage will &quot; transit &quot; to his fascist constitutional politics ; otherwise , his government &quot; absolutely will not recognize &quot; the Political Consultative Conference , because , in his view , without fascism &quot; the country will sink into an anarchic state ! &quot; His insistence on maintaining the fascist dictatorship at present naturally is not merely for the 1 month of legal control before 5 May , but for the continued preservation of this dictatorship into the distant future .
This conspiracy has been clearly expressed in his theory on the constitutional issue .
He and his group insist on overthrowing the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference on the principle of the draft constitution , describing the resolution as a &quot; reference &quot; document without any binding force on Chiang Kai @-@ shek and the Kuomintang , which unanimously rose and voted for its passage at the Political Consultative Conference .
Chiang Kai @-@ shek and his group violate tbe resolution of the conference , insist that the constitution
must take the national construction program as &quot; the most fundamental basis , &quot; firmly oppose a congress as the supreme organ of power , insist that the congress ( Legislative Yuan ) must possess no powers of consent and nonconfi @-@ dence in the cabinet ( Executive Yuan ) , insist that neither must the Supervisory Yuan have the power of consent , and insist that the provinces have no need to formulate provincial constitutions as advocated by Dr Sun Yat @-@ seh .
Yet he maintains that .these stands reflect his &quot; determination to sincerely abide by and vigorously carry out &quot; the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and his &quot; assiduity in being tolerant and yielding and doing the best possible under the circumstances . &quot; His dictionary is so different from ordinary ones !
The five principles of the second central plenum of the Kuomintang he firmly follows are apparently all for the purpose of opposing the &quot; most distressing &quot; parliamentary politics , so that , by means of the unlimited concentration of power in the Executive Yuan and the meaningless ornament of the National Congress , he will not be restricted by the Legislative Yuan and the Supervisory Yuan or by the provinces , but will forever maintain the fascist dictatorship , &quot; the most efficient in ruling in the evolutionary stage . &quot; There is no other significance .
Right from the start the fascist reactionaries in the Kuomintang opposed the cease @-@ fire agreement , the Political Consultative Conference , and the army reorganization plan , yet these achievements were all won by overcoming the fascist reactionaries .
Therefore , the vigorous attempt of the fascist reactionaries to subsequently overthrow the agreements is not in the least bit surprising .
What is worthy of attention is that Chiang Kai @-@ shelc , during one period in the past , expressed his support of these agreements , yet now he personally takes the standpoint of the fascist reactionaries to attack and tear them up .
The fascist reactionaries feel that this reaction may win certain international aid ; therefore , they send large numbers of troop reinforcements to the Northeast , recklessly expand the war , and launch serious provocations in other areas of the nation , such as central Hopeh , northern Kiangsu , Shansi , and northern Honan , not only not restoring communications but openly building fortresses , not only disbanding the puppet army but openly continuing to recruit puppet troops .
They continue to use armed enemy troops in Shansi , not only not demoblizing them but openly declaring that &quot; demoblization is the beginning of moblization , &quot; announcing that a nationwide civil war will be launched in the next few months , and completely ignoring the Peiping Executive Department and the three @-@ man committee .
In politics they recklessly destroy all resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference , continue to spread terror throughout the nation , conspire to murder important political prisoners , openly commend the &quot; abundant merits and great achievements &quot; of the vicious secret service organ , and especially openly demand the passage of the dictatorial constitution by the National Congress , so that China will return to the status prior to January this year .
This situation cannot but arouse the vigorous vigilance of the people of the entire nation .
The Chinese people cannot but warn Chiang Kai @-@ shek and the fascist reactionaries at this critical moment : You feel that you were forced by
international pressure to accept the cease @-@ fire agreement and the resolutions and army reorganization plan of the Political Consultative Conference and that , with the temporary relaxation of this pressure , you can resume your old ways .
You are wrong , not only because you have not truly recognised the international situation , but also because you have not made an adequate assessment of the people &apos;s power .
To resist troop reinforcements in the Northeast , to stop the civil war in the Northeast and other areas , to preserve the democratic rights of the people of the Northeast and the entire nation , to end the dictatorial political tutelage , i.e. , the one @-@ party dictatorship of the Kuomintang , to seek full implementation of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions , to insist on a democratic constitution , i.e. , the plenary powers o the congress , the consent and nonconfidence powers of the Legislative Yuan over the Executive Yuan , the consent power of the Supervisory Yuan , and the right of the provinces to formulate their own constitutions which do not conflict with the national constitution and cannot be changed by the laws of the Central Government , and to insist on the thorough reduction and nationalization of the Kuomintang troops , the Chinese people have determined to launch an indomitable struggle .
All these goals are linked with the Chinese people &apos;s fundamental interests , and the people will absolutely refuse to yield .
Peace and democracy in China have been basically won by the struggles of the Chinese people and are not a gift from any Chinese or foreigners , while the things won through struggle can only , and will definitely , be preserved and consolidated by continuous struggles .
If the fascist reactionaries persist in their reactionisra to the bitter end , then the Chinese people know how to handle the matter correctly .

&#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY . , Yenan , 16 JunCertain American authorities have ignored the appeal of the Chinese people and the democratic parties and factions to stop fostering China &apos;s civil war and have decided to render military aid to its instigatorsthe Chiang Kai @-@ shek government .
According to a Washington dispatch of a U.S.
news service dated the 14th , &quot; U.S.
Secretary of State Byrnes today ( 14th ) submitted a bill to the Senate for its approval providing for military training and technical aid to China .
In a letter accompanying the bill , Byrnes pointed out that &apos; uninterrupted military aid to China is extremely important . &apos; He said : &apos; China asked the United States to send a military mission to China of the same nature as the American military delegation sent to Latin America . &apos; The bill for military aid to China was jointly prepared by the departments of the army , navy , and state .
Byrnes felt that the national interest ( including the U.S.
interest in reconstruction and in maintaining peace and security in Asia ) requires that America render aid to China and organize and maintain a suitable number of modern troops , so that China will make its contribution to such peace and security . &quot; The people here feel that , just when the Chinese Communist delegates in Nanking , through Marshall , are negotiating and striving for a general and long @-@ term peace in China with the Kuomintang government , while the latter openly advocates a general long @-@ term civil war , this bill encouraging China &apos;s civil war proposed by the U.S.
Government is truly an unfriendly gesture toward the Chinese people in their desire for peace .
The facts and Byrnes &apos; inferences are completely contradictory .
If this bill is passed , China will sink into a serious situation of discord and insecurity , while the interests of the American people and the prestige of the American nation will suffer a tremendous loss .
As Chinese and world public opinion has pointed out time and again , America &apos;s huge military aid to the warmongering dictatorial government of the Chinese Kuomintang is the only fundamental cause of the inception , expansion , and unrestraint of China &apos;s civil war today .
The Chinese people do not understand what right the American government has to forcefully impose civil war and dictatorship on China and to demand that China , like Latin America , be degraded to a part of the American sphere of influence or its &quot; national
interest . &quot; Nor do they understand what right the American government has to destroy President Truman &apos;s declaration of last December about &quot; not influencing the process of any internal dispute in China by military intervention &quot; arid the principles contained in the official report on the China issue of the Moscow three @-@ nation foreign ministers conference last December .
The Yenan authorities indicate that peace and democracy in China are sacred rights of the Chinese people which no one may interfere with or alienate and that , if the reactionaries of China rely on foreign aid , persist in civil war and dictatorship , directly turn the present Kuomintang government into a ChTin Kuai , Chang Fang @-@ ch &apos;ang , or Liu Yu government , and make the present National Government chairman a subservient emperor paying homage to foreign countries , we can definitely say that the Chinese people will resist to the last drop of their blood .

STATEMENT ON U.S.
CHINA @-@ AID BILL 22 June 1946
&#91; Text &#93; The bill providing continued military aid to China submitted by the U.S.
secretary of state on the 14th is most favorable to the peace , security , independence and democracy of China .
Therefore , the Chinese Communist Party firmly opposes it .
This view is supported by the broad democratic masses of China .
In the war to resist Japan , when America rendered military aid to China and sent troops to Chinese territory to coordinate with China in combat , the goal was to defeat the common enemy of China and America Japanese imperialism .
However , even at that time , since America erroneously rendered aid only to the Kuomintang warlords , such aid did not effectively reinforce China &apos;s resistance .
On the contrary , it was used by the Kuomintang warlords to reinforce their attack on and blockade of the Chinese Communist Party and the Liberated Areas which actively resisted Japan .
After Japan surrendered , America , instead of discontinuing , greatly strengthened all types of military aid to the Chinese Kuomintang government and , with this precise goal , send hordes of troops to be stationed on China &apos;s territorial land and seas .
Its action has been proved to be the fundamental cause of the outbreak and continuous escalation of China &apos;s civil war .
Only on the premise of the U.S.
government &apos;s assertion that it would abide by the restrictions on the China issue contained in the official report of the Moscow three @-@ nation foreign ministers conference of December 1945 and the Chinese Kuomintang &apos;s declaration that it would stop the civil war and implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference on state democratization did the Chinese Communist Party agree on certain kinds of U.S.
military aid to China .
However , now that this premise has been seriously damaged , the so @-@ called military aid rendered by America is actually only armed intervention in China &apos;s internal affairs ; it represents only vigorous support of the Kuomintang dictatorial government and an effort to keep China in a situation of civil war , division , chaos , terror , and poverty ; it is intended only to prevent China from implementing army reorganization and demobilization and performing its obligations to the United Nations ; it is intended only to endanger China &apos;s national security and independence and its territorial sovereignty ; it is designed only to destroy the
glorious friendship between the two great nations of China and America and the future of their trade .
What the Chinese people urgently need today is not American guns and cannons or American garrisons on Chinese territory .
On the contrary , the Chinese people deeply feel that the ammunition shipped by America to China is excessive , that the American forces stationed in China are too large , and that they have created a tremendous threat to the peace and security of China and the survival and freedom of the Chinese people .
In these realistic conditions , the Chinese Communist Party cannot but firmly oppose the American Government &apos;s continued delivery of arms to the Kuomintang government of China in the form of sales , lease , gifts , or assignment ; it firmly opposes the sending of an American military advisory mission to China and firmly demands that America immediately cease and recover all the so @-@ called military aid to China and immediately withdraw all its troops from China .

NEW YEAR MESSAGE 1 January 1947
&#91; Text &#93; In 1946 the bright side of the postwar world waged a successful struggle against its dark side , and the bright side of postwar China also waged a successful struggle against its dark side .
A large @-@ scale people &apos;s movement for peace , democracy , and freedom has developed in both the postwar world and postwar China .
This movement will inevitably march toward victory , and no force can resist it .
Nevertheless , the reactionaries will always attempt to block it .
The task of the whole world and all of China is to rally all forces and smash the resistance of the reactionaries .
In 1947 the world united front of the people of all nations in the world , including China , against America &apos;s policy of aggression will develop rapidly , while the movement of the Chinese people for democracy and freedom will gain greater victories than in 1946 .
As a result , changes will occur in the situation in China which are favorable to the resumption of peace and the independence of the nation .
Even during the resistance war period our Communist Party members strove for the postwar cooperation of all the parties and factions .
However , we also issued a warning : &quot; The major ruling group of the Kuomintang , under the camouflage of the &apos; National Congress &apos; and &apos; political solution , 1 Is now surreptitiously preparing for a civil war .
If our countrymen do not pay attention , expose its conspiracy , and block its preparations , they will wake up one morning and hear the artillery fire of the civil war . &quot; After the conclusion of the resistance war , together with the people of the whole nation , we exhausted all our patience and efforts to stop the outbreak and escalation of a civil war .
Unfortunately , these efforts were destroyed by the general attack launched by the reactionaries and the &quot; National Congress &quot; controlled exclusively by the Kuomintang .
However , the Chinese people continue to seek peace through two kinds of effortthe arduous and outstanding struggle of the people of all classes and strata in the Liberated Areas against the reactionary attacks , and the ever @-@ rising mass movement of the people of all classes and strata In the areas under Kuomintang control for democracy and freedom .
This combined desire of the Chinese people will definitely overpower that of any reactionary element ,
thereby making possible sincere discussions for peace among all the parties and factions and a genuine peaceful life throughout the nation .
Currently the Kuomintang authorities are not showing the least bit of interest in peace .
Instigated by the American Government , they are busily adorning themselves with the divided &quot; National Congress &quot; and the dictatorial &quot; constitution &quot; in order to &quot; legalize &quot; their war and American aid .
Nevertheless , as long as the people of the whole nation unite and persevere in an indomitable struggle , the sunlight of freedom will , in the near future , shine on the great land of our mother country , and an independent , peaceful , and democratic new China will have a firm foundation .

CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY AUTHORITIES ON CURRENT SITUATION 30 May 1947
&#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY , North Shensi , 30 MayChinese Communist Party authorities expressed their views on the current situation to HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY reporters .
They said :
The Chiang Kal @-@ shek government , the enemy of the people , has now discovered that it is besieged by the entire population .
Whether on the military or the political front , it has suffered defeats , is besieged by the might of the people , whom it has declared an enemy , and can find no way of escape .
Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s traitorous group and its master , American imperialism , have made a wrong assessment of the situation .
They overestimated their own strength and underestimated the people &apos;s strength .
They regarded postwar China and the world as the same as in the past , not permitting changes in the pattern of anything and not permitting anyone to disobey their will .
After Japan &apos;s surrender they were determined to restote China to the old order .
Gaining time by means of such deceptions as the Political Consultative Conference and military mediation , Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s traitorous government mobilized 2 million troops and launched a general attack .
The Chinese Communist authorities said that the war between Chiang Kai @-@ shekTs aggressive army and the People &apos;s Liberation Army is the first front , and now a second front has appearedthe sharp struggle between the great and just student movement and Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s reactionary government .
The slogan of the student movement is food , peace , and freedom , i.e. , against starvation , against civil war , and against oppression .
Chiang Kai @-@ shek has promulgated a provisional method to maintain social order .
His army , police , military police , and secret service clash with the student masses everywhere .
He handles the empty @-@ handed students by such forceful means as arrests , imprisonment , heatings , and slaughtering , yet the student movement spreads daily .
All social sympathy is on the side of the students , while Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s ferocious features have been starkly revealed .
The student movement is part of the people &apos;s movement and its organizer .
The rise of the student movement will inevitably lead to the rise of the entire people &apos;s movement .
This has been pointed out in the historical experiences of the 4 May and 29 January movements of the past .
As American imperialism
and its running dog Chiang Kai @-@ shek have replaced Japanese imperialism and its running dog Wang Ching ^ wei and adopted the policies of turning China into an American colony , launching a civil war , and reinforcing the fascist dictatorial control , they have declared war against the people of the entire nation and pushed the people of all classes and strata to the verge of starvation and death .
Therefore , they have forced the people to unite and wage a life @-@ and @-@ death struggle against Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s reactionary government and to make this struggle develop rapidly .
There is no other way out .
The people of all classes and strata in China , including workers , peasants , the petty bourgeoisie , the national bourgeoisie , the enlightened gentry , other patriotic elements , minorities , and Overseas Chinese , oppressed by the reactionary policies of the Chiang Kai @-@ shek government and finding themselves in a situation calling for unity and self @-@ help , constitute an extremely large national united front .
The Chinese Communist authorities said that the reactionary financial and economic policies long followed by the Chiang Kai @-@ shek government have now been reinforced by an unprecedented traitorous treatythe Sino @-@ American trade treaty .
On the foundation of this treaty , America &apos;s monopolistic capital will closely associate with Chiang Kai @-@ shek1s bureaucratic compradore capital and control the economic life of the entire nation .
As a result , it will cause extreme currency inflation , unprecedented commodity price increases , growing bankruptcy or national industry and commerce , and ever @-@ deteriorating living standards of the laboring masses and public and educational personnel .
This situation has forced the people of all classes and strata to unite and struggle for their lives .
The Chinese Communist authorities pointed out that military suppression and political deception are the two main tools employed by Chiang Kai @-@ shek to preserve his reactionary control .
Now the people have realized the rapid advance of these tools toward bankruptcy .
Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s troops have suffered defeats everywhere since last July .
Over 90 brigades of his regular troops alone have been wiped out .
Not only do they no longer have the vitality they demonstrated when they captured Ch &apos;ang @-@ ch &apos;un , Ch &apos;eng @-@ te , Kalgan , Ko @-@ tse , Huai @-@ yin , and An @-@ tung last year , but not even that of the time when they occupied Lin @-@ i and Yenan this year .
Chiang Kai @-@ shek and Ch &apos;en Ch &apos;eng erroneously estimated the strength and the operational methods of the People &apos;s Liberation Army , taking withdrawal as cowardice and the abandonment of cities as failure .
They wishfully thought to solve the problem inside the pass in 3 to 6 months before solving the Northeast issue .
But 10 months later Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s entire aggressive army has fallen into a desperate situation , facing waves of attack by the people and the People &apos;s Liberation Army of the Liberated Areas and finding it difficult to escape .
More and more reports of the defeat of Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s troops on the frontline arrive at the rear , and the broad masses , suffocating under the oppression of Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s reactionary government , feel ever more hopeful about a change in their fate .
Precisely at this time , all of Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s political deceptions are rapidly going bankrupt .
Everything has turned out contrary to the expectations of the reactionaries , such as calling a National Congress to formulate a constitution , reorganizing the one @-@ party
government into a multiparty government , etc .
Their goal was to isolate the Chinese Communist Party and all democratic forces , but the result has been otherwise .
Rather than the Chinese Communist Party or the democratic forces , the reactionaries themselves have been isolated .
Henceforth the Chinese people know , from their own experience , the truth of Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s National Congress , his constitution , and his multiparty government .
Until now many Chinese people , mainly the middle classes and strata , entertained some illusions about Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s sleights of hand and his talk of peace .
After he had torn to shreds several solemn cease @-@ fire agreements , and after bayonets had been pointed at the student masses demanding peace and resisting the civil war , with the exception of those who intentionally wish to deceive or those without the least bit of political experience , no one will believe his peace talk .
The Chinese Communist authorities said : All the changes have proved the accuracy of our assessment .
We have constantly pointed out to the people that the Chiang Kai @-@ shek government is nothing but a government of treachery , civil war , and dictatorship .
It wishes to smash the Chinese Communist Party and all democratic forces by means of a civil war in order to attain its goal of turning China into an American colony and preserving its dictatorial control .
Nevertheless , because of these reactionary policies it has lost all its political prestige and strength .
The power of the Chiang Kai @-@ shek government is merely temporary and superficial .
Actually , it is a government with a powerful exterior and an empty interior .
Regardless of the area and the front , its attacks can be repelled .
In the future it will inevitably lose all its supporters and its entire array .
All the changes have proved , and will continue to prove , the accuracy of our assessments .
The Chinese Communist authorities said : The development of the changes in China has been more rapid than anticipated .
The speed of the victories of the People &apos;s Liberation Army on the one had and the progress of the people &apos;s struggle in areas under Chiang &apos;s control on the other have been very rapid .
To realize a peaceful , democratic , and independent new China , the Chinese people must prepare all the required conditions .

&#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY , North Shensi , 13 JulA HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY reporter commented on tne current situation :
On the 4th of this month Chiang Kai @-@ shek personally proposed to what the Kuomintang calls the &quot; three @-@ party government &quot; the so @-@ called general mobilization resolution , and it was passed .
This resolution has proved two things to the people of the whole country for the last time : First , the ringleader of the civil war is Chiang Kai @-@ shek .
Second , since the Chungking Parade Ground tragedy last year , the series of violent fascist outrages by the Kuomintang secret service agents , the violation of the cease @-@ fire agreement of 10 Jaunary 1946 , the civil war , the treacherous SIno @-@ Araerican trade treaty , the massacre of our countrymen with American weapons , the recruitment of Japanese war criminal Okamura Neiji to participate in the civil war , the coercive conscription , the grain levy and fund collections everywhere , the violation of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions , the counterfeit National Congress , the counterfeit constitution , the ousting of Chinese Communist delegates , the occupation of Yenan , and the arrests and massacres of students , reporters , and democratic figures who are against the civil war , starvation , dictatorship , and betrayal have all been initiated by Chiang Kai @-@ shek .
All his perversions are in the interest of American imperialism and China &apos;s reactionaries , bringing calamity and death to the Chinese people .
His general mobilization is his general collapse .
The general mobilization will not avert his military , economic , and political crises ; on the contrary , it will only aggravate them .
His collapse is unavoidable .
Due to his general mobilization , the people of the whole country are faced with greater and deeper calamities , and they realize ever more clearly that Chiang Kai @-@ shek Is the source of the calamities .
As long as Ch &apos;ing @-@ fu existed , the calamities of Lu would not cease .
As long as traitor Chiang is not eliminated , the
country will have no peace .
To avoid the calamities , any Chinese has the right to punish this civil war ringleader and traitor .
The faithful disciples of Sun Yat @-@ sen in the Kuomintang must unite and , together with the people , punish the renegade .
If they have the least bit of conscience , those in power in the Kuomintang must arrest him , denounce his crimes of betraying the country and showering calamities on the people , and .
bring him to trial by the people .

COMMENTS BY &apos;HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY1 REPORTER ON U.S.
CRIME TO RUIN CHINA AND THE DUET SUNG BY PROCURESS AND PROSTITUTE
30 August 1947
&#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY , North Shensi , 30 AugA HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY reporter commented :
After Wedemeyer &apos;s announcement , the little court of the House of Chiang has been putting on all kinds of performances on successive days , indicating that America and Chiang are singing a duet like the act performed by Lu Ch &apos;i @-@ ch &apos;I and Chang Hsi @-@ hsi , the clowns of Shanghai &apos;s Ta @-@ shih @-@ chieh amusement park .
Knowing well that &quot; corruption &quot; and &quot; Inefficiency &quot; are fundamentally inseparable from the Chiang group , American imperialism wants this Chiang Kal @-@ shek , who is covered with sores head to foot , to &quot; reform . &quot; It is like leading a camel through the neddle &apos;s eye .
Then why does Uncle Sam insist that his child perform something absolutely impossible ?
There are two goals : On the one hand it will create excuses for the American imperialist authorities , so that , after whitewashing the toliet cover of the Chiang Kai @-@ shek group , they can openly dump arms and loans into Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s bottomless pit .
On the other hand Wedemeyer &apos;s fancy words , such as &quot; strictness , &quot; &quot; fairness , &quot; and &quot; the Chinese people &apos;s yearning for peace , &quot; are for the purpose of calming the anger of the Chinese and American people toward American imperialism and Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s rotten regime .
The CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR of the 27th leaked the hidden plans : &quot; Wedemeyer announced that the door to aid Chiang and resist communism had not been closed . &quot; Meanwhile , the NEW YORK TIMES openly stated : &quot; Many able &apos; authorities1 and officials under &apos; Chairman1 Chiang are &apos; absolutely &apos; capable of reform . &quot; The truth is revealed .
Chiang Kai @-@ shek and the four big families are good and &quot; authoritative , &quot; and the bad ones are only the generally &quot; inefficient &quot; low @-@ level staff and the &quot; local government structure &quot; personnel who need some &quot; reform . &quot;
After the procuress had sung for a while , the prostitutes ascended the stage , led by Sun K &apos;o and Wu T &apos;ieh @-@ ch &apos;eng , vigorously acting out the modern drama of prostitution .
The titles of the programs were &quot; Purging Corruption &quot; and &quot; Strict Enforcement of Regulations on Punishing Corruption . &quot; Here there
were several implied &quot; benefits &quot; : The various groups could make use of the opportunity to vent their anger against the thorns in their flesh .
Meanwhile , &quot; purging corruption &quot; was &quot; very successful . &quot; Hereafter we will see many farces , such as the Huang @-@ p &apos;u faction prosecuting the CC faction or the political study faction hauling out the K &apos;ung @-@ Soon clique .
Afterward , the procuress returned unsatisfied and sang again .
Following her we will probably see the performers exchanging their roles , the so @-@ called &quot; reorganization . &quot; According to a U.S.
UNITED PRESS report on the 27th , &quot; Wedemeyer &apos;s criticisms will be thoroughly digested by the members of the Kuomintang Central Committee .
They will hold a meeting in the near future to partly reorganize the &apos; coalition government1 controlled by the Kuomintang . &quot; Sun K &apos;o became more active .
He gave an interview to a CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY reporter in Canton : &quot; Sun has cleared up all the misunderstandings of outsiders concerning Wedemeyer &apos;s announcement .
All American suspicions about aiding China ( Chiang ) will be completely allayed .
He stresses that the major task of the &apos; special envoyT is to determine how America should render aid to China . &quot; Thus , Wu TTieh @-@ chfeng was moved to tears by his gratitude : &quot; General Wedemeyer &apos;s words were frank and sincere . &quot; Thus , what Wedemeyer directed was merely a duet .
Nevertheless , the highlight of the duet was still Sun Kfo .
Though the main goal of Wedemeyer &apos;s vociferous advocation of &quot; peace &quot; is to play for time and give Chiang Kai @-@ shek an opportunity to reorganize and equip his troops and reinforce the offensive , Wedemeyer knows that this is extremely difficult to accomplish .
Therefore , he resigns himself to the second best :
Aid to Chiang and the civil war are inseparably linked and so are the civil war and the amount of aid .
However , there must be an excuse in order to convince the financial bosses in America who balk at the bottomless pit .
To preserve the status of Uncle Sam , there has to be some lecturing .
But if the wording is too severe , it may produce the side effects of &quot; contemptible defeatism &quot; and internal demoralization among the children .
Therefore , a brilliant performance is required in order to convince the bosses above and energize the rank and file below .
Thus , it is necessary to speak in a different tone , slightly different from the CC and Huang @-@ p &apos;u factions .
As the highlight of the program in the modern zoo is the joint performance of the foreigners and the animals , Sun K &apos;o , after playing the prostitute , emerged as a monkey .
Backstage , Wedemeyer sang : &quot; Let them make peace ! &quot; Sun K &apos;o , turning somersaults on stage : &quot; Fight !
Fight !
The Communist Party must be wiped out by force ! &quot; The &quot; fight to the finish &quot; sung by the openly fascist chief Chiang Kai @-@ shek will be somewhat different from the &quot; fight to the end &quot; sung by Sun K &apos;o , who prostitutes as a &quot; liberalist . &quot; We can expect the third appearance of the procuress on stage , followed by a display of coppers and firearms .
The reporter pointed out in conclusion : The bankruptcy of Wedemeyer &apos;s reputation and the bankruptcy of the court of the House of Chiang in all aspects constitute the final declaration of bankruptcy of the prostitutes and monkeys such as Sun K &apos;o .
The people are pushing them from total
bankruptcy to a permanent grave .

CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY SPOKESMAN SOLEMNLY EXPOSES U.S.
AND CHIANG COLLUSION TO MURDER AND PERSECUTE DEMOCRATIC FIGURES
12 October 1947
&#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY , , North Shensi , 12 OctA Chinese Communist spokesman today points out to the reporter that the murder of Mr Tu Pin @-@ ch &apos;engj a famous educator in the Northwest , indicates that Chiang Kai @-@ shekTs bandit gang wants to maintain its shaky control by expanding the slaughter of democratic figures .
The spokesman states :
In murdering democratic figures , Chiang Kai @-@ shek shamelessly claims that they are Communist Party members .
When his bandits shot and killed Mr Tu Pin @-@ chTeng in Sian , they declared that he was a responsible person of the Communist Party committee of Kuanchung District .
Actually , he was a responsible person of the Democratic League in the Northwest .
He waged a lifelong struggle for the democratic cause and won the admiration of the people of the Northwest .
He was not a Communist Party member .
The spokesman says : To suppress the workers &apos; strikes and to arrest and slaughter the strikers in Shanghai , Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s bandits forged the so @-@ called Chinese Communist documents and claimed that the Chinese Communist Party wanted to destroy the Shanghai power plant .
To persecute the Democratic League , the bandits spread rumors that it had accepted underground work for the Communist Party .
In Peiping they arrested many disaffected persons , including a number of high @-@ level officials .
In the past and at present , a number of officials of the American Government and its secret service organ have been serving as spies for Chiang Kai @-@ shek , identifying to his bandits the democratic and disaffected figures for arrest and slaughter .
Many of those persecuted have clearly expressed their views to such bloody butchers as Wedemeyer and certain American officials showing a false sympathy for China &apos;s democratic movement .
The spokesman says that the Chiang Kai @-@ shek bandit gang is currently launching a large @-@ scale cruel persecution of the democratic movement in areas under Chiang &apos;s control , indicating a loss of confidence in its control .
As the People &apos;s Liberation Array has taken the offensive on all fronts , including the Shantung battlefield , the bandits are alarmed ; therefore , they hastily seek excuses to commit murders in order to frighten the people into
submission .
Nevertheless , killing will only expand the anti @-@ Chiang movement .
The more insanely the dictator kills people , the closer he approaches perdition .
This truth has been proved thousands of times in the histories of China and foreign countries .

CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE SPOKESMAN SEVERELY CONDEMNS CHIANG @-@ U.S.
DIRTY DEALS
2 December 1947
&#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY , North .
Shensi , 2 DecA Chinese Communist Party Central Committee spokesman states :
The Chiang Kai @-@ shek bandit gang and American , imperialism recently again agreed on a dirty deal .
Chiang consented to American imperialism &apos;s demand that China &apos;s customs be turned over as collateral for loans .
Ever since bloody butcher Wedemeyer &apos;s observation trip to China , American imperialism has , through the Chiang Kai @-@ shek bandit gang , seized many items of China &apos;s national sovereignty .
During Wedemeyer &apos;s stay in China , the items sold by the Chiang Kai @-@ shek bandit gang included 8 military bases , 1 naval base ,
3 air bases , 3 base networks , and the right to invest $ 350 million in Kwangtung and Kwangsi .
On 6 September Owen D.
Young , an American , was appointed advisor to the Stabilization Fund Committee .
He and the group of Americans he brought with him exercise supervisory power over the finances of the Chiang government .
On 17 October the Foreign Ministry of the Chiang government granted official permission to America to station its troops in China , thus formally giving American imperialism the right to station troops .
By the so @-@ called Sino @-@ Atnerican relief agreement signed on 27 October , Chiang &apos;s government gave American Imperialism supervisory power over relief resources and similar resources produced in China or Imported from abroad .
By the so @-@ called educational fund agreement signed on 10 November , the Chiang government gave American imperialism supervisory power over culture and education .
In addition , American imperialism has obtained ever @-@ increasing privileges in the training of Chiang &apos;s army and is attempting to organize a joint staff under American control , similar to the one in Greece , in order to gain command over Chiang &apos;s army .
Now the Chiang bandit gang has sold China &apos;s sovereignty over Its customs .
After selling so many items of national sovereignty since last July , what bandit Chiang has received in U.S.
loans has been only $ 27.7 million of so @-@ called &quot; grain relief . &quot; What he has not yet received , but may possibly receive , involves merely $ 67 million In a U.S.
cotton loan signed on 12 September last year , $ 300 million announced by Marshall on 11 November , and $ 60
million in &quot; temporary aid &quot; proposed by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the U.S.
House of Representatives .
Since the People &apos;s Liberation Army launched a counteroffensive , American reactionaries have realized that the Chiang Kai @-@ shek bandit gang , in resisting the struggle of the Chinese people , is a &quot; mangy dog which cannot be propped up &quot; and that no aid can avert its perdition .
The American imperialists intensely hate the Chinese people .
Nevertheless , since the Chinese people have proved that they cannot be vanquished , the China policy of American imperialism is to give the mangy dog enough &quot; aid &quot; to keep it from starvation , but not enough to satisfy it , in order to prolong its life , China &apos;s civil war , and the people &apos;s misery .
Yet American imperialism will never slacken its aggression against China &apos;s sacred sovereignty .
When the situation of the Chiang Kai @-@ shek bandit gang becomes more critical , the greedy yet miserly money imperialism will propose ever more harsh conditions and make the Chiang Kai @-@ shek bandit gang sell more of the national sovereignty for less money .
Whenever they feel like it , anyone among the American imperialistsTom , Dick , or Harrywill give mangy dog Chiang Kai @-@ shek a lecture .
Afraid to make a sound , bandit Chiang has to bow in acquiescence .
The Chinese Communist Party Central Committee spokesman states :
To recover China &apos;s sacred and inviolable sovereignty , all patriotic countrymen must carry out the contents of the People &apos;s Liberation Army declaration of the Double Ten Festival this year and accelerate the overthrow of the Chiang Kai @-@ shek bandit gang .
The day of final reckoning for the usurper of the nation is not far off .
The Chiang Kai @-@ shek bandit gang and American imperialism must take full responsibility for all the grave consequences of their criminal deals .

&apos;HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY &apos;REPORTER COMMENTS ON GREAT PLA VICTORY ON SOUTHERN FRONT
24 December 1947
. &#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY , North .
Shensi , 23 DecCommenting on the recent great victories in the Central Plain , a reporter of this news agency points out :
The complete destruction of the southern section of the Peiping @-@ Hankow railway and the eastern section of the Lung @-@ Hai railway has smashed Chiang &apos;s operations in the Central Plain , the major battlefield of his civil war , while Honan @-@ Hupeh @-@ Anhwei , Kiangsu @-@ Shantung @-@ Honan @-@ Anhwei , and Honan @-@ Shensi @-@ Hupeh , the three large newly liberated areas , have merged into one vast area .
This situation has created extremely favorable conditions for the PLA to wipe out the enemy in large numbers hereafter , forecasting more and greater victories in 1948 .
In the past month or more our counterattacking army , inarching south in three sectors , devoted its entire force to mopping up the bandit and puppet troops In the new areas and helped the local people emancipate themselves ; therefore , the war situation was quite for a time .
Bandit Chiang was alarmed and frightened .
As the destruction of the section east of KTai @-@ feng on the Lung @-@ Hai line was already a heavy blow , he wishfully attempted to muster large numbers of troops to defend the southern section of the Peiping @-@ Hankow line , the only remaining railway in the Central Plain .
Nevertheless , with the power of thunder and the speed of lightning , the three sectors of our great army separately launched gigantic offensives on the 13th and 14th .
In just 3 days the southern section of the Peiping @-@ Hankow line between Cheng @-@ chou and Hsin @-@ yang and the eastern section of the Lung @-@ Hai line between K &apos;ai @-@ feng and Cheng @-@ chou , a total of 840 li of railway line , were destroyed ; Hsu @-@ ch &apos;ang , Lan @-@ feng , Min @-@ ch &apos;uan , Hsin @-@ chung @-@ mou , Ch &apos;en @-@ liu , Wei @-@ shih , Wel @-@ chou , Ch &apos;ang @-@ ko , Yen @-@ ling , Fu @-@ kou , Hsin @-@ cheng , Hsi @-@ hsien , Shang @-@ ts &apos;ai , Ch &apos;ueh @-@ shan , Hsi @-@ p &apos;ing , Sui @-@ p &apos;ing , Lin @-@ ying , TTung @-@ po , Pi @-@ yang , Wu @-@ yang , Yeh @-@ hsien , Hsiang @-@ chTeng , and Tsao @-@ yang , a total of 23 cities , were captured ; over 20,000 of Chiang &apos;s bandit troops were wiped out .
T &apos;a @-@ ho and Chu @-@ ma @-@ tien , strategic towns in the Central Plain in the civil wars of the past , were also liberated by our army .
the reporter points out :
This great battle is still in the process of escalating .
The destruction of the southern section , of the Peiping @-@ Hankow line and the eastern section of the Lung @-@ Hai line has not only smashed bandit Chiang &apos;s operations in the Central Plain but also nullified his railway mobility .
Meanwhile , the development of the war will further reveal his inability to cover all fronts due to the shortage of troops , thereby creating favorable conditions for our mobile , flexible , and seasoned field army &quot; to wipe out the enemy on a large scale .
Currently , Cheng @-@ chou , the site of the command post of bandit Chiang &apos;s army general headquarters , and such key points as K &apos;ai @-@ feng , Lo @-@ yang , and Shang @-@ chTiu have become isolated .
Hsin @-@ yang , another important military key point of bandit Chiang , is exposed and in imminent danger .
The vast Central Plain is almost entirely under our control .
Hereafter , the PLA may proceed wherever it pleases , either east to the Ching @-@ p &apos;u line , or west to Hsiang @-@ fan , or south across the Yangtze , making bandit Chiang , who follows the &quot; hollow @-@ center perimeter defense tactics , &quot; unable to collect himself .
Here the reporter comments optimistically :
The tens of millions of people in the Central Plain rising in self @-@ defense and their close cooperation with the PLA have vastly reinforced our great counteroffensive army .
Meanwhile , the close coordination of the three sectors of our great army will deal the proper punishment to the isolated Chiang troops .
The great victory on the southern section of the Peiping @-@ Hankow line was merely the beginning of a series of greater victories hereafter .

FOREWORD TO &apos; HOW SHANSI &apos;S KUO COUNTY CARRIES OUT LAND REFORM &apos; 12 March 1948
&#91; Text &#93; This is a communication from Shansi &apos;s Kuo County .
It indicates that the mass struggle there has been launched , that the masses have been aroused , and that all preparations for land division were being completed at a meeting of peasant delegates .
In the process of class classification , many people were erroneously classified , but it was decided , through open and clear discussions at a delegates meeting , that the mistakes will be corrected .
Such errors as failing to provide the landowners with the necessary way to make a living , failing to distinguish between the landlords and the rich peasants , and encroaching upon the interests of the middle peasants were criticized .
In sum , the line demonstrated at the two district peasant delegates meetings described in the communication is completely correct .
At the time the communication was written , Kuo County had not yet divided the land ; therefore , the experience in this aspect is incomplete .
We hope that the area , after completing the tasks of correcting the mistakes in class classification ( a major matter ) , dividing the land , organizing production , and reforming the political power , will send another communication describing the entire process .
As for how to perform the work of party rectification , we have the typical experience of P &apos;ing @-@ shan County of the Shansi @-@ Chahar @-@ Hopeh Border Region ( summarized by Comrade Liu Shao @-@ ch &apos;i ) .
As for how to perform the work of readjusting the land , not dividing the land ( because it had already been divided ) , we have the typical experience of Huang @-@ chia @-@ chTuan , Sui @-@ te County , Shensi @-@ Kansu @-@ Ninghsia Border Region .
Now we also have the land division experience ( Though incomplete ) of Kuo county in the Shansi @-@ Suiyuan region .
It will be worthwhile to compile these three experiences into a pamphlet for distribution to each and every rural work cadre .
Such a pamphlet describing typical experiences will be more vivid and fruitful than the resolutions and directives of our leadership organs .
It will furnish the inexperienced comrades with the means to start work and to effectively smash the serious anti @-@ Marxist commandism and tailism existing In the party .
After issuing resolutions or directives on all Items of Important work under their jurisdiction , the leadership comrades of all central bureaus , central branch bureaus , and frontline committees must collect and spread selected
typical experiences and make the mass movements under their guidance develop along the correct line .
Currently , when hundreds of millions of people are launching an attack on the reactionary feudal and compradore system according to the direction pointed out by the party , the responsibility of the leader is not only to point out the direction of struggle and determine the struggle tasks , but also to summarize the concrete experiences and promptly spread them among the people , so that the correct matters will be popularized and the mistakes will not be repeated .

DECISION ON TWO DOCUMENTS OF 1933
Adopted by the CCP Central Committee on 25 May 1948
&#91; Text &#93; Two documents of 1933 , &quot; How To Differentiate the Classes &quot; and &quot; Decision on Some Problems Concerning Land Struggle , &quot; were issued by the democratic central government in that year to correct certain standpoints in land reform work and to correctly resolve the land problem .
These two documents were distributed to various levels of party committees in the Liberated Areas in December 1947 as reference documents .
Now we have decided to use these two documents as formal documents and have redistributed them to various levels of party committees .
Only a small part of these two documents is now inapplicable and has been deleted , while the rest is basically applicable in the present land reform work .
In some places minor revisions have been made or &quot; CCP Central Committee Note &quot; has been added .
Regarding problems not mentioned in these two documents and the dividing line between rich peasants and middle peasants , other documents issued by the Central Committee should be consulted , and the text of Comrade Jen Pi @-@ shin &apos;s &#91; 0117 1732 2514 &#93; speech , &quot; Several Problems in Land Reform , &quot; delivered on 12 January 1948 , should be used as the standard .
How to Differentiate the Classes ( 1 ) Landlords
Those who occupy land , do not work themselves or only do some incidental work , and depend on exploitation for their living are called landlords .
At the same time they may also lend money , hire workers , or engage in industrial or commercial enterprises .
However , to exploit rental from peasants is the main form of exploitation of the landlords .
Management of land and property of shrines and temples and the collection of tuition also fall within the category of rental exploitation .
Some landlords are already bankrupt , but they still do not work , relying on cheating , plundering , or assistance from relatives or friends for their living .
Their living conditions are better than those of the average middle peasant .
These people are still regarded as landlords .
Warlords , bureaucrats , local tyrants , and evil gentry are also the most ruthless members of that class Cthere are also some small local tyrants and evil gentry among the rich peasants ) .
Those who help landlords collect rent and manage property , who rely on the exploitation of peasants as their main source of living , and whose living conditions are better than those of middle peasants should be treated the same as landlords .
Those who rely on lending money at high interest rates as their main source of living and whose living conditions are better than those of ordinary middle peasants are called usurpers and should be regarded as landlords .
( 2 ) Rich Peasants
Rich peasants generally occupy land .
Some rich peasants occupy the land they own and rent more land from others ; other rich peasants do not have any land of their own at all , and their land is entirely rented ( cases of this are rare ) .
Generally , rich peasants have better means of production and liquid capital .
They are engaged in labor , but they always rely upon exploitation as a part , or a major part , of their source of living .
Their main form of exploitation is exploitation of the labor of hired help ( long @-@ term help ) .
They may also rent a part of their land , for rental , or lend money , or engage in industrial or commercial enterprises .
Most rich peasants manage communal property .
Rich peasants in China usually do the farming themselves without hiring help .
They regularly exploit peasants through rentals and interest on loans , and in most cases it represents their &#91; main source of income &#93; .
( 3 ) Middle Peasants
Many middle peasants own land .
Some middle peasants own part of their land and rent the rest .
Other middle peasants own no land of their own and rent all their land .
( These cases are few . ) All middle peasants have a fair amount of tools .
They rely solely or mostly on their own labor as the source of their living .
Middle peasants generally do not exploit others .
Many of them are exploited in the form of small payments in land rents and interest on loans .
However , middle peasants generally do not sell their labor .
Some middle peasants ( well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants ) exploit others to a slight extent , but such exploitation is only occasional and not their main source of income .
These are middle peasants .
( .4 ) Poor Peasants
Some poor peasants do own land and have a few tools .
Other poor peasants do not have any land at all and only a few tools .
Generally , the land they work is rented , and they are exploited by paying rent and interest .
A small number of them are exploited as they work as hired helpers .
All these are poor peasants .
2T2
Middle peasants generally do not have to sell their labor , but poor peasants generally do .
This is the main criterion differentiating a middle and a poor peasant ,
( 5 ) Workers
Workers ( including hired peasants ) generally own no land or tools .
Some workers have very little land and very few tools .
They make their living entirely or mainly by selling their labor .
These are workers .
Decisions Concerning Some Problems in the Land Struggle
During the struggle for land distribution and land investigation there were many problems .
These problems caused mistakes in the execution of the struggle due to the lack of regulations in existing documents , or ambiguity in the regulations , or incorrect interpretation of the regulations by government workers .
To correctly develop the land struggle and correct and prevent mistakes regarding these problems , the People &apos;s Committee , aside from approving &quot; How To Differentiate the Classes &quot; ( concerning the principles in differentiating landlords , rich peasants , middle peasants and workers ) , makes the following decisions :
( 1 ) Labor and Incidental Labor
Under ordinary conditions a family is considered to be engaged in labor if there is one member of the family who devotes one @-@ third of his time in a year to essential labor .
A family is considered to be engaged in incidental labor if there is one member of the family who devotes less than one @-@ third of his time in a year to essential labor , or one @-@ third of his time on a year to nonessential labor .
( Explanation ) The following should be noted : ( 1 ) Rich peasants are engaged in labor , while landlords are not , or are only engaged in incidental labor .
Therefore , labor is the main criterion to distinguish a rich peasant and a landlord .
( 2 ) The number of persons used in determining whether a family is a laboring family is one .
If a family has several members , and one of them is engaged in labor , then the family is regarded as engaged in labor .
Some people think that a family cannot be considered a laboring family unless there are two persons engaged in labor , or all members of the family engage in labor .
This is wrong ,
( .3 ) The standard length of time used to determine the type of labor is one--third of a year , or 4 months .
That is to say , if one is engaged in essential labor more than 4 months out of the year , one is considered to be engaged In labor ; if one is engaged in essential labor less than 4 months a year , one is considered to be engaged in incidental labor ( also the dividing line between rich peasants and landlords ) .
Some people have classified those who devoted 6 months a year to essential labor as being engaged in incidental labor .
This is wrong .
2T3
( 4 ) So @-@ called essential labor indicates labor in essential parts of production , such as plowing , cultivating , harvesting and other important labor in production , and is not limited to agricultural production .
Cutting firewood , carrying loads , transportation , weaving , medical service , teaching and other labor are also important .
( 5 ) So @-@ called nonessential labor means various types of incidental labor which are secondary in importance during the process of production , such as weeding , vegetable planting and tending livestock .
( 6 ) Since labor is used as the main criterion for determining who is a rich peasant and who is a landlord , those who hire long @-@ term helpers for farm work only without collecting rent or interest , and who direct production without participating in essential labor themselves , are to be treated as landlords .
( 7 ) A period of 3 years is used as a standard criterion to determine who has the elements of a landlord .
One is considered to have elements of a landlord if he had lived continuously for 3 years as a landlord immediately prior to the establishment of the revolutionary regime .
Many mistakes were made during the land distribution and land investigation movement regarding the problem of labor and incidental labor .
Sometimes the labor of a peasant is regarded as incidental labor , and the peasant is subsequently judged to be a landlord .
At other times the incidental labor of a landlord is regarded as labor , and the landlord is subsequently judged to &quot; be a rich peasant .
All these -mistakes were caused by the lack of clear standards to make a distinction between landlords and rich peasants .
These mistakes can be avoided by using the above regulations .
However , the above regulations are applicable under &quot; ordinary conditions . &quot; Under special conditions different dispositions should be made .
Here there are two conditions : First , there are members of the family of big landlords who engage in labor .
For example , some families collect more than 100 tan of grain as rent or dispense more than 1,000 yuan in loans .
The size of the family is small and their expenditures are low .
Although there are members of the family engaged in essential labor for more than 4 months a year , this kind of family is still regarded as a family of landlords , not rich peasants .
However , if the family is big and its expenditures are high , although this family collects more than 100 tan of grain as rent and lends 1,000 yuan , this family is not to be regarded as a landlord &apos;s family but as a rich peasant &apos;s family as long as there is someone in the family engaged in essential labor .
Second , some people are landlords if exploitation is used as a criterion , but they cannot be treated as landlords if their living conditions are used as a criterion .
For example , some people were formerly rich or middle peasants , but a few years before the revolution they , were forced to rent the land out or to hire helpers to work on the farm due to a sudden loss of labor force in the family , such as deaths or sickness .
As a result , the whole family lives like landlords .
If we treat these people as landlords , it is inappropriate .
Instead , they
should be treated accqrding to ther present conditions .
For another example , some people are landlords in name only , and their land ownership has been passed to others .
Their income from exploitation is very small , and their living conditions are worse than those of ordinary peasants , They are engaged in incidental labor .
These people -may &quot; be treated as peasants .
The above situations were overlooked during the land distribution and land
investigation movement .
This was wrong , ,
( In a large family of more than 15 persons , the family cannot be considered as engaged in labor unless one @-@ third of the members of the family spend one @-@ third of their time during the year in essential labor ^ -CCP Central Committee Note . )
( 2 ) Well @-@ to @-@ do Middle Peasants
Well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants are a part of the middle peasants , but their living conditions are better than those of ordinary middle peasants .
They generally exploit others to a small extent , but their income from exploitation does not exceed 15 percent of the family &apos;s total annual income .
Under certain conditions the family &apos;s income from exploitation exceeds 15 percent but does not exceed 30 percent of the family &apos;s total annual income .
These peasants should still be regarded as well @-@ to @-@ do peasants if there is no objection from the masses .
Under the democratic regime , the interests of well * -do @-@ to middle peasants should be protected in the same way as those of middle peasants ,
( Explanation ) It should be noted here : ( 1 ) Wellr @-@ to ^ -do -middle peasants are a part of the middle peasants .
The difference between the well @-@ to ^ do middle peasant and the middle peasant is that the former is better off than the latter .
Well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants generally exploit others slightly , while other middle peasants generally do not exploit others at all .
( 2 ) The difference between the well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasant and the rich peasant is that a well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasant &apos;s income from exploitation does not exceed 15 percent of the total annual income of the family &gt; while a rich peasant &apos;s income from exploitation exceeds 15 percent .
The establishment of this limit is necessary to determine the class elements of peasants .
( 3 ) The so @-@ called slight exploitation by well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants indicates that they hire shepherds , tempoerary helpers , or monthly helpers ; or they lend a small amount of money ; or they collect a small amount of mortgage interest , a small amount of interest on tuition loans , or a small amount on land rent .
The total income from these exploitations does not constitute a significant part of the entire family &apos;s total annual income .
The main source of income of the entire family depends upon their own labor .
( 4 ) Just prior to the establishment of the revolutionary government , some of the well @-@ to &gt; -do middle peasants had received income from exploitation comparable to that of rich peasants .
However , if such exploitation did not occur for more than 2 years , they are still regarded as well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants ,
( 5 ) Under certain conditions , if their income from exploitation exceeded 15 percent but was less than 30 percent of the family &apos;s total annual income , they may still be regarded as well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants if there is no objection from the masses .
The so @-@ called &quot; certain conditions &quot; indicate that although their income from exploitation exceeded 15 percent , the size of the family is large , its labor force is small , its living conditions are poor , and it encounters difficulties due to flood , drought , famine , sickness or death in the family .
Under these conditions , if their income from exploitation does not exceed 30 percent of the family &apos;s total annual income , they should not be regarded as rich peasants and ought to be regarded as middle peasants .
In the absence of these conditions , if their income from exploitation exceeds 15 percent of their total annual income , they are regarded as rich peasants , not as well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants .
A correct judgment of these conditions depends upon the consensus of the local masses .
Well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants constitute a considerably large part of the population in villages .
During the land distribution and land investigation movement , many well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants were regarded as rich peasants .
This was wrong .
In many places where the middle peasant was wronged , the offenses were mostly against this kind of well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasant .
This should be corrected immediately .
( Example ) ( 1 ) Two members of a family of six are engaged in labor .
The family owns a piece of 50 * -tan farmland ( actually harvesting 35 tan of grain a year ) .
At the market price of 4 yuan a tan , the value of the annual harvest is 140 yuan .
Farming is done entirely by family members .
The family also owns a five @-@ room house and an ox .
It has a pond which yields 12 yuan worth of fish .
Other food crop production and hog raising bring the family approximately 100 yuan a year .
For 4 years the family lent 3 tan of grain each year at an annual interest rate of 50 percent and collected 1 1 / 2 tan of grain a year valued at 6 yuan .
For 5 years the family lent 100 yuan each year at an annual interest rate of 25 percent , which brings an annual income of 25 yuan .
Judgment : This family relies on its own labor for its main source of living .
The income from its own production is 250 yuan a year , while the income from exploitation is only 31 yuan , which is less than 15 percent of the family &apos;s total annual income .
The family has some savings after expenditures .
Its living conditions are fairly good .
Since its income from exploitation is not high , this family is therefore regarded as a family of well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants , not rich peasants .
C2 ) In a family of five , one and one ^ half persons are engaged in labor .
The family has a 25 @-@ tan farmland with an actual harvest of 17 tan of grain
per year .
The family rents from others a 75 @-@ tan piece of farmland which
has an actual yield of 42 tan of grain a year , and it pays rent of 25 tan of grain per year .
The family has been paying rent for 10 years .
Various food crops and hog raising &quot; bring the family 50 yuan a year .
The family hires a shepherd and collects 18 yuan a year as interest on a loan of 60 yuan .
The interest rate was 30 percent per annum .
The family has been lending money for 4 years .
It has a five @-@ room house and an ox .
It also owns an orchard yielding 30 tan of peaches &apos; a year .
Judgment : This family lives on its own labor .
The income from exploitation is very small , about 20 yuan ( including the value of surplus labor resulting from the hiring of a shepherd and interest on loans ) , but the family is exploited by others because it pays as much as 25 tan of grain a year .
There is little money left after expenditures .
Therefore , this family can only be classified as a family of middle peasants , not even as well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants .
( The distinction between well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants and rich peasants stated in this article , according to Comrade .Jen Pi @-@ shih1 s &quot; Several Problems in Land Reform , &quot; should be changed to read : &quot; Those who slightly exploit others and whose income from exploitation does not exceed 25 percent of their total income are still regarded as middle peasants or well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants . &quot; CCP Central Committee Note )
( 3 ) Duration of Exploitation and Income From Exploitation of Rich Peasants
For 3 consecutive years prior to the establishment of the new political regime , those who , aside from participating in labor , depended upon exploitation as a part of a large part of the source of their living and whose income from such exploitation exceeded 15 percent of their total annual income are called rich peasants .
Under certain conditions , although their income from exploitation exceeded 15 percent but did not exceed 30 percent , they are still not rich peasants but well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants if there is no objection from the masses .
( Explanation ) It should be noted : ( 1 ) The date of establishment of the revolutionary regime should be used as the starting point to count back the number of years of exploitation .
Some people used exploitation that occurred many years ago , or exploitation that did not occur in consecutive years , as the basis for determining the class element of a peasant .
This is wrong .
( 2 ) Three consecutive years of exploitation should be used as the standard that determines a peasant to be a rich peasant .
If the duration of exploitation is 3 years but not 3 consecutive years , the peasant is still regarded as a well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasant although his income from exploitation is equal to that of a rich peasant during the same period of time .
( 3 ) A famlyTs Income from exploitation must exceed 15 percent of its total annual income before it can be classified as a family of rich peasants .
If its income from exploitation is less than 15 percent of its total annual income , the family is still regarded as a family of well @-@ to @-@ do peasants even though the duration of exploitation is 3 consecutive years or more than 3 consecutive years ,
( 4 ) The so @-@ called total income of a family indicates the total income from production and the income from exploitation .
For example , a family &apos;s income from production is 400 yuan , and its income from exploitation is 100 yuan .
The total income of the family is 500 yuan .
Since the portion of income from exploitation is 20 percent of the total income , this family is regarded as a family of rich peasants .
( 5 ) &quot; Certain conditions &quot; indicate that the size of the family is large and its labor force is small .
The living conditions of the family are poor .
Due to natural disaster and other family disasters , the family encounters difficulties .
Under these conditions , although the income from exploitation exceeds 15 percent of the family &apos;s total income Cbut does not exceed 30 percent ) , this family is regarded as a well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasant family , if there is no objection from the masses .
Here the opinion of the masses is very important .
We must give careful consideration to this situation .
If we wrongly classify well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants as rich peasants , we will arouse the dissatisfaction of the middle peasant masses .
At the same time , we should not classify rich peasants as well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants , because we may arouse the dissatisfaction of the poor peasants .
Therefore , we must think carefully and seek the consent of the masses .
During the land distribution and land investigation movement , many disputes arose concerning the problem of duration and percentage of exploitation .
This was due to the lack of a clear standard to make a distinction &quot; between rich peasants and well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants .
Sometimes well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants were treated as rich peasants .
At other times rich peasants were treated as well @-@ to ^ -do middle peasants .
Mistakes occurred frequently .
Now that the distinction between the two is defined , mistakes can be avoided ,
( Example ) ( 1 ) A family has 11 members , and only 2 are engaged in labor .
The family has a 160 @-@ tan farm which yields 120 tan of grain valued at 480 yuan , It has two tea plots which bring an annual income of 30 yuan .
It also has a pond which brings n 15 yuan a year .
Other food crops and hog raising bring approximately 150 yuan a year .
The family hired a long @-@ term helper for 7 years until the revolution ..
The surplus labor exploited from this helper is estimated at approximately 60 yuan a year .
The family lent 250 yuan at an annual interest rate of 30 percent , receiving 75 yuan annually .
The family lent money for 5 years until the revolution .
Judgment : This family is engaged in labor , but it also hires a long @-@ term helper .
Its income from exploitation exceeds 15 percent of its total annual income .
Although the family Is large , it has a relatively large amount of money left over after expenditures .
Therefore , this family is a family of rich peasants ,
( 2 ) In a family of three , one person is engaged in essential labor for 4 months out of the year .
It has a 60 @-@ r--tan farm .
The family used half the land and harvested 18 tan of grain a year .
The other half was rented .
The family collected 12 tan of grain a year as rent for 5 years .
It usually hired short @-@ term helpers 20 days a year .
The family has an ox and collected 2 tan of grain a year for lending the ox .
It lent 120 yuan at an interest
rate of 30 percent per annum .
The income from the loan was 36 yuan a year .
The family had lent money for 5 years before the revolution .
Judgment : This family &apos;s income from exploitation exceeds its income from its own production .
Since there is one person engaged in essential labor 4 months out of the year , this family is considered to be a family of rich peasants .
( The line of distinction between rich peasants and well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants should be based on what was announced In Comrade Jen Pi @-@ shih &apos;s &quot; Several Problemsn in Land Reform . &quot; It should be changed to read : &quot; Those who exploit slightly and whose income from exploitation does not exceed 25 percent of their total income are considered to be middle peasants or well @-@ to @-@ do middle peasants . &quot; CCP Central Committee Note )
( 4 ) Reactionary Rich Peasants
Those rich peasants who were engaged in serious counterrevolutionary activities before the revolution , and especially after the revolution , are called reactionary rich peasants .
Their land and property , and the land and property of the members of their family who participated in such counterrevolutionary activities , should be confiscated .
The above principle is applicable to reactionary capitalists .
( Explanation ) It should be noted here : ( 1 ) Only those rich peasants who were engaged in &quot; serious counterrevolutionary activities &quot; are called reactionary rich peasants .
For example , during the revolution they led civilian groups in slaughtering workers and peasants , put up stubborn resistance to the revolutionary government , led others in organizing counterrevolutionary organizations after the revolution , or conducted serious counterrevolutionary activities individually * such as assassination , spying for the enemy , voluntarily serving as guides for White troops , escaping to White areas to help the Kuomintang , and actively and resolutely sabotaging the land distribution and land investigation movement and economic construction .
The land and property of those rich peasants who did not provide leadership for or engage In important counterrevolutionary activities should not be confiscated , even though they engaged in some counterrevolutionary activities ,
C2 ) Only the land and property of those members of rich peasant families who participated in serious counterrevolutionary activities should be confiscated , while the land and property of other members of the family should not be confiscated .
( 3 ) Those who went to White areas for the purpose of making a living are not reactionary rich peasants and should not be treated as reactionary rich peasants .
( A ) The above regulations are applicable to defining and treating reactionary capitalists .
In the past , the land and property of rich peasants who did not engage in serious counterrevolutionary activities were confiscated , and the land and property of members of the family of rich peasants who did not participate in counterrevolutionary activities were also confiscated .
This is wrong .
The reason for this mistake can be traced to Article 3 of the &quot; Regulations for Land Confiscation and Distribution &quot; used in Kiangsi : &quot; All the land belonging to the family of rich peasants who participate in counterrevolutionary organizations should be confiscated . &quot; In this article , no distinction is made as to whether the rich peasant is a leader or a follower , or whether an Individual member of the family has joined such organizations or not .
The second half of this article pointed out : &quot; Land may &quot; be returned to family members who did not participate in counterrevolutionary organizations , did not engage in counterrevolutionary activities , and severed relations with family members who were counterrevolutionaries , if there is objection from the masses . &quot; However , the first half of the article provided for confiscation of all the land of the family , while the second half provided for partial return of the land confiscated .
This is not the proper way .
Therefore , this article should be amended according to the present regulation .
In the past , the definition of reactionary capitalists was broadened .
Some stores which should not have been confiscated were confiscated .
This is also wrong ,
( Example ) In a family of nine , one person is engaged in labor and another person is engaged in incidental labor .
The family owns a 160 ^ -tan farm .
It works a piece of 80 @-@ tan farmland which yields 56 tan of grain each year .
The other 80 @-@ tan area is rented , and the family collects an annual rent of 30 tan of grain a year for 10 years .
It also owns 5 plots of mountain land which yield an income of 70 yuan a year .
Normally the family hires a long @-@ term helper .
The family owes 425 yuan , paying interest at 25 percent per annum .
The family has been borrowing for 3 years .
The family has also been lending money for 3 years .
It lends 380 yuan , collecting 30 percent interest .
One of the family members has been a company leader in the Kuomintang militia &#91; Pacification Guards &#93; for 2 years .
He fought the Red Army in five battles .
Another member of the family has been a member of the AB Corps , but he is an insignificant member and was not active in it .
Other members of the family have no obvious reactionary activities .
Judgment : This family is a family of rich peasants .
One of the family members has engaged in serious counterrevolutionary work .
This particular person is a reactionary rich peasant , and his property should be confiscated , but the property of other family members should not be confiscated .
Although another member of the family joined the AB Corps , he was not active in it .
Therefore , his property should not be confiscated .
( This article applies to landlords and other criminals among the people . CCP Central Committee Kote ) .
( 5 ) Land , Houses , Cattle and Farm Implements Belong to Rich peasants
Under government law and regulations , land , houses , cattle and farm implements , once definitely ruled to be the property of rich peasants , should be freely available to the rich peasants without any interference by others .
( Explanation ) ( .1 ) Recently , in some places , workers , peasants and poor people exchanged their land , houses , cattle and farm implements for those belonging to rich peasants .
Some of them even exchanged their clothing and fertilizer .
This is wrong .
( 2 ) After the land problem has been correctly resolved , nobody should exchange their land for the share of land distributed to and subsequently improved by the rich peasants .
The cattle , farm implements and houses added by the rich peasants should not be confiscated or exchanged , even if such property is more than the rich peasants need .
( This article is also applicable to landlords.CCP Central Committee Note ) ( _ 6 ) Bankrupt Landlords
Before the revolution some landlords had already lost their means of exploitationland and propertyeither partially or entirely .
Those landlords who are still not engaged in production and depend upon cheating , seizure , or support from relatives as their main source of living and whose living conditions are better than those of ordinary middle peasants are called bankrupt landlords .
Bankrupt landlords belong to the landlord class .
Those landlords who , after bankruptcy , depend on their own labor as a partial source of livelihood , or depend on their labor for one @-@ third of their total living expenditure , may be treated as rich peasants .
( Explanation ) ( .1 ) Some people treated partially bankrupt landlords as bankrupt landlords .
This is wrong , because these landlords still possess part of their property for exploitation .
The only difference is that the amount of income from exploitation is changed .
C2 ) Some people regarded those landlords who , after bankruptcy , engaged in essential labor for a full year as bankrupt landlords .
This is even worse , because these landlords , after bankruptcy and after having engaged in essential labor for a full year ( prior to the revolution ) , have changed from landlords to workers , poor people or peasants .
C3 ) Some people still treated as landlords those who , after bankruptcy , a.re
partly engaged in labor .
This is wrong , because if their income from
labor has reached one @-@ third of their total annual living expenditures for
the entire family , they should be treated as rich peasants .
( 7 ) Poor People
Aside from workers and peasants , all those who rely wholly or largely on their own labor for a living , or rely on a small amount of capital for a business to earn their living , are called poor people if their living conditions are poor .
Unemployed village or small town poor people should be given some land .
( Explanation ) ( 1 ) Poor people constitute a great percentage of the population in cities .
There are also some poor people in villages and small towns .
The jobs of poor people are quite diversified .
Some of their jots are seasonal .
Poor people have hardships in their living .
Their income is insufficient to meet their expenditures .
( 2 ) Aside front workers and peasants , independent producers , professional workers , peddlers , store proprietors without employees , and all other laborers belong to the category of poor people if their living conditions are poor .
The so @-@ called independent producers are small , industrial producers who sell as well as produce their products .
They sometimes hire helpers , but they rely mainly on their own labor .
The so @-@ called professional workers are the medical doctors , teachers , lawyers , newspaper reporters , writers and artists .
They sometimes hire assistants or household helpers , but this kind of hiring is not regarded as exploitation ,
( 8 ) Intellectuals
Intellectuals should not be regarded as a class .
Their class is determined by ttieir family background .
Basically , a person &apos;s class is determined by the way he earns his essential income for living .
All intellectuals from landlord or bourgeois classes should be fully used to serve the democratic government if they obey the law of the democratic government .
At the same time , they should be educated to overcome the wrong thinking of the landlord , bourgeois and petit bourgeois classes .
When the intellectuals are working as @-@ teachers , editors , newspaper reporters , clerks , writers and artists without exploiting others , they are laborers using their brain .
These mental laborers should be protected by the law of the democratic government .
( .Explanation ) ( 1 ) Recently in &quot; some places , intellectuals have been discriminated against .
This Is wrong .
To absorb intellectuals from the landlord or bourgeois class who are willing to participate in the work of the democratic government is beneficial to the people &apos;s revolution .
While they work for the democratic government they should be helped to solve their livelihood problems .
( 2 ) The class of Intellectuals is determined by the class elements of their families .
For example , an intellectual has a landlord background if his
family is classified as a landlord family .
An intellectual has a middle peasant background if his family is regarded as a middle peasant family .
The class of the intellectual himself depends upon his main source of living .
For instance , if an intellectual earns his living as a landlord , he is a landlord .
If an intellectual earns his living as a capitalist , he is a capitalist .
If an intellectual earns his living as a free professional , he is a free professional .
If he earns his living as a clerk , he is a clerk .
If he earns his living as a soldier , he is a soldier .
If an intellectual depends on his family for his main source of living , then he belongs to the class tinder which his family is classified .
It is wrong to regard intellectuals as belonging to a single independent class .
To regard working people &apos;s children who have attended school ( so @-@ called &quot; graduates ) as bad elements s an even worse mistake .
( 3 ) Refusal to regard the work of teachers and doctors as labor is also wrong .
C9 ) Property @-@ less Loafers
Those workers , peasants- and other masses who lost their jobs and land as a result of oppression and exploitation By the landlord and capitalist class immediately before the establishment of the revolutionary government and subsequently relied upon improper ways as their main source of income for 3 years are called property @-@ less loafers ( customarily called vagrants ) .
The policy of the democratic government toward property @-@ less loafers is to woo them , but to oppose their dependence on the exploiting class and to oppose those who participate in counterrevolutionary activities .
The essential method of wooing them is to send them back to production by giving them land and work .
Those who are given land must live in the countryside and be able to work on the farmland themselves .
( Explanation ) ( 1 ) The so @-@ called &quot; improper wayst ?
as their main sources of income refer to theft , robbery , cheating , begging , gambling or prostitution .
It is wrong to classify all those who are employed or semiemployed and at the same time partly engaged in improper professions ( which do not constitute their main source of income ) as vagrants .
It is an even greater mistake to label as vagrants all those who at one time had engaged in prostitution or gambling or had the habit of opium smoking ,
( 2 ) In some places , those leaders of property @-@ less loafers who had actively participated in counterrevolutionary activities ( the so @-@ called chieftains of vagrants ) were not punished .
Instead , they were given land .
This is wrong .
In other places , all the requests of ordinary property @-@ less loafers for land were refused .
This is also wrong .
( 10 ) Religious Professionals
Those who had worked for 3 years prior to the revolution as ministers , priests , monks- , taoist preachers , horoscope readers or fortune tellers or
had engaged in other religious pr superstitious professions as their main source of income are called religious professionals .
( 11 ) Red Army Soldiers With Landlord and Rich Peasant Background and Their Land
Among the members of the Red Army , no matter whether they are commanders or soldiers , those with landlord and rich peasant backgrounds and their family members have the right to receive distributed land on the condition that they resolutely fight for the interests of the workers and peasants .
( Explanation ) .
( 1 ) Article 1 of the Regulations for Preferred Treatment of Members of the Red Army : &quot; Those soldiers of the Red Army and their family members who live in the territory of the democratic government should have the same right to share the land , houses , woods and ponds as local poor peasants , &quot; This applies to all Red Army soldiers .
However , recent inquiries were confined to the social background of the Red Army soldiers without regard to their political matlifestations .
The land distributed to Red Army soldiers with landlord and rich peasant background who resolutely fight for the interests of the workers and peasants were confiscated again .
This is wrong .
( 2 ) The so &apos; -called &quot; family members of Red Army soldiers &quot; refer to fathers , mothers , wives , sons , daughters and younger brothers and sisters under 16 years of age .
Persons other than their relatives are not entitled to the rights given to family members of Red Army soldiers .
( 12 ) Workers From Rich Peasant and Landlord Families
If a worker comes from a rich peasant or landlord family , the worker himself , his wife and children are still regarded as workers .
Other members of his family are regarded as rich peasants and landlords .
( Explanation ) ( 1 ) Those from landlord or rich peasant families who had sold their labor for a full year prior to the revolution are considered to be workers .
Their wives and children are also considered to be workers .
Other members of the family are regarded as rich peasants or landlords and are not entitled to any rights of the workers .
If there are members of the family with other class elements , they should be treated according to their class elements .
For example , in a family living in a village there is one person who depended on land rent and money @-@ lending AS his main source of living for 3 years ; this person is a landlord .
In the same family one person depended on selling his labor as his main source of living for a full year .
This person is a worker .
In the same family there is another person who lives in town and is engaged in a small industrial enterprise ( making and selling his own products ) as his main source of living , This person is an Independent producer .
Each of these persons of the same family s classified according to his source of living within a specified period of time and is treated accordingly under the laws pf the democratic government .
( 2 ) Among the village workers , independent producers , primary school teachers and doctors , those who own and rent small plots of land to others and do not depend on rent as their main source of living should not be treated as landlords and are entitled to receive distributed land just like other ordinary peasants ,
( 13 ) Class Elements of Persons After Intermarriage Between Landlords , Rich Peasants and Capitalists on One Side and Workers , Peasants and Poor People on the Other
( 1 ) The class elements of persons after intermarriage between landlords , rich peasants and capitalists on one side and workers , peasants and poor people on the other are determined by the time of their marriage ( either before the revolution or after ) , the original class elements of the two persons , and their living conditions after the -marriage .
( 2 ) Married Before the Revolution : Those women from landlord , rich peasant and capitalist families who married workers , peasants or poor people and depend on labor as their main source of living for a full year are recognized as workers , peasants or poor people .
The class elements of those who are not engaged in labor or have not engaged in labor for a full year remain unchanged .
Women from families or workers , peasants or poor people married into families of landlords , rich peasants and capitalists are regarded as possessing class elements of landlords , rich peasants or capitalists if they have lived as landlords , rich peasants or capitalists for 5 full years .
If their living conditions are not the same as those of landlords , rich peasants or capitalists , but the same as those of workers , peasants and poor people , or if their living conditions have been the same as those of landlords , rich peasants or capitalists for less than 5 years , their original class elements remain unchanged .
( 3 ) Married After the Revolution : The original class elements of women from families of workers , peasants or poor people married into the families of landlords , rich peasants or capitalists remain unchanged .
Women from families of landlords , rich peasants or capitalists married into the families of workers , peasants and poor people -must engage in labor and must have depended on labor as their main source of living for 5 full years before they can be recognized as workers , peasants or poor people .
If they are not engaged in labor , or have not engaged In labor for 5 years , their class elements remain unchanged ,
( 4 ) The class elements of the children are the same as those of their father , regardless of the time of @-@ marriage of their parents .
( 5 ) Before the revolution , workers , peasants and poor people often sold their sons and daughters to families of landlords , rich peasants and capitalists .
Also before the revolution , the son of a worker , peasant or poor person might have -married the daughter of a landlord , rich peasant or capitalist and lived with his wife * s family .
It is also possible that
the son of a landlord , rich peasant or capitalist might have married the daughter of a worker , peasant or poor person and lived with his wife &apos;s family .
The class elements of sold sons and daughters and those sons @-@ in @-@ law who live with their wives &apos; families are determined according to regulations stated in ( 1 ) through ( 4 ) .
( 6 ) Before the revolution , sons of one class were often adopted by families of another class .
Regardless of the age of the boy at the time of adoption , if the son of a worker , peasant or poor man adopted by a landlord , rich peasant or capitalist has lived with and shared the same living conditions of his foster parents for more than 5 years from the age of 10 , then his class element is the same as that of his foster parents .
If his living conditions are not the same as those of his foster parents but are the same as those of his natural parents , then his original class elements remain unchanged .
Sons of landlords , rich peasants or capitalists adopted by workers , peasants or poor people who share the living conditions of their foster parents for 3 full years have the same class elements as those of their foster parents .
If their living conditions are not the same as those of their foster parents but are the same as those of their natural parents , then their original class elements remain unchanged .
( Explanation ) The so @-@ called labor here includes household labor .
( When Paragraph 3 of this article concerning the unchanged class elements of women from the family of workers , peasants and poor people married into the families of landlords , rich peasants or capitalists after the revolution is applied now , those who are married into the families of landlords and rich peasants after the revolution should be interpreted as after the land reform , and those who are married into the families of capitalists should be treated according to Paragraph 2 of this article.CCP Central Committee Note )
( 14 ) Landlords and Rich Peasants Who Are Also Engaged in Industrial and Commercial Enterprises
( 1 ) The land , houses and property on .
the land of landlords who are also engaged in industrial and commercial enterprises are to be confiscated , Their industrial and commercial enterprises and their stores , residences and property related to such enterprises are not to be confiscated .
( 2 ) The land , houses and property on the land of rich peasants who are also engaged in industrial or commercial enterprises should be treated as those belonging to rich peasants .
Their industrial or commercial enterprises and their stores , residences and property related to such enterprises are to be treated in the same way as- those belonging to industrial and commercial enterpreneurs .
( 15 ) Management of Public Land and Property
Management of public land and property is a kind of exploitation .
However , management of landlords , rich peasants and capitalists is different from management by workers , peasants and poor people .
( Explanation ) Management of public property means management of the land and property of shrines , temples , societies and associations .
Management of such land and property is undoubtedly a kind of exploitation .
Especially when landlords and rich peasants amass a large amount of land and property in the name of shrines , temples , societies and associations , this practice becomes one of the main forms of feudalist exploitation .
All kinds of exclusive control by a few people over public land and property which yields a large amount of income from feudalist--exploitation of course constitutes one of the class elements of the managers .
But there are some small shrines , temples , societies or associations which are managed by workers , peasants and poor people in rotation .
The amount of exploitation is very small .
Management of such small public land and property , therefore , cannot be regarded as constituting a class element of the managers .
Some people think that anybody who has ever managed public land and property is a landlord , rich peasant or a capitalist .
This is wrong .
( 16 ) Livelihood of Some Workers
Workers in the organizations of the democratic regime and other revolutionary organizations and the family members of these workers who have not received any distributed land and have special difficulties in their livelihood should be given some land or helped by some , other method to overcome their difficulties .
( Explanation ) The central government has already issued instructions as to the method of resolving the livelihood problems of government workers who have already received land ( that is , mobilizing the masses to work the land of these government workers ) .
This article refers only to those government workers who have not received land .
The so @-@ called family members include parents , wife , and children below the age of 16 .
( 17 ) Land for Public Interest
During land distribution in the newly liberated area and redistribution of land found in the process of land investigation in the old liberated areas , certain land should be reserved so that the income from such land may be used for bridge repairs , ferries , tea kiosks and other purposes .
( Explanation ) The wages for bridge or ferry repairers , the wage of boatmen , the cost of tea , and the cost of other public welfare are determined by the local chu or hsiang government according to need .
A portion of the land should be set aside , and the masses should be mobilized to cultivate such land .
( 18 ) The Problem of Debts
( .1 ) All debts of workers , peasants and poor people , principle and interest , arising from borrowing of goods or money from landlords and rich peasants before the revolution are abolished , except debts incurred for goods bought from stores on credit .
Monies or goods deposited by workers , peasants and poor people with landlords and rich peasants should be returned .
( .2 ) Those who depend upon exploitation through high interest on loans as the main source of living for the entire family and whose living conditions are better than those of ordinary middle peasants are called usurpers .
Usurpers should be treated as landlords .
( 3 ) All debts incurred after the revolution without violating the &quot; Temporary Loan Regulations &quot; promulgated by the Chinese Democratic Central Government should be paid .
tExplanation ) ( 1 ) Most of the loans granted in the past and in the Kuomntang @-@ ruled areas , no matter whether they are cities or rural areas , are a form of high ^ interest exploitation .
However , those who do not depend on high @-@ interest money lending as their main source of income for the whole family cannot be called usurpers and should be treated according to their class elements .
It is not right to regard all those who exploit others through high @-@ interest loans as &quot; usurpers.n
C2 ) The class elements of those who lend money and at the same time borrow money should be determined by the balance of their indebtedness and the amount of their credit due from borrowers , the nature and amount of the credit balance , and the person &apos;s relationship with others in respect to exploitation ,
( 3 ) The reason that debts arising from purchases of goods on credit must be paid is to protect the merchants from suffering losses .
Furthermore , such credits on goods given by merchants generally do not fall under the category of high @-@ interest loans .
( 4 ) Among the workers , peasants and poor people , debts should be settled between the debtors and creditors themselves .
If the two parties cannot reach a settlement , decisions will be made by the local democratic government .

A certain person in authority

A complete list of war criminals can be compiled only after the names have been proposed by the various fields in the nation according to actual conditions .

JOINT STATEMENT OF CHINA1 S DEMOCRATIC PARTIES AGAINST THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY
3 April 1949
&#91; TextJ The governments of America , Canada , England , France , Norway , Denmark , Iceland , Holland , Belgium , Luxembourg , Portugal and Italy will sign the North Atlantic Treaty on 4 April .
It Is a treaty which endangers the peace and security of mankind and is for the purpose of provoking a new aggressive world war .
As world peace is indivisible , as the nations and peoples of the East and West must share peace and danger , and as the governments of America and England actually are vigorously attempting to introduce the model of the North Atlantic Treaty in the Pacific , the democratic parties and factions of China hereby express their firm opposition to the North Atlantic Treaty and all other similar aggressive schemes .
The democratic parties and factions of China censure the American imperialist government and its dependencies for breaching the Potsdam and other agreements safeguarding international peace , for betraying the United Nations , and for their policy of aggression , which is contrary to the desires of the people of all nations for peace .
They wish to express their enthusiastic sympathy with and sincere support for the struggles against the dangers of a new war waged by the world forces of peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union .
They firmly believe that such struggles will make the warmongering imperialists and their running dogs in the various nations encounter the censure of the peaceful people of the whole world and become isolated , and will bankrupt the conspiracy for a new aggressive world war .
We feel that the world belongs to the people , not to the imperialists and their running dogs .
Their arrogance and violence are merely temporary , and all their conspiracies and plots , and they themselves , will be exposed by the people and discarded .
On behalf of the great Chinese people , China &apos;s democratic parties and factions solemnly declare : If the aggressive imperialist group has the audacity to provoke a reactionary war endangering the people of the whole world , then we will rally the people of the entire nation , follow Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen &apos;s immortal testament , adopt the necessary means , join hands and advance
together with China &apos;s ally ?
the Soviet Union . ?
and the forces of peace and democracy of all nations . , wage a firm struggle against the instigators of aggressive war , defeat the aggressors , overthrow the entire imperialist system , and realize the liberation of all mankind and permanent peace , We feel that , if war breaks out , the aggressive imperialist nations will fail and the anti @-@ imperialist victimized nations will win .
Such a prospect has been clearly indicated to the people of the world by the experience of World War II .

PROCLAMATION OF THE PARTIES AND BODIES OF THE PREPARATORY COMMITTEE OF THE NEW POLITICAL CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE IN COMMEMORATION OF THE 12TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OUTBREAK OF THE WAR OF RESISTANCE ON 7 JULY
7 July 1949
&#91; Text &#93; In commemoration of the 12th anniversary .of the &quot; 7 July &quot; resistance war , the parties , factions and organizations of the preparatory committee for the new Political Consultative Conference issued the following declaration :
Ever since our nation began its great patriotic war against the Japanese aggressors on 7 July 1937 , &quot; 7 July &quot; &quot; this year is the most joyous and encouraging commemoration .
Due to the victory of the people &apos;s liberation war and the formation of the preparatory committee for the new Political Consultative Conference , the many demands of the people which were not fulfilled during the resistance war on a national scale have begun to be fulfilled .
The people &apos;s liberation war of the past 3 years was actually a continuation of the 8 @-@ year resistance war begun 12 years ago .
The people of our entire country were the first to fight the aggressive fascist forces on the eastern front and , after 8 years of struggle and tremendous sacrifices , gained final victory alongside our allies .
Nevertheless , it is well known throughout the world that , after the end of the war , the Chinese people , having suffered great wounds and intense pain , not only did not attain the goal of the war but encountered new and grave calamities .
We sought national independence in the resistance war , but the American and Kuomintang governments forced us to become American colonial slaves , We sought democratic reform in the resistance war , But the American and Kuomintang governments forced us to accept Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s fascist terror .
We sought domestic peace after the conclusion of the resistance war , in order to resume and develop national construction , but the American Government fully supported the Kuomintang government in tearing up the cease @-@ fire agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and in launching a large @-@ scale antipeople civil war , and the people &apos;s loss of life and property was greater than that during the period of the Japanese
aggression .
That the American imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries had the audacity to act so perversely was because they thought their strength was greater than that of the people .
Yet they made the wrong assessment .
The Chinese people , who needed 8 years and the cooperation of the various nations before defeating the Japanese aggressors , have , after 3 years , basically defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries supported by the American Government .
Though the remnant forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries are still attempting to make a last struggle , it will not be long before they are all eliminated .
The preparatory committee for a new Political Consultative Conference representing the will of the Chinese people has been organized , and a new Political Consultative Conference will soon be convened to create a democratic coalition government and begin the construction of a new China .
While they are building their own new nation , the Chinese people naturally wish to establish diplomatic relations with all foreign governments which treat us with equality and friendship , because it is compatible with the interests of our state and people .
Meanwhile , we naturally wish to oppose aggression and threats in any form , because they are incompatible with the interests of our state and people .
While opposing all types of aggression and threats , we must specially mention the Japan issue .
As China is nearest to Japan In distance and closest to it in relationship , and as China was the earliest and largest country to resist it over the longest period of time , China &apos;s opinion on the Japan issue must be sought , and the unilateral acts and unauthorized decisions of the American Government must never be permitted .
Though China suffered the aggression of Japanese imperialism , the people of China and Japan are willing to coexist peacefully and establish economic and cultural cooperation under the conditions of demilitarization and democratization according to the Potsdam Agreement .
Nevertheless , the common desire of the Chinese and Japanese people is being blocked , and American imperialism , which is invading China , is in control of Japan .
Instead of implementing the Potsdam Agreement , the Japan policy of the American Government and military command headquarters is designed to overthrow that agreement .
Instead of demilitarizing and truly democratizing Japan , they want Japan to become antidemocratic and to continue to militarize .
The American Government is unwilling to sign a peace treaty with Japan promptly but plans to postpone it and to occupy Japan indefinitely , so that Japan will not be able to establish peaceful relations with China or any other foreign country and will only serve as America &apos;s colony and military base .
Obviously , this reactionary policy of the American Government is a direct threat to the Chinese and Japanese people and constitutes severe exploitation of the Japanese people .
While we commemroate the 12th anniversary of the outbreak of the great resistance war , China &apos;s democratic parties and factions , peopleTs organizations , and democratic forces of all fields must call the attention of the whole world to the following : To finally realize the goal of the resistance war , we unanimously demand the prompt conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan ; we unanimously demand that , in the drawing up of a peace treaty with Japan , the procedure prepared by the foreign ministers of the four nations as
provided in the Potsdam Agreement be strictly followed , and that China &apos;s democratic coalition government created by its new Political Consultative Conference be permitted to send plenary representatives .
The future of the Chinese people will not be without difficulties , but no difficulty can block our progress ; our struggle has never been isolated or unaided .
In the international democratic camp we have powerful allies , primarily the Soviet Union and then the new democracies , the people of the colonies and semicolonies struggling for independence , and the people of the whole world struggling for peace and democracy .
The strength of the international democratic camp more and more surpasses that of the imperialist camp .
Though aiding the Kuomintang reactionaries with all its might , the imperialist camp has no power to block the victory of the Chinese people .
Though signing the North Atlantic Treaty in preparation for a new aggressive war , the imperialist camp has no power to block the victory of the Soviet diplomacy of peace , such as the agreement on the principle of the unification of Germany and the peace treaty with Austria recently reached at the four @-@ power foreign ministers conference .
Though vigorously advertising the so @-@ called Marshall Plan , the imperialist camp has no power to block the outbreak of the economic crisis of America and England , and the time for this outbreak is imminent .
The direction of world development is determined by the strength of the anti @-@ imperialist camp of peace and democracy , not by imperialism and the reactionaries of the nations .
Imperialism and the reactionaries of the nations have now lost their initiative ; they are in a passive position , walking toward their graves .
Unite , all people of China !
Unite , people of the whole world !
Struggle against the imperialist aggressors and for world peace and democracy !

&#91; Text &#93; HSIN @-@ HUA NEWS AGENCY , Peiping , 13 AugAt the conference of delegates of all fields in Peiping this afternoon , Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Tse @-@ tung made a short and concise speech .
He congratulated the conference for its success and expressed hope that all cities in the nation will promptly hold similar conferences , reinforce the links between the government and the people , aid the government in all items of construction work , overcome the difficulties , and thereby prepare the conditions for a popularly elected peopleTs congress .
Chairman Mao said :
As soon as the conditions are ripe , the people &apos;s delegates conference , in its present form , will perform the functions of the people &apos;s congress , serve as the city &apos;s supreme organ of power , and elect a city government .
Judging from conditions in Peiping , this probably can be done in a few months .
The advantages are many , and I hope the delegates will intensify the preparations .
Chairman Mao appealed to all the people of Peiping , except the Kuomintang reactionary remnants and the concealed secret service elements , to unite and struggle to overcome the difficulties and build a people &apos;s capital .

CHAIRMAN MAO &apos;S OPENING SPEECH AT THE FIRST SESSION OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE &apos;S POLITICAL CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE
21 September 1949
&#91; Text &#93; The following is the opening speech of Chinese Communist Party Central Committee Chairman Mao Tse @-@ tung at the first session of the Chinese People &apos;s Political Consultative Conference :
Delegates , the Political Consultative Conference eagerly hoped for by the people of the entire country is now in session .
Our conference is attended by over 600 delegates , representing all the democratic parties and factions , the people &apos;s organizations , the PLA , the areas , the minorities , and the Overseas Chinese .
It indicates that ours is a conference of the great unity of the people of the entire nation .
The success of this great unity of the people is a result of our victory over the Kuomintang reactionary government aided by American imperialism .
In a little over 3 years the courageous and outstanding PLA defeated the several million troops of the Kuomintang reactionary government aided by America and shifted to counterattack and offensive .
Currently , several million troops of the PLA field forces have reached the vicinities of Taiwan , Kwangtung , Kwangsi , Kweichow , Szechwan and Sinkiang , and the majority of the Chinese people have gained liberation .
In a period of 3 @-@ odd years the people of the entire country united , aided the PLA , resisted the enemies , and won a fundamental victory .
The people &apos;s Political Consultative Conference today is convened on this foundation .
The reason we have convened the Political Consultative Conference is that 3 years ago we held a similar conference with Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s Kuomintang .
The conference at that time was sabotaged by Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s Kuoraintang and its accomplices , but it left an indelible impression on the people .
It proved that nothing favorable to the people could be accomplished with imperialist running dog Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s Kuomintang and its accomplices , that even if we barely managed to do the work it would be of no benefit , and that the moment they had the opportunity they would tear up all the resolutions and oppose the people with a cruel civil war .
The only product of that conference was its profound lesson to the people , enabling them to
understand that there was no room for compromise with imperialist running dog Chiang Kai @-@ shek &apos;s Kuomintang and its accomplices ; either we overthrew such enemies or were killed and oppressed by them , either one or the other , without any other way .
Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party , the Chinese people , in a period of 3 @-@ odd years , rapidly became conscious , organized themselves , formed a united front on a national scale to resist imperialism , feudalism , and bureaucratic capitalism and its representative , the reactionary Kuomintang government , aided the people &apos;s liberation war , basically smashed the reactionary Kuomintang government , overthrew imperialist control in China , and restored the Political Consultative Conference .
The current Chinese People &apos;s Political Consultative Conference is convened on a completely new foundation .
It represents the people of the entire country and has their confidence and support .
Therefore , it declares that it will perform the functions of the National People &apos;s Congress .
It will formulate its own organization law , the organization law of the Central People &apos;s Government of the People &apos;s Republic of China , and the common program of the Political Consultative Conference , elect the Political Consultative Conference National Committee and the Central People &apos;s Government Committee , decide on the national flag and national emblem of the People &apos;s Republic of China , determine the location of the capital , and adopt the calendar followed by the majority of the nations of the world .
Delegates : We have a common feeling that our work will be recorded in the history of mankind .
It will show that the Chinese people , constituting one @-@ quarter of mankind , have stood up .
The Chinese people have always been a great , courageous , and industrious people , but they have dropped behind in modern times .
This was completely the result of the oppression and exploitation of foreign imperialism and domestic reaction .
In the past century or more our forebears never stopped their indomitable struggles against Internal and external oppressors .
Such struggles included the 1911 revolution led by China &apos;s great revolutionary pioneer , Dr Sun Yat @-@ sen .
Our forebears instructed us to carry out their wishes , and we have now done so .
We rallied together , smashed the internal and external oppressors by means of the people &apos;s liberation war and the great .people &apos;s revolution , and declared the founding of the People &apos;s Republic of China .
Our nation will , from now on , become a member of the big family of all peace @-@ loving and freedom @-@ loving nations of the world , working with a courageous and industrious attitude and creating our own civilization and happiness , while also promoting the peace and freedom of the world .
Our nation will never again be humiliated .
We have stood up .
Our revolution has won the sympathy and applause of the broad masses throughout the world ; our friends are found everywhere .
Our revolutionary work has not ended .
The peopleTs liberation war and the people &apos;s revolutionary movement are still progressing , and we must continue our efforts .
The .
imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never accept their failure but will make a last &apos; desperate struggle .
Even after the whole country is settled , they will sabotage and disrupt in all kinds of ways ; they will attempt a restoration in China every day and every hour .
This is inevitable and without doubt .
We must not relax our vigilance .
Our state system of the people &apos;s democratic dictatorship is an effective weapon for safeguarding the victorious results of the people &apos;s revolution and resisting the restoration conpsiracies of internal and external enemies .
We must tightly grasp this weapon .
Internationally , we must ally with all peace @-@ loving and freedom @-@ loving nations and peoples , primarily the Soviet Union and the new democracies , so that our struggles to safeguard the victorious results of the people &apos;s revolution and resist the restoration conspiracies of internal and external enemies will not be conducted in isolation .
As long as we adhere to the people &apos;s democratic dictatorship and unity with our international friends , we will always be successful .
The people &apos;s democratic dictatorship and unity with our international friends will bring rapid success to our construction work .
Economic construction on a national scale confronts us .
Our most favorable conditions are the 475 million people and 9.597 million square kms of land .
We will have difficulties ahead of us , and many , but we believe that all difficulties will be surmounted by the courageous struggles of the people of the whole country .
The Chinese people have extremely abundant experiences in overcoming difficulties .
If our forebears and we ourselves could survive extremely arduous times over a long period and overcome powerful internal and external reactionaries , why can &apos;t we build a prosperous and flourishing nation after our victory ?
As long as we preserve our work style of arduous struggle , as long as we unit , and as long as we adhere to the people &apos;s democratic dictatorship and unity with our international friends , we will rapidly win victories on the economic front .
With the arrival of the high tide of economic construction , a high tide of cultural construction will be inevitable .
The time when the Chinese were considered uncivilized has passed , and we will emerge in the world as a highly civilized nation .
Our national defense will become consolidated , and no imperialist will be permitted to invade our land .
On the foundation of the courageous and tested PLA , our people &apos;s armed forces must be preserved and developed .
We will have not only a powerful army but also a powerful air force and a powerful navy .
Let the internal and external reactionaries tremble in fear before us ; let them say that we are no good at this or at that ; the Chinese people , by their indomitable effort , will steadily achieve their goal .
Long live the people &apos;s heroes sacrificed in the people &apos;s liberation war and the people &apos;s revolution !
Celebrate the victories of the people &apos;s liberation and the people &apos;s revolution !
Celebrate the founding of the People &apos;s Republic of China !
Celebrate the success of the Chinese People &apos;s Political Consultative Conference !
